ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute "forward looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Report, the "Executive Level Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW The Company manufactures and installs home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in North America and Europe (including repair and remodeling and new construction), the importance of and the Companys relationships with key customers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 21 percent of the Companys sales in 2005), the Companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition, the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure and the availability and cost of raw materials. The Companys International business faces political, monetary, economic and other risks that vary from country to country, as well as fluctuations in European currency exchange rates. Further, the Company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk. In addition, product liability claims and other litigation could be costly. These factors are discussed in more detail in Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Report. Historically, the Company has largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in the new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions, acquisitions and market share gains. While acquisitions have enabled the Company to build the critical mass that has given the Company strong positions in the markets it serves, the Company has put less emphasis on growth through acquisitions to focus on organic sales growth. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 12 REVENUE RECOGNITION AND RECEIVABLES The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. INVENTORIES Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS The Company maintains investments in marketable securities, which aggregated $115 million, and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $262 million, at December 31, 2005. The investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period, or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions. The investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and unrealized losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recorded as a component of shareholders equity, net of tax effect, in other comprehensive income. The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. Future changes in market conditions, the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. Based on its review, in the third quarter of 2005, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $28 million related to its investment in four million shares of Furniture Brands International (NYSE:FBN) common stock to reduce the cost basis from $25.05 per share to the market value at September 30, 2005 of $18.03 per share. In 2004, the Company also recognized an impairment charge of $21 million related to the Companys investment in FBN. At December 31, 2005, the FBN common stock was in an unrealized gain position; the aggregate carrying value of the investment was $90 million. The FBN common stock, included in marketable securities, was received in June 2002 from the Companys investment in Furnishings International Inc. debt. The Companys investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period, or when circumstances, including the maturity of the fund, indicate impairment may exist. Since there is no active trading market for these investments, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. Based on the Companys review of its private equity funds, the Company considered the decline in the estimated market value of certain of its private equity fund investments to be other than temporary and, accordingly, recognized an impairment charge of $15 million in the third quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2005, the carrying value of the Companys investments in private equity funds exceeded the estimated market value, as determined by the fund managers, by approximately $19 million, which the Company considers to be a temporary decline in the estimated fair value. 13 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in the fourth quarter of each year, or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Companys judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. The Company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. This test for 2005 indicated that goodwill related to certain European businesses was impaired. The Company recognized a non cash, pre tax impairment charge of $69 million ($69 million, after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company reviews its individual indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The Company considers the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales, profit margins and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for obligations. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. The Company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consul 14 tants, lawyers and actuaries. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the Companys consolidated financial statements in any given period. In 2005, the Company decreased its discount rate for obligations to an average of 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent. The discount rate for obligations was based on the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plans liabilities matched to the December 31, 2005 Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. Such rates for the Companys defined benefit pension plans ranged from 4.00 percent to 5.75 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 5.25 percent or higher. The assumed asset return was primarily 8.50 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. The Companys underfunded amount, or the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, increased to $231 million from $193 million in 2004, primarily due to asset returns below projections. Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2005 had a net gain of approximately four percent compared with average returns of five percent for the largest 1,000 Plan Benchmark. The Companys projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans was $143 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $125 million at December 31, 2004. The Company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans to increase by $2 million in 2006 compared with 2005. If the Company assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return, the 2006 pension expense would increase by an additional $2 million. STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS The Companys 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "1991 Plan") in May 2005 and provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms. At December 31, 2005, outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of restricted long term stock awards, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards and stock options. Additionally, the Companys 1997 Non Employee Directors Stock Plan (the "1997 Plan") provides for the payment of part of the compensation to non employee Directors in Company common stock. Restricted Long Term Stock Awards Long term stock awards are granted to key employees and non employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share dilution as the Company continues the practice of reacquiring an equal number of shares on the open market. The unvested stock awards, aggregating $185 million (9 million common shares) at December 31, 2005 are included as a reduction in shareholders equity and are being expensed based on the respective vesting periods, principally 10 years. Compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Stock Options Fixed price stock options are granted to key employees and non employee Directors of the Company. The grant date exercise price equals the market price of Company common stock on the date of grant. These options generally become exercisable in installments beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date. Restoration stock options under the 1991 Plan become exercisable six months from the date of grant. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options, except for restoration options resulting from the options granted under the 1991 Plan. 15 The Company began using the fair value method of accounting for options granted, modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003, and options granted prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be accounted for using the intrinsic value method as of December 31, 2005. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," using the Modified Prospective Application ("MPA") method. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure and recognize the cost (fair value) of employee services received in exchange for stock options. The MPA method will require the Company to record expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining vesting periods. The expense for unvested stock options at January 1, 2006 will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123. Changes to the grant date fair value of stock options granted before January 1, 2006 are prohibited. The MPA method does not require the restatement of prior year information. The amount of expense related to total unvested stock options remaining at December 31, 2005 was $104 million; such options have a weighted average vesting period of over 3 years. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2005: risk free interest rate 4.1%, dividend yield 2.3%, volatility factor 35.8% and expected option life 7 years. For SFAS No. 123R calculation purposes, the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares, including restoration options, granted in 2005 was $10.33 per option share. The fair value for each option grant is calculated and the related expense is recorded over the vesting period of the option grant. If the Company increased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2005 would increase 44 percent. If the Company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2005 would decrease 55 percent. INCOME TAXES The Company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, related to its after tax foreign tax credit carryforward of $50 million. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims (including income taxes) with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. See Note U to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company. 16 CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY Acquisitions in past years have enabled the Company to build a critical mass that has given the Company a strong position in the markets it serves and has increased the Companys importance to its customers. The Company is now intensifying its focus on leveraging the critical mass to build greater value for its shareholders. The Companys focus includes additional cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing synergies among the Companys business units. The Company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy of organic growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital. As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to continuing operations. In 2003, the Company completed the sale of its Baldwin Hardware, Weiser Lock and Marvel Group businesses. Total gross proceeds from the sale of Baldwin Hardware, Weiser Lock and Marvel Group were $289 million; the Company recognized a pre tax net gain on the disposition of these businesses of $89 million. In 2004, the Company determined that several European businesses were not core to the Companys long term growth strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of disposition (the "2004 Plan"). During 2004, in separate transactions, the Company completed the sale of its Jung Pumpen, The Alvic Group, Alma Kuchen, E. Missel and SKS Group businesses in Europe. In 2004, the Company reduced its estimate of expected proceeds and recognized pre tax charges of $139 million ($151 million including tax effect) for those businesses that were expected to be divested at a loss. Any gains resulting from the dispositions were recognized as such transactions were completed. Total gross proceeds from the sale of these companies were $199 million, including cash of $193 million and notes receivable of $6 million. The Company recognized a pre tax, net gain (principally related to the sale of Jung Pumpen) on the disposition of these businesses of $106 million. During 2005, in separate transactions, the Company disposed of its Gebhardt Consolidated and GMU Group businesses in Europe as part of the Companys 2004 Plan. Gebhardt Consolidated supplies ventilation products and GMU Group manufactures cabinets. Total gross proceeds from the sale of Gebhardt Consolidated and GMU Group were $130 million; the Company recognized a pre tax net gain (principally related to the sale of Gebhardt Consolidated) on the disposition of these businesses of $9 million. Net proceeds from the disposition of businesses completed in 2005 and 2004, pursuant to the Companys 2004 Plan, aggregated $280 million. Also during 2005, in separate transactions, the Company completed the disposition of Zenith Products and Aran Group; such dispositions were completed pursuant to the Companys determination that these business units were not core to the Companys long term cabinet platform strategy. Zenith Products manufactures bathroom storage and organization products for the North American retail market and Aran Group is a European manufacturer of assembled and ready to assemble kitchen cabinets; both business units were in the Cabinets and Related Products segment. Total gross proceeds from the sale of Zenith Products and Aran Group were $189 million; the Company recognized a pre tax net gain (principally related to the sale of Zenith Products) on the disposition of these businesses of $50 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," the Company accounted for the businesses held for sale at December 31, 2004, as well as other businesses which were sold in 2005, 2004 and 2003, as discontinued operations. There were no businesses held for sale at December 31, 2005. The sales and results of operations of the businesses sold in 2005, 2004 and 2003 are included in the Companys results from discontinued operations through the date of disposition. During the time the Company owned these businesses, they had net sales of $242 million, $581 million and $758 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and income (loss) from 17 discontinued operations before income taxes of $39 million, $5 million and $(10) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations, long term bank debt and other borrowings, and by the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds. At December 31, 2005, debt agreements with banks syndicated in the United States relate to a $2.0 billion 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement which expires in November 2009. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros. Interest is payable on borrowings under this agreement based on various floating rate options as selected by the Company. In February 2006, the Company amended the terms of the $2.0 billion 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement; the amendment primarily affected the requirement for the Company to maintain certain levels of net worth. The 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, contains limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2005, the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $2.5 billion. The 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, also contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2005, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately $842 million. At December 31, 2005, the amount of debt and equity securities issuable under the Companys unallocated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission was $1.5 billion. The Company had cash and cash investments of $1,964 million at December 31, 2005 as a result of strong cash flows from operations, proceeds from the disposition of certain businesses and financial investments, and the issuance of fixed rate debt. During 2005, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend 11 percent to $.20 per common share. This marks the 47th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Although the Company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years, the Company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the Company. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 49 percent at December 31, 2005 from 44 percent at December 31, 2004. Repurchases and retirement of Company common stock contributed to the increase in the total debt to total capitalization ratio. The Companys working capital ratio was 1.8 to 1 and 2.1 to 1 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decline in the current ratio is primarily due to the reclassification to current liabilities of $800 million of 6.75% notes that are due and payable on March 15, 2006. The Company intends to use a portion of its cash to retire the notes due March 2006. The derivatives used by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2005 consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2005, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. Generally, under interest rate swap agreements, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges, and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement. 18 For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings. The average variable interest rates are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a fixed adjustment factor. The average effective rate on the interest rate swaps was 5.519%. At December 31, 2005, the interest rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of $850 million of the Companys fixed rate debt due July 15, 2012 at an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The amount recognized as a reduction of interest expense was $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the United States dollar and the Great Britain pound. CASH FLOWS Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions: 2005 2004 2003 Net cash from operating activities.......................... $1,374 $1,454 $1,421 Increase (decrease) in debt, net............................ 407 (13) (541) Net proceeds from disposition of: Businesses, net of cash disposed.......................... 278 172 284 Equity investment......................................... 75 Proceeds from settlement of swaps........................... 55 Issuance of Company common stock............................ 33 58 37 Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired.............

(5) 29 52 Other, net.................................................. 22 (15) (32) Cash increase (decrease).......................... $ 670 $ 499 $ (272) The Companys cash and cash investments increased $708 million (including cash at businesses held for sale at January 1, 2005) to $1,964 million at December 31, 2005, from $1,256 million at December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by operations of $1.4 billion consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $241 million, net gain on disposition of businesses of $63 million, net gain on disposition of financial investments of $98 million, income of $6 million related to the Behr litigation settlement, a $69 million charge related to goodwill impairment, a $45 million charge for the impairment of financial investments and other non cash items, including stock based compensation expense, amortization expense related to in store displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon Convertible Notes. The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management, including working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales in accounts receivable decreased to 48 days at December 31, 2005 from 49 days at December 31, 2004, and days sales in inventories decreased to 46 days at December 31, 2005 from 49 days at December 31, 2004. Accounts payable days were 36 days 19 at both December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company continues to implement working capital improvement initiatives. Cash used for financing activities was $885 million, and included cash outflows of $339 million for cash dividends paid, $87 million for the net payment of debt and $986 million for the acquisition and retirement of Company common stock in open market transactions. Cash provided by financing activities included $494 million from the issuance of notes (net of issuance costs) and $33 million from the issuance of Company common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2005, the Company had remaining Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to an additional 29 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. In January 2006, the Company repurchased an additional three million shares of Company common stock and expects to continue its Company common share repurchase program throughout 2006. Cash provided by investing activities was $186 million, and included $278 million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses, $193 million from the net sale of financial investments and $22 million from other net cash inflows. Cash used for investing activities included $282 million for capital expenditures and $25 million for acquisitions and additional acquisition related consideration relating to previously acquired companies. The Company expects to continue to monetize the marketable securities portfolio over the next several quarters. The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing operations and increasing its capacity and its productivity, in order to be a more efficient producer and to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2005 were $282 million, compared with $310 million for 2004 and $271 million for 2003; for 2006, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2006 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $420 million. Capital expenditures for 2006 include significant capacity additions to the Companys North American cabinet operations for which construction is anticipated to be completed in early 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2005 totaled $241 million, compared with $237 million for 2004 and $244 million for 2003; for 2006, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2006 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $250 million. Amortization expense totaled $28 million, $26 million and $32 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales. 20 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States. However, the Company believes that certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results. SALES AND OPERATIONS Net sales for 2005 were $12.6 billion, representing an increase of seven percent over 2004. Excluding results from acquisitions, net sales also increased seven percent compared with 2004. The increase in net sales in 2005 is principally due to continued strength in the new construction market for the Companys cabinet and window products and installation sales, as well as selling price increases for certain products. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2005 2004 Net sales, as reported...................................... $12,642 $11,850 Acquisitions............................................ (21) Net sales, excluding acquisitions........................... 12,621 11,850 Currency translation.................................... 5 Net sales, excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency.................................................. $12,626 $11,850 The Companys gross profit margins were 28.5 percent, 30.9 percent and 30.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the 2005 gross profit margins reflects additional increased commodity, energy and freight costs, as well as a less favorable product mix, offset in part by increased sales volume and increased selling prices for certain products. The 2004 gross profit margins reflected increased sales volume and increased selling prices, offset in part by initial increases in commodity costs, as well as sales in segments with somewhat lower gross margins. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2003 were reduced by non cash, pre tax charges of $59 million relating to two United Kingdom business units. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 15.6 percent in 2005 compared with 16.8 percent in 2004 and 16.9 percent in 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflect lower compensation costs resulting from business unit consolidations and reduced Company financial performance related to incentive compensation, as well as reduced outside professional fees including fees associated with complying with Sarbanes Oxley legislation. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2004 include the benefit of lower promotion and advertising costs offset by higher costs and expenses associated with complying with Sarbanes Oxley legislation and increased expenses associated with stock options. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 include $16 million of accelerated benefit expense related to the unexpected passing of the Companys President and Chief Operating Officer. Operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 includes $6 million, $30 million and $72 million, respectively, of income regarding the Behr litigation settlement. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 12.5 percent, 13.4 percent and 14.0 percent in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding the goodwill impairment charges and the income regarding the Behr litigation settlement, were 13.0 percent, 14.1 percent and 13.8 percent in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased commodity, energy, freight and other petroleum based product costs, which have not been offset by 21 selling price increases, as well as charges aggregating approximately $30 million related to certain profit improvement initiatives. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $45 million, $21 million and $19 million, respectively, of non cash, pre tax charges for the write down of certain financial investments. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $28 million related to its investment of four million shares of Furniture Brands International (NYSE: FBN) common stock to reduce the cost basis from $25.05 per share to the market value at September 30, 2005 of $18.03 per share. In 2004, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $21 million related to the Companys investment in FBN. At December 31, 2005, the FBN common stock was in an unrealized gain position; the aggregate carrying value was $90 million at December 31, 2005. The FBN common stock, included in marketable securities, was received in June 2002 from the Companys investment in Furnishings International Inc. debt. Based on the Companys review of its private equity funds, the Company considered the decline in the estimated market value of certain of its private equity fund investments to be other than temporary and, accordingly, recognized an impairment charge of $15 million in the third quarter of 2005. Other, net in 2005 includes $30 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, dividend income of $16 million and $68 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net in 2005 also includes currency transaction losses of $25 million and other miscellaneous items. Other, net in 2004 includes $50 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, dividend income of $27 million and $42 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net in 2004 also includes currency transaction gains of $26 million and other miscellaneous items. Other, net in 2003 includes $23 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $25 million and $17 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net in 2003 also includes a $5 million gain from the sale of the Companys equity investment in Emco, $7 million of losses on the early retirement of debt, currency transaction losses of $4 million and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense was $247 million, $217 million and $260 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2005 is primarily due to the issuance of fixed rate notes in June 2005, as well as the impact of increasing interest rates. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 is primarily due to debt retirement, as well as the effect of the interest rate swap agreements that converted a certain amount of fixed rate debt to lower variable rate debt and reduced interest expense by $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2005 were $872 million and $2.03 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2005 includes a non cash, pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $69 million ($69 million or $.16 per common share, after tax) and income related to the Behr litigation settlement of $6 million pre tax ($4 million or $.01 per common share, after tax). Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2004 were $949 million and $2.08 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2004 includes a non cash, pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $112 million ($104 million or $.23 per common share, after tax) and income related to the Behr litigation settlement of $30 million pre tax ($19 million or $.04 per common share, after tax). Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2003 were $769 million and $1.57 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2003 includes a non cash, pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $53 million ($47 million or $.10 per common share, after 22 tax) and income related to the Behr litigation settlement of $72 million pre tax ($45 million or $.09 per common share, after tax). The Companys effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 37 percent in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 36 percent for 2006. OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY The Company believes that higher commodity costs experienced in late 2005 will continue to adversely affect its near term operating performance. The Company has already implemented and continues to implement additional selling price increases on a number of its products, and believes that by the end of the first half of 2006, many of these cost increases will be largely offset by such price increases. The Company remains committed to its strategy of value creation and continues to be focused on the simplification of its business model, cash flow generation, improvement in return on invested capital and the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Consistent with this strategy, the Company is pursuing a variety of initiatives to offset cost increases and increase operating profit, including sourcing programs, the restructuring of certain of its businesses (including consolidations), manufacturing rationalization, headcount reductions and other profit improvement programs. While the Company has incurred and will incur additional expenses and charges related to these programs, implementing these initiatives should improve the Companys earnings outlook for 2006 and beyond. As part of its strategy, in January 2006, the Company announced a plant closure in the Plumbing Products segment; costs associated with this plant closure and other profit improvement programs are currently expected to approximate $70 million and are expected to be incurred during 2006. 23 BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

The 2005 goodwill impairment charge was as follows: Plumbing Products $7 million; Decorative Architectural Products $26 million; and Other Specialty Products $36 million. The 2004 goodwill impairment charge was as follows: Plumbing Products $25 million; Decorative Architectural Products $62 million; and Other Specialty Products $25 million. The 2003 goodwill impairment charge was as follows: Plumbing Products $17 million; Decorative Architectural Products $5 million; and Other Specialty Products $31 million. These charges relate to certain of the Companys European businesses. 24 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate expense, the income regarding the litigation settlement and the goodwill impairment charges in 2005, 2004 and 2003. CABINETS AND RELATED PRODUCTS Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased eight percent in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The 2005 sales increases in this segment were primarily attributable to increased sales volume in the new construction market, as well as certain selling price increases. The sales increases in 2004 were primarily due to increased sales volume of assembled cabinets largely through North American retail distribution channels at major home centers and through the new construction market in the United States, as well as a more favorable product mix. This segment was favorably influenced by a weaker U.S. dollar in 2004, which affected the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 15.5 percent, 16.9 percent and 15.1 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight costs, as well as a shift to a less favorable product mix, which offset the positive impact of higher unit sales volume. Operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies due to increased demand for assembled cabinets in North America. The Company has major capital expansion programs to increase North American assembled cabinet manufacturing capacity for both the retail and new construction markets. These new facilities, located in the Western U.S., are expected to be in production in early 2007. Operating profit margins in 2004 reflect the positive impact of higher unit sales volume, as well as certain cost improvement initiatives. PLUMBING PRODUCTS Net sales of Plumbing Products increased four percent in 2005 compared with 2004 principally due to increased sales through the Companys wholesale distribution channel and the increased sales of certain European operations included in this segment. While sales volumes have increased, such increases were offset by a less favorable product mix and by continuing weakness impacting certain products sold through retail markets. Net sales of Plumbing Products increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased sales volume in the retail markets in North America and Europe and in the new construction market in North America. A weaker U.S. dollar also had a favorable impact on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment in 2004. Operating profit margins were 11.8 percent, 12.9 percent and 13.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were adversely affected by charges aggregating $12 million related to certain profit improvement initiatives, including severance costs and costs associated with exiting a product line. The operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were also adversely affected by increased commodity costs, which have not been offset by selling price increases and a less favorable product mix, which more than offset increased sales volume in the wholesale distribution channel. The Companys Plumbing Products segment continues to be negatively impacted by import competition, as well as a product mix shift towards lower margin faucets within the North American retail channels. As part of the Companys strategic review of its businesses, the Company determined that in order to remain competitive, it is necessary to increase off shore sourcing at lower costs, while consolidating and reducing manufacturing operations in North America. Consistent with this determination, in January 2006, the Company announced a North American plant closure in this segment; the costs and expenses associated with this plant closure and other profit improvement initiatives are expected to approximate $70 million and 25 will be incurred during 2006. The Company anticipates that this closure will improve the outlook for its plumbing related business beyond 2006. Operating profit margins in 2004 compared with 2003 reflect an increase in European sales (which are generally at lower margins), as well as increased material costs, offset in part by increased sales volume. INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased 11 percent in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased 15 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The increases in net sales in 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to increased selling prices, as well as increased sales volume of non insulation products and continued strength in the new construction market. Operating profit margins were 12.5 percent, 12.9 percent and 15.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The slight decline in the 2005 operating profit margin was primarily attributable to continued increases in sales of generally lower margin, non insulation products, as well as the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to material cost increases, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volume. The 2004 operating profit margin decline was primarily attributable to the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to material cost increases, as well as an increase in sales of generally lower margin, non insulation products. Within the Installation and Other Services segment, the availability of fiberglass insulation to support the Companys installation and distribution activities continues to be constrained. The high level of demand for fiberglass insulation as a result of the continued strong new construction market has outpaced the industrys capacity to produce additional product. The Company believes that these conditions will persist at least through the first half of 2006 and is working with its diverse supplier base to secure the appropriate amount of material. At the current time, the Company believes that it will be able to do so, but if the Company cannot obtain the required amount of material, this could have a negative impact on its operations. DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased four percent in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased 11 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in net sales in 2005 was primarily due to increased selling prices for paints and stains. The increase in net sales in 2004 was primarily due to higher unit sales volume of paints and stains, as well as increased sales of decorative hardware. Operating profit margins were 16.5 percent, 20.6 percent and 14.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins for this segment in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased material and freight costs, which were not completely offset by increased selling prices related to paints and stains. The operating profit margin improvement in 2004 includes the effect of increased sales volume of paints and stains and increased sales volume and improved operating performance of the Companys decorative hardware businesses, offset in part by increased material and promotion costs. Operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were impacted by increased advertising and marketing costs, including additional costs associated with new in store paint display centers, and fixed asset and inventory adjustments reflecting excess, obsolete and resourced products related to decorative hardware. Operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were negatively affected by non cash, pre tax charges of $55 million related to a business system implementation failure at a United Kingdom business unit. OTHER SPECIALTY PRODUCTS Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased four percent in 2005 compared with 2004, principally due to increased sales volume and certain selling price increases of vinyl and fiberglass windows 26 and patio doors to North American new construction markets, which were partially offset by reduced sales of European operations included in this segment. Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased 17 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, principally due to increased sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and doors in North America. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2004 also had a favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 19.7 percent, 19.2 percent and 18.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and the lower results of European operations, reflecting charges related to profit improvement initiatives, offset in part by reduced state use tax expense. The operating profit margin improvement in 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of windows. The operating profit margins in 2003 reflect increased material and insurance costs, as well as lower results of European operations. GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS DISCUSSION NORTH AMERICA Net sales from North American operations increased eight percent in 2005 compared with 2004, and increased 13 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to continued strength in the new construction market and increased sales volume of cabinets, installed sales of insulation and non insulation products, and vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors, as well as increased selling prices for certain products. Operating profit margins were 15.0 percent, 16.6 percent and 16.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by continued increases in commodity, energy, freight and other petroleum based product costs, which have not been offset by selling price increases, partially offset by increased sales volume of cabinets, installation services and windows and patio doors to the new construction market. Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of assembled cabinets, faucets, paints and stains, vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors and installed sales of insulation and non insulation products. Operating profit margins in 2004 were negatively impacted by increased commodity costs, which offset lower sales promotion costs. The operating profit margins in 2003 reflect increased sales in segments that have somewhat lower operating profit margins, increased commodity and energy costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion costs. INTERNATIONAL, PRINCIPALLY EUROPE Net sales of the Companys International operations increased one percent in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to increased local currency sales of exported plumbing products and ready to assemble cabinets, offset in part by declining sales of windows and other plumbing products. Net sales of the Companys International operations increased 22 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, due to increased sales of plumbing products, ready to assemble cabinets and windows. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of European results in 2004, increasing European net sales in 2004 by 12 percent. Operating profit margins were 11.6 percent, 11.6 percent and 8.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating profit margins for 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs and costs associated with certain profit improvement initiatives, as well as a less favorable product mix. Operating profit margins for 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of plumbing products, ready to assemble cabinets and windows. Operating profit margins for International operations for 2003 were adversely affected by the non cash, pre tax charges relating to accounting irregularities discussed previously. 27 OTHER MATTERS COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is set forth in Note U to the consolidated financial statements. Other Commitments With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2005, commitments to contribute up to $95 million of additional capital to such funds, representing the Companys aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to each of its private equity funds, upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of the Companys investment in the private equity fund when paid. During 2000, approximately 300 of the Companys key employees purchased from the Company 8.4 million shares of Company common stock for cash totaling $156 million under an Executive Stock Purchase Program ("Program"). The stock was purchased at $18.50 per share, the approximate market price of the common stock at the time of purchase. During 2005, participants in the Program settled their remaining outstanding five year full recourse personal loans with a bank syndicate. The Company had guaranteed the repayment of the loans; however, all such loans were settled with no requirement for the Company to fulfill such guarantees. The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the Companys products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable. Warranty Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. See Note U to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. A significant portion of the Companys business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Companys revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale. 28 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table provides payment obligations related to current contracts at December 31, 2005, in millions: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 2 3 4 5 MORE THAN 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL Debt (A)................................ $ 832 $1,588 $ 11 $2,344 $4,775 Operating leases........................ 110 123 64 61 358 Private equity funds (B)................ 32 32 31 95 Defined benefit plans................... 38 20 25 70 153 Currently payable income taxes.......... 61 61 Interest (C)............................ 180 297 276 1,124 1,877 Post retirement obligations............. 1 1 4 6 Purchase commitments (D)................ 211 13 224 Total................................. $1,464 $2,074 $408 $3,603 $7,549 (A) The Company has included $876 million related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Notes, which will be the accreted value on January 20, 2007.

(D) Excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments or open or pending purchase orders. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs," which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43. SFAS No. 151 clarifies the treatment of abnormal costs as period costs rather than as a portion of inventory costs. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is effective January 1, 2006, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3." SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including the cumulative effect in net income of the period of the change. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections subsequent to December 31, 2005, and is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of SFAS No. 143," ("FIN 47"). FIN 47 requires recognition of the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities when the obligation is incurred, generally upon acquisition or construction or through normal operation of the asset. Previously, there were diverse accounting practices regarding the recognition and timing of such obligations. The adoption of FIN 47 was effective for the year ended December 31, 2005, and did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 29 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," which supersedes SFAS No. 123, SFAS No. 148 and Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure and recognize the cost (fair value) of employee services received in exchange for stock options. SFAS No. 123R also clarifies and expands guidance in several areas including measuring fair value and classification of employee stock based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the Modified Prospective Application ("MPA") method. The MPA method will require the Company to record expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining vesting periods. The expense for unvested stock options at January 1, 2006 will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123. Changes to the grant date fair value of stock options granted before January 1, 2006 are prohibited. The MPA method does not require restatement of prior year information. The Company expects this additional expense to approximate $7 million pre tax in 2006. The Company has been using the fair value method for options granted, modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the other provisions of SFAS No. 123R will have on its consolidated financial statements. 30 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, "Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments." The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to its marketable securities and other investments. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments. The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005 consist of interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The Company, including certain European operations, also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the United States dollar and the Great Britain pound. At December 31, 2005, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments. Based on the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 31
