Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report, the Executive Level Overview, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Outlook for the Company sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Executive Level Overview The Company manufactures, distributes and installs home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in North America and Europe (including repair and remodeling and new home construction), the importance of and the Companys relationships with key customers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 20 percent of the Companys net sales in 2006), the Companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its U.S. and global markets in the face of increasing competition, the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure and the cost and availability of labor and materials. The Companys international business faces political, monetary, economic and other risks that vary from country to country, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Further, the Company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk. In addition, product liability claims and other litigation could be costly. These and other factors are discussed in more detail in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 12 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Receivables The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. The Company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. Financial Investments The Company has maintained investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $72 million and $211 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through shareholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. The Companys investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a significant adverse affect on the fair value of the investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers include the following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment; a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates; and, any bona fide offers to purchase for less than the carrying value. Since there is no active trading market for these investments, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. In November 2000, the Company reduced its common equity ownership in Metaldyne Corporation (Metaldyne) (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) through a recapitalization merger with an affiliate of Heartland Industrial Partners, L.P. (Heartland), a private equity fund in which the Company had a remaining investment of $17 million at December 31, 2006 (representing less than five percent of the fund). The Company in that transaction retained six percent of the common equity of Metaldyne. At December 31, 2006, the Company also held preferred stock of Metaldyne, which accrues dividends at the annual rate of 15 percent. Additionally, the Company owned an approximate 10 percent investment in TriMas Corporation (TriMas) common stock. Investments in Metaldyne and TriMas are accounted for on the cost basis. During 2006, based upon a review of new information from the Heartland fund concerning fund investments and the continued deterioration of conditions in the automotive supplier and transportation products markets served by Metaldyne and TriMas, the Company determined that the decline in the estimated value of certain of its financial investments was other than temporary. Accordingly, in the 13 Table of Contents second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a non cash, pre tax impairment charge aggregating $78 million for its investments in Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas ($6 million), the Heartland fund ($29 million) and another fund ($3 million) which invested in automotive and transportation related suppliers, including Metaldyne and TriMas. Additionally, based upon the Companys review, the Company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of its other private equity fund investments and other investments to be other than temporary and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of $13 million and $15 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company received new information related to its TriMas investment and determined that the additional decline in the estimated value for this investment was other than temporary. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recognized an additional non cash, pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to its investment in TriMas. On January 11, 2007, the acquisition of Metaldyne by Asahi Tec Corporation, a Japanese automotive supplier, was finalized. The combined fair value of Asahi Tec common and preferred stock received in exchange for the Companys investment in Metaldyne (common and preferred stock) approximates $74 million and the Companys carrying value of the Metaldyne investment was $57 million at December 31, 2006. As a result, a gain of approximately $17 million will be recognized in the first quarter of 2007. Any unrealized gains or losses subsequent to January 11, 2007, will be recognized, net of tax, through shareholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, in the Companys consolidated balance sheet beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the fourth quarter of each year, or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Companys judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. The Company generally develops these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting business units were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its fair value, the Company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets. The excess of the fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting business units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. This test for 2006 indicated that goodwill principally related to certain European business units was impaired. 14 Table of Contents The Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $331 million ($331 million, after tax) in 2006. The pre tax impairment charges recorded in 2006 were as follows: Cabinets and Related Products $316 million; Plumbing Products $1 million; and Decorative Architectural Products $14 million. These charges, principally related to the Companys European manufacturer of ready to assemble cabinets (Tvilum Scanbirk), reflect the long term outlook for that business unit, including declining demand for certain products, as well as decreased operating profit margins. The impairment charge for goodwill related to Tvilum Scanbirk resulted from two significant changes impacting the business unit throughout the year, but particularly in the fourth quarter of 2006. First, there was a fundamental shift in the European ready to assemble raw materials supply market; the change affected the cost structure for raw materials. Second, the Company determined that the business units ability to increase selling prices and maintain revenue growth into the future has become more limited. In the fourth quarter of 2006, as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing, the Company determined that these changes and the impact on operating profit and operating profit margins were permanent in nature. The Company reviews its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The Company considers the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales, profit margins and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Employee Retirement Plans Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the Companys consolidated financial statements in any given period. In 2006, the Company increased its discount rate for obligations to an average of 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent. The discount rate for obligations was based on the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plans liabilities matched to the December 31, 2006 Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. Such rates for the Companys defined benefit pension plans ranged from 4.00 percent to 6.00 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 5.50 percent or higher. The assumed asset return was primarily 8.50 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R, (SFAS No. 158). Among other things, SFAS No. 158 requires companies to prospectively recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets, with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income; such recognition did not affect the Companys consolidated statements of income. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 was effective for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the effect was included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. 15 Table of Contents The Companys underfunded amount for its qualified defined benefit pension plans, the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to $186 million at December 31, 2006 from $231 million at December 31, 2005, primarily due to asset returns above projections; in accordance with SFAS No. 158, the 2006 unfunded amount has been recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2006 had a net return of approximately 11 percent equal to average returns of 11 percent for the largest 1,000 Plan Benchmark. The Companys projected benefit obligation for its unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was $144 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $143 million at December 31, 2005; in accordance with SFAS No. 158, the 2006 unfunded amount has been recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. The Company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans to decrease by $9 million in 2007 compared with 2006. If the Company assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return, the 2007 pension expense would only decrease by $6 million. The Company expects pension expense for its non qualified defined benefit pension plans to decrease by $1 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Stock Based Compensation The Companys 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the 1991 Plan) in May 2005 and provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms. At December 31, 2006, outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of restricted long term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights. Additionally, the Companys 1997 Non Employee Directors Stock Plan (the 1997 Plan) provides for the payment of part of the compensation to non employee Directors in Company common stock. The Company elected to begin recording expense for stock options granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2003. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R) using the Modified Prospective Application (MPA) method. The MPA method requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method does not require the restatement of prior year information. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options at December 31, 2006. For 2006, the Company recognized additional pre tax expense of $15 million ($9 million or $.02 per common share, after tax), related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In addition, during 2006, the Company recognized expense of $3 million (net of income tax benefit of $2 million) as a cumulative effect of accounting change, net, related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and the change from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method of accounting for stock appreciation rights. Restricted Long Term Stock Awards Long term stock awards are granted to key employees and non employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market. There was $195 million (9 million common shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at December 31, 2006, which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will become, retirement eligible during the vesting period, the expense is being recognized over five years, or immediately upon a grantees retirement. Pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was $52 million for 2006. 16 Table of Contents Stock Options Stock options are granted to key employees and non employee Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market price of the Companys common stock at the grant date. These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options, except for restoration options resulting from options granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the date of grant. The Company measures compensation expense for stock options using a Black Scholes option pricing model. For stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years, or immediately upon a grantees retirement. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2006: risk free interest rate 4.89%, dividend yield 3.1%, volatility factor 34.0% and expected option life 7 years. For SFAS No. 123R calculation purposes, the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares, including restoration options, granted in 2006 was $8.24 per option share. If the Company increased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2006 would increase 47 percent. If the Company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2006 would decrease 59 percent. Income Taxes The Company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets related to its after tax foreign tax credit carryforward of $61 million at December 31, 2006. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Other Commitments and Contingencies Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. A significant portion of the Companys business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Companys revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims (including income taxes) with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge and experience of 17 Table of Contents management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. See Note T to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings involving the Company. Corporate Development Strategy In past years, acquisitions have enabled the Company to build strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the Companys importance to its customers. The Companys focus includes the rationalization of its business units, including consolidations, as well as pursuing synergies among the Companys business units. The Company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on organic growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital. As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to the Companys long term growth strategy. In 2004, the Company determined that several European business units were not core to the Companys long term growth strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of disposition (the 2004 Plan). During 2004, in separate transactions, the Company completed the sale of its Jung Pumpen, The Alvic Group, Alma Kuchen, E. Missel and SKS Group business units in Europe. During 2005, in separate transactions, the Company completed the sale of its Gebhardt Consolidated, GMU Group and Aran Group business units in Europe, as well as its Zenith Products business unit in North America. In 2006, the Company completed the sale of Computerized Security Systems (CSS). This disposition was completed pursuant to the Companys determination that this business unit was not core to the Companys long term growth strategy. CSS supplies electronic locksets primarily to hospitality markets in the United States and Europe and was included in the Other Specialty Products segment. As a result of the sale, the Company reclassified the net sales and results of operations related to CSS to discontinued operations. Total gross proceeds from the sale were $92 million; the Company recognized a pre tax net gain (included in discontinued operations) on the disposition of CSS of $51 million. The sales, results of operations and the gains from the 2006, 2005 and 2004 discontinued operations are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated statements of income. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company accounted for the business units which were sold in 2006, 2005 and 2004, except as noted below, as discontinued operations. There were no businesses held for sale at December 31, 2006. During 2006, the Company completed the sale of Gamco Products, General Accessory, Cambridge Brass and Faucet Queens, relatively small businesses, the results of which are included in continuing operations through the date of sale. These businesses had combined net sales and operating profit of $16 million and $5 million, respectively, in 2006 through the respective dates of sale and combined net sales and operating profit of $55 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2005. Gross proceeds from the sale of these businesses were $72 million; the Company recognized a net gain of $1 million in 2006 included in other, net, in continuing operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations, long term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds. At December 31, 2006, the Company had a $2.0 billion 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks syndicated in the 18 Table of Contents United States and internationally, which expires in February 2011. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros with interest payable based upon various floating rate options as selected by the Company. The 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, contains limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2006, the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $1.7 billion. The 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, also contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2006, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by $1.1 billion. At December 31, 2006, the amount of debt and equity securities issuable under the Companys unallocated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission was $500 million. The Company had cash and cash investments of $1,958 million at December 31, 2006 as a result of strong cash flows from operations, proceeds from the disposition of certain businesses and financial investments, and the issuance of fixed rate debt. The Company has maintained investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, principally as part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of tax capital losses, including significant capital losses resulting from the exit of certain businesses over the past several years. The Company determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous to the Company and complement the Companys investment in more liquid, publicly traded marketable securities to balance risk. Since the Company has significantly reduced tax capital losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources, the Company has and will continue to reduce its investments in financial assets. In 2006, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend 10 percent to $.22 per common share. This marks the 48th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 53 percent at December 31, 2006 from 49 percent at December 31, 2005. On October 3, 2006, the Company issued $1 billion of fixed rate 6.125% notes due 2016 in anticipation of the 2007 debt maturities, including the put option related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes. Repurchases and retirement of Company common stock also contributed to the increase in the total debt to total capitalization ratio. The Companys working capital ratio was 1.5 to 1 and 1.8 to 1 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decline in the working capital ratio is primarily due to the reclassification to current liabilities of $823 million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as a result of the put option date of January 20, 2007, $300 million of floating rate notes due March 2007 and $300 million of 4.625% notes due August 2007. On January 20, 2007, holders of $1.8 billion (94 percent) principal amount at maturity of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes (Notes) required the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash value of $825 million. As a result of this repurchase, a $93 million deferred income tax liability will be payable in June 2007. Subsequent to the repurchase, there were outstanding $108 million principal amount at maturity of such Notes with an accreted value of $51 million, which has been included in long term debt at December 31, 2006, as the next put option date is July 20, 2011. The Company may, at any time on or after January 25, 2007, redeem all or part of the Notes at their accreted value. The derivatives used by the Company during 2006 consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2004, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. Generally, under interest rate swap agreements, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges, and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement. For fair value hedge transactions, 19 Table of Contents changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings. The average variable interest rates are based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus fixed adjustment factors. The average effective rate for 2006 on the interest rate swaps was 6.787%. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of $850 million of the Companys fixed rate debt due July 15, 2012 at an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In 2006, the Company recognized an increase in interest expense of $8 million related to this swap agreement, due to increasing interest rates. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the European euro and the Great Britain pound. Cash Flows Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions: 2006 2005 2004 Net cash from operating activities $ 1,208 $ 1,374 $ 1,454 Increase (decrease) in debt, net 151 407 (13 ) Proceeds from disposition of: Businesses, net of cash disposed 160 278 172 Property and equipment 16 37 37 Proceeds from financial investments, net 71 193 330 Issuance of Company common stock 28 33 58 Tax benefit from exercise of stock options 18 Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (28 ) (25 ) (16 ) Capital expenditures (388 ) (282 ) (310 ) Cash dividends paid (349 ) (339 ) (302 ) Purchase of Company common stock (854 ) (986 ) (943 ) Effect of exchange rates 18 (5 ) 29 Proceeds from settlement of swaps 55 Other, net (57 ) (15 ) (52 ) Cash (decrease) increase $ (6 ) $ 670 $ 499 The Companys cash and cash investments decreased $6 million to $1,958 million at December 31, 2006, from $1,964 million at December 31, 2005. Net cash provided by operations of $1.2 billion consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $244 million, net gain on disposition of businesses of $51 million, net gain on disposition of financial investments of $31 million, a $331 million charge for the impairment of goodwill, a $101 million charge for the impairment of financial investments and other non cash items, including stock based compensation expense, amortization expense related to in store displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as well as a net increase in working capital of $57 million. The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management, including working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales in accounts receivable were 50 days at December 31, 2006 compared with 48 days at December 31, 2005, and days sales in inventories were 49 days at 20 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 compared with 46 days at December 31, 2005. Accounts payable days improved to 39 days from 36 days at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a percent of sales was 16.1 percent and 15.9 percent at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used for financing activities was $1.0 billion, and included cash outflows of $349 million for cash dividends paid, $827 million for the retirement of notes and $854 million for the acquisition and retirement of 29 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions. Cash provided by financing activities primarily included $988 million from the issuance of notes (net of issuance costs) and $28 million from the issuance of Company common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2006, the Company had remaining Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to an additional 36 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. In January 2007, the Company repurchased an additional one million shares of Company common stock and expects to continue its share repurchase program throughout 2007. Net cash used for investing activities was $226 million, and included $388 million for capital expenditures and $28 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing activities included $160 million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses and $71 million from the net sale of financial investments. The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing operations and increasing its capacity and its productivity to more efficiently produce and to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2006 were $388 million, compared with $282 million for 2005 and $310 million for 2004; for 2007, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2007 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $300 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2006 totaled $244 million, compared with $241 million for 2005 and $237 million for 2004; for 2007, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2007 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $255 million. Amortization expense totaled $14 million, $28 million and $26 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales. Consolidated Results of Operations The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. However, the Company believes that certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results. Sales and Operations Net sales for 2006 were $12.8 billion, representing an increase of two percent over 2005. Excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales increased one percent compared 21 Table of Contents with 2005. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions: Twelve Months Ended December 31 2006 2005 Net sales, as reported $ 12,778 $ 12,569 Acquisitions (27 ) Net sales, excluding acquisitions 12,751 12,569 Currency translation (23 ) Net sales, excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency $ 12,728 $ 12,569 Net sales for 2006 were adversely affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market in the last six months of the year and a moderation in consumer spending for certain big ticket home improvement items, such as cabinets, partially offset by selling price increases. The Companys gross profit margins were 27.5 percent, 28.5 percent and 30.9 percent in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the 2006 and 2005 gross profit margins reflects additional increased commodity, energy and freight costs, as well as a less favorable product mix, offset in part by increased selling prices for certain products. The 2004 gross profit margins reflected increased sales volume and increased selling prices, offset in part by initial increases in commodity costs, as well as sales in segments with somewhat lower gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 16.1 percent in 2006 compared with 15.5 percent in 2005 and 16.8 percent in 2004. Increased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 reflect increased stock based compensation expense, in part reflecting the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and increased information systems implementation costs and other expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 reflect lower compensation costs resulting from business unit consolidations and reduced Company financial performance related to incentive compensation, as well as reduced outside professional fees including fees associated with complying with Sarbanes Oxley legislation. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2004 include the benefit of lower promotion and advertising costs offset by higher costs and expenses associated with complying with Sarbanes Oxley legislation and increased expenses associated with stock options. Operating profit in 2006 and 2005 includes $47 million and $12 million, respectively, of costs and charges related to the Companys profit improvement programs, principally in the Plumbing Products segment. Operating profit in 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $331 million, $69 million and $112 million, respectively, of impairment charges for goodwill. Operating profit in 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes $1 million, $6 million and $30 million, respectively, of income regarding the Behr litigation settlement. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 8.8 percent, 12.5 percent and 13.4 percent in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding the items above, were 11.8 percent, 13.1 percent and 14.1 percent in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain big ticket home improvement items, such as cabinets, in the last half of 2006, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products, as well as the continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs. These items were partially offset by certain selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased commodity, energy, freight and other petroleum based product costs, which had only been partially offset by selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increased sales volume, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Other Income (Expense), Net During 2006, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $88 million for its investments related to Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas ($16 million), the Heartland fund 22 Table of Contents ($29 million) and another fund ($3 million) which invested in automotive and transportation related suppliers, including Metaldyne and TriMas. Additionally, during 2006, based upon the Companys review, the Company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of its other private equity fund investments and other investments to be other than temporary and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of $13 million. Other, net, for 2006 included $4 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $10 million of dividend income and $27 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2006 also included currency transaction gains of $14 million and other miscellaneous items. During 2005, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $30 million primarily related to its investment in Furniture Brands International common stock. Also during 2005, based upon the Companys review of its private equity funds, the Company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of its private equity fund investments to be other than temporary and, accordingly, recognized an impairment charge of $15 million. Other, net, for 2005 included $30 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $16 million of dividend income and $68 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2005 also included currency transaction losses of $25 million and other miscellaneous items. During 2004, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $21 million related to its investment in Furniture Brands International common stock. Other, net, for 2004 included $50 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $27 million of dividend income and $42 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2004 also included currency transaction gains of $26 million and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense was $240 million, $247 million and $217 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily the result of the repayment of $800 million of 6.75% notes in March 2006, partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion of 6.125% notes in October 2006, as well as the impact of increasing interest rates. The increase in interest expense in 2005 is primarily due to the issuance of fixed rate notes in June 2005, as well as the impact of increasing interest rates. Income and Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2006 were $461 million and $1.15 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2006 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $331 million ($331 million or $.83 per common share, after tax). Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2005 were $866 million and $2.01 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2005 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $69 million ($69 million or $.16 per common share, after tax) and income regarding the litigation settlement of $6 million pre tax ($4 million or $.01 per common share, after tax). Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2004 were $944 million and $2.07 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2004 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $112 million ($104 million or $.23 per common share, after tax) and income regarding the litigation settlement of $30 million pre tax ($19 million or $.04 per common share, after tax). The Companys effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 46 percent in 2006 and 37 percent in both 2005 and 2004. The increased effective tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to an increase in impairment charges for goodwill not being deductible for tax purposes. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 35 to 36 percent for 2007. 23 Table of Contents Outlook for the Company The Companys 2006 results were adversely affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain big ticket home improvement items, such as cabinets, and the continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by profit improvement programs and selling price increases. New home construction has declined dramatically in the last 12 months due to previous excessive speculative buying, rapidly rising home prices in recent years reducing the affordability and less attractive mortgage terms. Housing starts declined by 13 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 to approximately 1.8 million units. Late in 2006, housing starts declined even further to an annual run rate of approximately 1.5 million to 1.6 million units, which is more than 20 percent below the 2005 levels. Even with the recent decline in single family housing starts, the inventory of unsold new homes has increased to unprecedented levels. The Company is proactively managing its business for the current difficult economic times in our markets by pursuing a variety of initiatives to further reduce costs and improve operating profits. Initiatives already started include headcount reductions, sourcing programs, restructuring of certain businesses including consolidations, manufacturing rationalization and other profit improvement programs. While the Companys earnings outlook for 2007 incudes costs related to these initiatives, as well as start up costs related to plant capacity additions, system implementation costs, higher interest expense and as yet unrecovered commodity cost increases, the Company believes that implementing these initiatives should improve the Companys earnings outlook for 2008 and beyond. The Company remains committed to its long term growth strategy, concentrating on organic sales growth, improving return on invested capital and generating significant returns to shareholders. We continue to drive our growth initiatives, including leveraging installation services, developing new channels of distribution, pursuing new markets in emerging economies and emphasizing new product development. 24 Table of Contents Business Segment and Geographic Area Results The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

The 2005 impairment charges for goodwill were as follows: Plumbing Products $7 million; Decorative Architectural Products $26 million; and Other Specialty Products $36 million. The 2004 impairment charges for goodwill were as follows: Plumbing Products $25 million; Decorative Architectural Products $62 million; and Other Specialty Products $25 million. These charges principally related to certain of the Companys European business units. 25 Table of Contents Business Segment Results Discussion Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate expense, net, gains on sale of corporate fixed assets, net, income regarding the litigation settlement, and impairment charges for goodwill in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Profit Improvement Programs As part of its profit improvement programs, the Company has been focused on the rationalization of its Plumbing Products segment. As a result, in 2005, the Company incurred approximately $12 million pre tax of charges related to headcount reductions and the discontinuance of a product line. In addition, the Company announced a plant closure in the Plumbing Products segment in January 2006. During 2006, the Company incurred $39 million pre tax of costs and charges (primarily accelerated depreciation and severance expense) related to this plant closure and other profit improvement programs in the Plumbing Products segment. The Company originally estimated that costs and charges for profit improvement programs related to its Plumbing Products segment would approximate $70 million pre tax compared with the actual charges of $39 million pre tax. The reduced amount reflects the fourth quarter sale of a manufacturing facility in the Plumbing Products segment which was originally planned for closure. In addition, in 2006, the Company incurred $8 million pre tax of costs and charges (including the write down of inventories and accelerated depreciation) related to the closure of a relatively small ready to assemble cabinet manufacturing facility in the Cabinets and Related Products segment. Cabinets and Related Products Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2006 primarily due to lower sales of ready to assemble cabinets in North American and Europe, which more than offset certain selling price increases and sales volume increases of assembled cabinets in North America in the first half of 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 also had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. The 2005 sales increases in this segment were primarily attributable to increased sales volume in the new construction market, as well as certain selling price increases. The operating profit margins in this segment include the negative effect of $8 million of costs and charges related to the closure of a relatively small ready to assemble cabinet manufacturing facility in 2006. Excluding such charges, the operating profit margin was 13.6 percent in 2006. Operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume in the last half of 2006, as well as increased commodity, freight and plant start up costs, offset in part by selling price increases. Operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by lower European operating results, particularly due to lower sales volume of ready to assemble cabinets and increased commodity costs. Operating profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight costs and manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies in North America, as well as a shift to a less favorable product mix, which offset the positive impact of higher unit sales volume. Operating profit margins in 2004 reflect the positive impact of higher unit sales volume, as well as certain profit improvement initiatives. Plumbing Products Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of certain European operations, as well as increased sales volume through the Companys North American wholesale distribution channel. These results were offset in part by declining sales volume to certain retail customers. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 also had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2005 principally due to increased sales through the Companys wholesale distribution channel and the increased sales of certain European operations included in this segment. 26 Table of Contents The operating profit margins in this segment were adversely affected by costs and charges aggregating $39 million and $12 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to certain profit improvement initiatives; excluding such charges, operating profit margins in this segment would have been 9.7 percent and 12.2 percent in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2006 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs, as well as a less favorable product mix and declining sales volume to certain retail customers. The operating profit margins in 2005 were adversely affected by increased commodity costs, which were not offset by selling price increases and a less favorable product mix, which more than offset increased sales volume in the wholesale distribution channel. The operating profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in European sales, as well as increased material costs and an increase in sales volume. The Companys Plumbing Products segment continues to be negatively impacted by import competition, as well as a product mix shift towards lower margin faucets within the North American retail channels. As part of the Companys strategic review of its businesses, the Company determined that in order to remain competitive, it is necessary to increase off shore sourcing at lower costs, while consolidating and reducing manufacturing operations in North America. Consistent with this determination, in January 2006, the Company announced a North American plant closure in this segment; costs associated with this plant closure are included in the profit improvement costs above. Installation and Other Services Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of non insulation products and selling price increases in the first half of 2006. However, the continued slowdown in the new home construction market significantly reduced sales in the second half of 2006 compared with 2005, particularly in the fourth quarter. Net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased selling prices, as well as increased sales volume of non insulation products and continued strength in the new home construction market. The 2006 operating profit margin decline in this segment was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of generally lower margin, non insulation products, as well as increased operating costs to support the segments continued growth in non insulation products, new product development and technology initiatives. The slight decline in operating profit margins in 2005 was primarily attributable to continued increases in sales of generally lower margin, non insulation products, as well as the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to material cost increases, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volume. The decline in operating profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in sales of non insulation products. While the Company experienced constrained availability of fiberglass insulation through the first half of 2006 due to planned availability programs implemented by its vendors, the continued slowdown in new residential construction has now resulted in fiberglass insulation becoming readily available to the Company. At the current time, the Company believes that it will be able to source adequate quantities of insulation materials to meet its needs during 2007. Decorative Architectural Products Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2006 primarily due to selling price increases of paints and stains. Net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased sales volume for paints and stains. The operating profit margins in this segment improved in 2006 due to increased selling prices of paints and stains, which partially offset commodity cost increases experienced in late 2004 and during 2005. The operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased material and freight costs, which were not completely offset by increased selling prices related to paints and stains. The operating profit margins in 2004 include the effect of increased sales volume of paints and stains and increased sales volume and improved operating performance of the Companys decorative hardware businesses, offset in part by increased material and promotion costs. 27 Table of Contents Other Specialty Products Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased in 2006 principally due to lower sales volume of windows and doors, resulting from a slowdown in the new home construction market, particularly in the Western United States. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased in 2005 principally due to increased sales volume and certain selling price increases of doors and windows to the North American new home construction markets, which were partially offset by reduced sales of European operations included in this segment. The operating profit margins in this segment declined in 2006 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors, which offset improved European operating results. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and the lower results of European operations, reflecting charges related to profit improvement initiatives, offset in part by reduced state use tax expense. The operating profit margins in 2004 were primarily attributable to increased sales volume of windows. Geographic Area Results Discussion North America Net sales from North American operations increased slightly in 2006 benefiting from relatively stronger market conditions in the first half of 2006, as well as increased selling prices. An accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending reduced sales volume in the second half of 2006 particularly for assembled cabinets, windows and doors and sales of insulation products. Net sales from North American operations increased in 2005 primarily due to strength in the new home construction market and increased sales volume of cabinets, installation sales of insulation and non insulation products, and sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors, as well as increased selling prices for certain products. Operating profit margins include charges related to the Companys profit improvement programs, principally in the Plumbing Products segment, of $45 million and $12 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding such charges, operating profit margins from North American operations were 14.0 percent and 15.1 percent in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The operating profit margin decline in North American operations is primarily due to sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of ready to assemble cabinets, windows and doors and the installation of insulation products, as well as increased commodity costs, partially offset by selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by continued increases in commodity, energy, freight and other petroleum based product costs, which were only partially offset by selling price increases, and increased sales volume of cabinets, installation services and windows and patio doors to the new home construction market. Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of assembled cabinets, faucets, paints and stains, vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors and installed sales of insulation and non insulation products. Operating profit margins in 2004 were negatively impacted by increased commodity costs, which offset lower sales promotion costs. International, Principally Europe Net sales from International operations increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales of plumbing products, which more than offset lower sales volume of ready to assemble cabinets. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of European results in 2006, increasing European net sales in 2006 by one percent. Net sales from International operations increased in 2005 primarily due to increased local currency sales of exported plumbing products and ready to assemble cabinets, offset in part by declining sales of windows and other plumbing products. Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the lower operating results for European ready to assemble cabinets, which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales 28 Table of Contents volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of other European operations. Operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and costs associated with certain profit improvement initiatives, as well as a less favorable product mix. Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of plumbing products, ready to assemble cabinets and windows. Other Matters Commitments and Contingencies Litigation Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is set forth in Note T to the consolidated financial statements. Other Commitments With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2006, commitments to contribute up to $60 million of additional capital to such funds, representing the Companys aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to its private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of the Companys investment in the private equity fund when paid. The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the Companys products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides payment obligations related to current contracts at December 31, 2006, in millions: Payments Due by Period Less than 2 3 4 5 More than 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Debt (A) $ 1,447 $ 125 $ 54 $ 3,354 $ 4,980 Interest (B) 217 403 399 1,198 2,217 Operating leases 108 122 64 64 358 Currently payable income taxes 61 61 Defined benefit plans 29 23 27 75 154 Private equity funds (C) 20 20 20 60 Acquisition related commitments 2 4 6 Post retirement obligations 1 1 1 4 7 Purchase commitments (D) 273 25 2 300 Total $ 2,158 $ 723 $ 567 $ 4,695 $ 8,143 (A) The Company has included $825 million related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes (Notes), which was the accreted value on January 20, 2007; such Notes were redeemed on the put date according to the terms of the Notes.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Quantifying Financial Statement Misstatements, (SAB 108). Historically, the Company evaluated financial statement misstatements using an iron curtain method, which primarily focused on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the statement of income. SAB 108 clarified that the evaluation of financial statement misstatements must be made based upon all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors; this is referred to as a dual approach. SAB 108 is effective for the year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the provisions of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109, (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on classification, interest and 30 Table of Contents penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The adoption of FIN No. 48 is effective January 1, 2007. Historically, the Company has established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5). Under this standard, reserves for tax contingencies are established when it is probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 48 establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions than the thresholds under SFAS No. 5. Therefore, although the Company has not completed its evaluation of the impact of FIN No. 48 on its consolidated financial statements, it currently estimates that its reserves for income tax contingencies net of any federal tax benefit will increase by approximately $25 million to $45 million, as of the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of applying FIN No. 48 will be recorded as a reduction to beginning retained earnings in 2007. The Company believes that, in future years, there will be a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment to affect the tax reserve computation to a greater degree than SFAS No. 5. In addition, the Company expects to reclassify the majority of its reserves for income tax contingencies from current to non current liabilities in accordance with the provisions of FIN No. 48. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments. The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to its marketable securities and other investments. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments. The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006 consist of interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The Company, including certain European operations, also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the European euro and the Great Britain pound. At December 31, 2006, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 31 Table of Contents
