Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report, the Executive Level Overview, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Outlook for the Company sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Executive Level Overview The Company manufactures, distributes and installs home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of new home construction and home improvement activity principally in North America and Europe, the importance of and the Companys relationships with key customers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 20 percent of the Companys net sales in 2007), the Companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its U.S. and global markets in the face of increasing competition, the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure, and the cost and availability of labor and materials. The Companys international business faces political, monetary, economic and other risks that vary from country to country, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Further, the Company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk. In addition, product liability claims and other litigation could be costly. These and other factors are discussed in more detail in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 16 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Receivables The Company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. The Company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. Financial Investments The Company has maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $114 million and $173 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Investments in available for sale and marketable securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax, through shareholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. During 2007, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges of $6 million related to its investment in Furniture Brands International common stock and $3 million related to its investment in Asahi Tec common stock. From time to time, the Company invests its excess cash in short term financial instruments including auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company revised the classification of investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash investments to available for sale securities included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has also made corresponding adjustments to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, to reflect the gross cash purchases and sales of these securities in cash flows (for) from investing activities. These changes in classification do not affect previously reported consolidated statements of income or cash flows from operating activities in any prior period. During 2007, the Company recognized a non cash, pre tax impairment charge of $3 million related to auction rate securities. On January 11, 2007, the acquisition of Metaldyne Corporation (Metaldyne) (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) by Asahi Tec Corporation (Asahi Tec), a Japanese automotive supplier, was finalized. The combined fair value of the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock, as well as the derivative related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock, received in exchange for the Companys investment in Metaldyne, was $72 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a gain of $14 million, net of transaction fees, included in the Companys consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007, in income from other investments, net. Subsequent to the transaction, the Companys investment in Asahi Tec common and preferred stock is accounted for as available for sale and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of the Asahi Tec common and preferred stock at December 31, 2007 have been recognized, net of tax, through shareholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the unrealized loss of $17 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative 17 Table of Contents related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock, has been included in income from other investments, net. In addition, immediately prior to its sale, Metaldyne distributed shares of TriMas Corporation (TriMas) common stock as a dividend to the holders of Metaldyne common stock; the Company recognized income of $4 million included in the Companys consolidated statement of income, in dividend income from other investments. In May 2007, TriMas made an initial public offering; subsequent to the offering, the Companys investment in TriMas is accounted for as available for sale and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of the investment have been recognized, net of tax, through shareholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Companys investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Impairment indicators the Company considers include the following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment; a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates; and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. Since there is no active trading market for these investments, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than other financial investments. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. During 2007, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges of $10 million related to certain of its investments in private equity funds. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the fourth quarter of each year, or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Companys judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. The Company generally develops these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting business units were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its fair value, the Company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit, including any 18 Table of Contents previously unrecognized intangible assets. The excess of the fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting business units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. In 2007, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $177 million ($177 million, after tax). The pre tax impairment charges recorded in 2007 were as follows: Plumbing Products segment $69 million related to a North American manufacturer of plumbing related products; and Other Specialty Products segment $108 million related to a European manufacturer of heating products. The Company reviews its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. The Company considers the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term. In 2007, the Company recognized a non cash, pre tax impairment charge for other indefinite lived intangible assets of $50 million ($31 million, after tax) in the Other Specialty Products segment related to the value of a registered trademark. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Stock Based Compensation The Companys 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan) replaced the 1991 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the 1991 Plan) in May 2005 and provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms. At December 31, 2007, outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of long term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights. Additionally, the Companys 1997 Non Employee Directors Stock Plan (the 1997 Plan) provides for the payment of part of the compensation to non employee Directors in Company common stock. The 1997 Plan expired in May 2007; subsequently, compensation to non employee Directors in Company common stock will be made from the 2005 Plan. The Company elected to begin recording expense for stock options granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2003. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R) using the Modified Prospective Application (MPA) method. The MPA method requires the Company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through the remaining vesting periods. The MPA method did not require the restatement of prior year information. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the Company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options as of the date of adoption. Long Term Stock Awards Long term stock awards are granted to key employees and non employee Directors of the Company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the Company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market. There was $175 million (9 million common shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at December 31, 2007, which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings. Effective January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years (except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 19 Table of Contents 10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will become, retirement eligible during the vesting period, the expense is being recognized over five years, or immediately upon a grantees retirement. Pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was $52 million for 2007. Stock Options Stock options are granted to key employees and non employee Directors of the Company. The exercise price equals the market price of the Companys common stock at the grant date. These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date. The 2005 Plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options, except for restoration options resulting from options granted under the 1991 Plan. Restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the date of grant. The Company measures compensation expense for stock options using a Black Scholes option pricing model. For stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years. Pre tax compensation expense for stock options was $49 million for 2007. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2007: risk free interest rate 4.74%, dividend yield 3.0%, volatility factor 31.8% and expected option life 7 years. For SFAS No. 123R calculation purposes, the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares, including restoration options, granted in 2007 was $8.92 per option share. If the Company increased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2007 would increase 48 percent. If the Company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2007 would decrease 59 percent. Employee Retirement Plans Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the Companys consolidated financial statements in any given period. In 2007, the Company increased its discount rate for obligations to an average of 6.25 percent from 5.50 percent. The discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plans liabilities matched to the December 31, 2007 Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. Such rates for the Companys defined benefit pension plans ranged from 5.00 percent to 6.50 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 6.25 percent or higher. The assumed asset return was primarily 8.25 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. The Companys net underfunded amount for its qualified defined benefit pension plans, the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to $114 million at December 31, 2007 from $186 million at December 31, 2006, primarily due to asset returns and funding 20 Table of Contents contributions; in accordance with SFAS No. 158, the underfunded amount has been recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2007 had a net return of approximately seven percent compared to average returns of six percent for the largest 1,000 Plan Benchmark. The Companys projected benefit obligation for its unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was $138 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $144 million at December 31, 2006; in accordance with SFAS No. 158, the unfunded amount has been recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans to be $13 million in 2008 compared with $17 million in 2007. If the Company assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return, the 2008 pension expense would increase by $3 million. The Company expects pension expense for its non qualified defined benefit pension plans to decrease by $1 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Income Taxes The Company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets related to its foreign tax credit carryforward of $45 million at December 31, 2007. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Historically, the Company established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5). Under this standard, reserves for tax contingencies were established when it was probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The adoption of FIN No. 48 was effective January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 establishes a lower threshold than SFAS No. 5 for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions (referred to by FIN No. 48 as unrecognized tax benefits). Therefore, the Company believes that there is a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with SFAS No. 5. While the Company believes it has adequately provided for its uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, additional provisions for tax related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Other Commitments and Contingencies Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. 21 Table of Contents A significant portion of the Companys business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Companys revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under SFAS No. 5, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. See Note T to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings involving the Company. Corporate Development Strategy In past years, acquisitions have enabled the Company to build strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the Companys importance to its customers. The Companys focus includes the rationalization of its business units, including consolidations, as well as pursuing synergies among the Companys business units. The Company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on organic growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital. As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to the Companys long term growth strategy. During 2007, the Company completed the sale of a European business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment. In 2006, the Company completed the sale of a North American business unit in the Other Specialty Products segment. These dispositions were completed pursuant to the Companys determination that these business units were not core to the Companys long term growth strategy. The Company recognized a net loss of $10 million in 2007, primarily related to the 2007 discontinued operation. The Company recognized a net gain of $50 million in 2006, primarily related to the 2006 discontinued operation. During 2005, in separate transactions, the Company completed the sale of three business units in Europe, including two in the Cabinets and Related Products segment and one in the Other Specialty Products segment, as well as one business unit in North America in the Cabinets and Related Products segment. The Company recognized a net gain of $63 million in 2005, primarily related to the 2005 discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company accounted for the business units which were sold in 2007, 2006 and 2005, except as noted below, as discontinued operations. There were no businesses held for sale at December 31, 2007. The sales, results of operations and the (losses) gains from the 2007, 2006 and 2005 discontinued operations were included in (loss) income from discontinued operations, net, in the consolidated statements of income. During 2007 and 2006, the Company completed the sale of several small businesses, primarily in the Plumbing Products segment, the results of which were included in continuing operations through the dates of sale. The Company received cash proceeds of $10 million and $72 million, respectively, and recognized a pre tax net (loss) gain of $(8) million and $1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, included in other, net, in continuing operations, related to the 2007 and 2006 sales of business units. During 2007, the Company acquired several relatively small installation service businesses (Installation and Other Services segment), as well as Erickson Construction Company and Guy Evans, Inc. 22 Table of Contents (Installation and Other Services segment). Erickson Construction Company, headquartered in Arizona, provides pre fabricated wall panels and millwork for residential builders in Arizona, California and Nevada. Guy Evans, Inc., headquartered in California, is an installer of millwork, doors, windows and bath hardware for residential builders in California and Nevada. These two acquisitions allow the Company to expand the products and services it offers to its installation customers, and had combined annual sales in 2006 of approximately $200 million. The results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statement from the respective dates of acquisition. The aggregate net purchase price for all of these acquisitions was $202 million and included cash of $195 million and assumed debt of $7 million. During 2006 and 2005, the Company acquired several relatively small businesses (primarily in the Installation and Other Services segment). The results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations, long term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had a $2.0 billion 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks syndicated in the United States and internationally which expires in February 2011. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros with interest payable based upon various floating rate options as selected by the Company. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007. The 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2007, the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $1.9 billion. The 5 Year Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2007, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by $895 million. The Company had cash and cash investments of $922 million at December 31, 2007 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations. The Company has maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, principally as part of its tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital losses. The Company determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous to the Company and complement the Companys investment in more liquid available for sale and marketable securities to balance risk. Since the Company has significantly reduced tax capital losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources, the Company has and will continue to reduce its investments in financial assets. In 2007, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend five percent to $.23 per common share. This marks the 49th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to 50 percent at December 31, 2007 from 53 percent at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the Companys debt to total capitalization percent is primarily due to the repurchase of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes in January 2007. On January 20, 2007, holders of $1.8 billion (94 percent) principal amount at maturity of the Companys Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes (Notes) required the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash value of $825 million. At December 31, 2007, there were outstanding $108 million principal amount at maturity of such Notes, with an accreted value of $52 million, which has been 23 Table of Contents included in long term debt, as the next put option date is July 20, 2011. The Company may at any time redeem all or part of the Notes at their then accreted value. During 2007, the Company also retired $300 million of floating rate notes due March 9, 2007 and $300 million of 4.625% notes due August 15, 2007. On March 14, 2007, the Company issued $300 million of floating rate notes due 2010; the interest rate is determined based upon the three month LIBOR plus 30 basis points. On March 14, 2007, the Company also issued $300 million of fixed rate 5.85% notes due 2017. These debt issuances provided net proceeds of $596 million and were in consideration of the March and August 2007 debt maturities. The Companys working capital ratio was 2.0 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The improvement in the Companys working capital ratio is primarily due to the January 2007 payment of $825 million to repurchase the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes which were included in short term notes payable at December 31, 2006. The derivatives used by the Company during 2007 consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2004, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. Generally, under interest rate swap agreements, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges, and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement. For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings. The average variable interest rates are based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus fixed adjustment factors. The average effective rate for 2007 on the interest rate swaps was 6.264%. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of $850 million of the Companys fixed rate debt due July 15, 2012 with an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In 2007, the Company recognized an increase in interest expense of $3 million related to this swap agreement, due to increasing interest rates. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the European euro, the Great Britain pound and the U.S. dollar. 24 Table of Contents Cash Flows Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions: 2007 2006 2005 Net cash from operating activities $ 1,270 $ 1,208 $ 1,374 (Decrease) increase in debt, net (881 ) 151 407 Proceeds from disposition of: Businesses, net of cash disposed 45 160 278 Property and equipment 45 16 37 Proceeds from financial investments, net 108 165 99 Issuance of Company common stock 60 28 33 Tax benefit from stock based compensation 19 18 Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (203 ) (28 ) (25 ) Capital expenditures (248 ) (388 ) (282 ) Cash dividends paid (347 ) (349 ) (339 ) Purchase of Company common stock (857 ) (854 ) (986 ) Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash investments 47 18 (5 ) Other, net (94 ) (57 ) (15 ) Cash (decrease) increase $ (1,036 ) $ 88 $ 576 The Companys cash and cash investments decreased $1.0 billion to $922 million at December 31, 2007, from $1,958 million at December 31, 2006. Net cash provided by operations of $1.3 billion consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $248 million, net loss on disposition of businesses of $18 million, net gain on disposition of financial investments of $41 million, a $227 million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, a $22 million charge for the impairment of financial investments and other non cash items, including stock based compensation expense, amortization expense related to in store displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as well as a net decrease in working capital of $283 million. The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management, including working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales in accounts receivable were 49 days at December 31, 2007 compared with 50 days at December 31, 2006, and days sales in inventories were 48 days at December 31, 2007 compared with 49 days at December 31, 2006. Accounts payable days improved to 43 days from 40 days at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a percent of sales was 15.4 percent and 16.1 percent at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash used for financing activities was $2.0 billion, and included cash outflows of $347 million for cash dividends paid, $1,425 million for the retirement of notes and $857 million for the acquisition and retirement of 31 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions. Cash provided by financing activities primarily included $596 million from the issuance of notes (net of issuance costs) and $60 million from the issuance of Company common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2007, the Company had remaining Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to an additional 41 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. In January 2008, the Company repurchased an additional three million shares of Company common stock and expects to continue its share repurchase program throughout 2008. 25 Table of Contents Net cash used for investing activities was $347 million, and included $248 million for capital expenditures and $203 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing activities included primarily $45 million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses and $108 million from the net sale of financial investments. The Company invests in automating its manufacturing operations to increase its productivity to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2007 were $248 million, compared with $388 million for 2006 and $282 million for 2005; for 2008, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2008 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $240 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2007 totaled $248 million, compared with $244 million for 2006 and $241 million for 2005; for 2008, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2008 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $260 million. Amortization expense totaled $20 million, $14 million and $28 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor, in the opinion of the Company, are they expected to have, a material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales. Consolidated Results of Operations The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. However, the Company believes that certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results. Sales and Operations Net sales for 2007 were $11.8 billion, representing a decrease of seven percent from 2006. Excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales decreased 11 percent compared with 2006. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions: Twelve Months Ended December 31 2007 2006 Net sales, as reported $ 11,770 $ 12,718 Acquisitions (175 ) Net sales, excluding acquisitions 11,595 12,718 Currency translation (207 ) Net sales, excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency $ 11,388 $ 12,718 Net sales for 2007 were adversely affected by a continued decline in the new home construction market, which reduced sales volume, and contributed to a nine percent decline in net sales. Economic conditions remain difficult in the new home construction market. Full year housing starts have declined from 2.1 million in 2005 to 1.3 million in 2007. Net sales for 2007 were also negatively affected by a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products, which contributed to lower sales volume, reducing net sales by two percent compared to 2006. Retail sales volume benefited from increased sales volume of paints and stains and International plumbing products. 26 Table of Contents The Companys gross profit margins were 27.3 percent, 27.6 percent and 28.5 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the 2007 gross profit margin reflects lower sales volume of certain products, which more than offset the benefits associated with the Companys business rationalizations and other initiatives. The decrease in the 2006 gross profit margins reflects increased commodity, energy and freight costs, as well as a less favorable product mix, offset in part by increased selling prices for certain products. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 17.2 percent in 2007 compared with 16.1 percent in 2006 and 15.5 percent in 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2007 reflect lower sales volume, as well as increased advertising costs of 2.9 percent of sales compared to 2.6 percent of sales in 2006. The year 2007 also includes increased severance costs of $16 million, increased bad debt expense of $13 million and increased systems implementation costs of $7 million, which, on a combined basis, increased .3 percent of sales compared to 2006. Increased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006, compared to 2005, reflect increased stock based compensation expense of .8 percent of sales compared to .6 percent of sales in 2005, in part reflecting the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and increased information systems implementation costs and other expenses. Operating profit in 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes $79 million, $47 million and $12 million, respectively, of costs and charges related to the Companys business rationalizations and other initiatives. Operating profit in 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes $227 million, $317 million and $43 million, respectively, of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets. Operating profit in 2006 and 2005 includes $1 million and $6 million, respectively, of income regarding the Behr litigation settlement. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 8.1 percent, 9.0 percent and 12.7 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding the items above, were 10.7 percent, 11.8 percent and 13.1 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2007 were adversely affected by a continuing decline in new home construction and a moderation in consumer spending in North America, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of installation and other services, assembled cabinets and windows and doors; such sales volume declines negatively impacted operating profit margin by 1.6 percentage points compared to 2006. Operating profit margins benefited from the Companys business rationalizations and other initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain big ticket home improvement items, such as cabinets, in the last half of 2006, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products and reduced operating profit margin by approximately one percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating profit margins in 2006 were also affected by the continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs partially offset by certain selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2005 were impacted by increased commodity, energy and freight costs, which had only been partially offset by selling price increases. Other Income (Expense), Net During 2007, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $22 million related to financial investments in Furniture Brands International common stock ($6 million), Asahi Tec common stock ($3 million), auction rate securities ($3 million) and private equity funds ($10 million). Other, net, for 2007 included $5 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $6 million of dividend income and $38 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2007 also included $9 million of realized currency gains and other miscellaneous items. During 2006, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $101 million for its investments related to Metaldyne ($40 million), TriMas ($16 million), the Heartland fund ($29 million) and other funds ($16 million). 27 Table of Contents Other, net, for 2006 included $4 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $10 million of dividend income and $30 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2006 also included realized currency gains of $14 million and other miscellaneous items. During 2005, the Company recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $45 million primarily related to its investment in Furniture Brands International common stock ($30 million) and private equity funds ($15 million). Other, net, for 2005 included $30 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $16 million of dividend income and $69 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2005 also included realized currency losses of $25 million and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense was $258 million, $240 million and $247 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2007 is primarily due to increasing interest rates and the issuance of higher interest rate debt of 6.125% notes in October 2006 and floating rate notes and 5.85% notes in March 2007. These debt issuances were in consideration of the 2007 debt payments. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily the result of the repayment of $800 million of 6.75% notes in March 2006, partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion of 6.125% notes in October 2006, as well as the impact of increasing interest rates. Income and Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2007 were $397 million and $1.06 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2007 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of $227 million ($208 million or $.56 per common share, after tax). Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2006 were $478 million and $1.20 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2006 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $317 million ($317 million or $.79 per common share, after tax). Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2005 were $889 million and $2.07 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2005 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $43 million ($43 million or $.10 per common share, after tax) and income regarding the litigation settlement of $6 million pre tax ($4 million or $.01 per common share, after tax). The Companys effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 44 percent, 45 percent, and 36 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increased tax rates in 2007 and 2006 are primarily due to the impairment charges for goodwill not being deductible for tax purposes. The Companys effective tax rate for income from continuing operations, excluding the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets, was 36 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 42 to 43 percent in 2008. The expected tax rate for 2008 is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the U.S. tax on anticipated dividend distributions from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are taxed at rates less than the U.S. Federal rate of 35 percent. These dividends are being distributed to utilize certain favorable provisions of the U.S. income tax law that are scheduled to expire at December 31, 2008. The majority of the U.S. tax currently payable on these dividends will be offset by the Companys $45 million foreign tax credit carryforward; such utilization of the foreign tax credit carryforward will be accounted for as a reversal of the $45 million deferred tax asset. 28 Table of Contents Outlook for the Company Economic conditions remain difficult in a number of the Companys markets. Housing starts declined 25 percent in 2007 due to excessive inventories of homes and less attractive mortgage terms. As a result, full year 2007 housing starts declined to 1.3 million from 2.1 million in 2005 and the Company expects a further decline in housing starts in 2008. In addition, the Company anticipates a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products and, notwithstanding recent actions by the Federal Reserve and the government to stimulate economic growth, the Company believes that 2008 will be a difficult year for the overall U.S. economy. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company also experienced a softening of demand for certain of its International products due to declining European economies. The Company expects market conditions in its industry, in the next several quarters, to be very challenging. The Company is confident of its strategy of dividend increases and share repurchases while concentrating on organic growth, improving returns and generating superior cash flow. The Companys strategy, together with the leveraging of the combined market strength of its retail service, distribution and installation capabilities, brands and scale, should allow Masco to continue to drive long term growth and value for its shareholders. 29 Table of Contents Business Segment and Geographic Area Results The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

The 2006 impairment charges for goodwill were as follows: Cabinets and Related Products $316 million; and Plumbing Products $1 million. The 2005 impairment charges for goodwill were as follows: Plumbing Products $7 million; and Other Specialty Products $36 million. 30 Table of Contents Business Segment Results Discussion Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate expense, net, gains on sale of corporate fixed assets, net, income regarding the litigation settlement, and impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Business Rationalizations and Other Initiatives Over the past several years, the Company has been focused on the rationalization of its businesses, including sourcing programs, business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, plant start ups, systems implementations and other initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company incurred net costs and charges of $79 million related to these initiatives, net of an $8 million gain from the sale of fixed assets. During 2006, the Company incurred $39 million pre tax of costs and charges (primarily accelerated depreciation and severance expense) related to a plant closure and other profit improvement programs in the Plumbing Products segment. In addition, in 2006, the Company incurred $8 million pre tax of costs and charges (including the write down of inventories and accelerated depreciation) related to the closure of a relatively small ready to assemble cabinet manufacturing facility in the Cabinets and Related Products segment. In 2005, the Company also incurred approximately $12 million pre tax of charges related to headcount reductions and the discontinuance of a product line in the Plumbing Products segment. Cabinets and Related Products Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2007 primarily due to a decline in sales volume of assembled cabinets in the new home construction market, which reduced sales in this segment by 11 percent compared to 2006. A decline in net sales of ready to assemble cabinets reduced sales in this segment by five percent in 2007 compared to 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment and increased sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales in this segment decreased in 2006 primarily due to lower sales of ready to assemble cabinets in North America and Europe, which more than offset certain selling price increases and sales volume increases of assembled cabinets in North America in the first half of 2006. Net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales volume in the new construction market, as well as certain selling price increases. Operating profit margins in the Cabinets and Related Products segment were negatively affected by the decline in sales volume in 2007, which reduced operating profit margin by three percentage points, as well as increased start up costs and the under utilization of two new plants in this segment, and increased severance costs. Such declines were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility of $8 million and benefits associated with business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006, operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume in the last half of the year, as well as increased commodity, freight and plant start up costs and lower results of European operations, offset in part by selling price increases. In 2006, operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by $8 million of costs and charges related to the closure of a relatively small ready to assemble cabinet manufacturing facility. Operating profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight costs and manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies in North America, as well as a shift to a less favorable product mix, which offset the positive impact of higher unit sales volume. Plumbing Products Net sales of Plumbing Products increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of certain European operations, which increased sales in this segment by three percent in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2007, increased selling prices also increased sales in this segment by three percent compared to 31 Table of Contents 2006. These results were partially offset by declining sales volume to North American retail and wholesale customers, which reduced sales in this segment by four percent in 2007 compared to 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar also had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment and increased sales by four percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and increased sales by one percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales through the Companys wholesale distribution channel and the increased sales of certain European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins in the Plumbing Products segment in 2007 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs in early 2007, which reduced operating profit margin by 1.7 percentage points compared to 2006. Such declines were partially offset by selling price increases and the reduction of certain variable expenses. Operating profit margins in this segment were adversely affected by costs and charges aggregating $39 million and $12 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to certain profit improvement initiatives; excluding such charges, operating profit margins in this segment would have been 9.7 percent and 12.2 percent in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by increased commodity costs, as well as a less favorable product mix and declining sales volume to certain retail customers. Operating profit margins in 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs, which were not offset by selling price increases and a less favorable product mix, which more than offset increased sales volume in the wholesale distribution channel. The Companys Plumbing Products segment continues to be negatively impacted by import competition, as well as a product mix shift towards lower margin faucets within the North American retail channels. As part of the Companys strategic review of its businesses, the Company determined that in order to remain competitive, it is necessary to increase off shore sourcing at lower costs, while consolidating and reducing manufacturing operations in North America. Consistent with this determination, in 2006, the Company closed a North American plant in this segment. Installation and Other Services Net sales of Installation and Other Services decreased in 2007 primarily due to lower sales volume related to the continued slowdown in the new home construction market, which reduced sales in this segment by 20 percent compared to 2006 and declines in selling prices, partially offset by acquisitions which increased sales in this segment by six percent compared to 2006. Net sales in this segment increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of non insulation products and selling price increases in the first half of 2006. However, the slowdown in the new home construction market significantly reduced sales in the second half of 2006 compared to 2005. Net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased selling prices, as well as increased sales volume of non insulation products and strength in the new home construction market. Operating profit margins in the Installation and Other Services segment were lower in 2007 primarily due to lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs, which decreased operating profit margin in this segment by approximately three percentage points compared to 2006, and lower selling prices. The year 2007 also included increased bad debt expense, increased severance and location closure costs and increased systems implementation expenses, which, on a combined basis, reduced operating profit margin in this segment by one percentage point compared to 2006. Partially offsetting these declines were reductions in material costs, as well as benefits associated with the business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006, the operating profit margin decline in this segment was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of generally lower margin, non insulation products, as well as increased operating costs to support the segments growth in non insulation products, new product development and technology initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2005 were affected by increases in sales of generally lower margin, non insulation products, as well as the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to material cost increases, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volume. 32 Table of Contents Decorative Architectural Products Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2007 primarily due to higher retail sales volume from new product introductions of paints and stains, which increased sales in this segment by four percent compared to 2006, which was partially offset by sales declines related to builders hardware. Net sales in this segment increased in 2006 primarily due to selling price increases of paints and stains. Net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains. Operating profit margins in the Decorative Architectural Products segment in 2007 primarily reflect increased sales volume of paints and stains, offset by increased advertising expenses. In 2006, operating profit margins in this segment improved due to increased selling prices of paints and stains, which partially offset commodity cost increases experienced in late 2004 and during 2005. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were impacted by increased material and freight costs, which were not completely offset by increased selling prices related to paints and stains. Other Specialty Products Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased principally due to lower sales volume of windows and doors, primarily resulting from the continued slowdown in the new home construction market, particularly in the Western United States, which decreased sales in this segment by 14 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and four percent in 2006 compared to 2005. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment and increased sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales volume and certain selling price increases of windows and doors to the North American new home construction market, partially offset by reduced sales of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins in the Other Specialty Products segment declined in 2007 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors in the new home construction market, which decreased operating profit margin by 3.2 percentage points compared to 2006, and lower results of European operations, which reduced operating profit by 1.6 percentage points compared to 2006. Operating profit margins in this segment declined in 2006 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors, which offset improved European operating results. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs and the lower results of European operations, reflecting charges related to profit improvement initiatives, offset in part by reduced state use tax expense. Geographic Area Results Discussion North America Net sales from North American operations decreased in 2007 primarily due to the continued decline in the new home construction market, which declined 25 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products. North American sales in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services, assembled cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market which decreased sales from North American operations by 11 percent compared to 2006. In addition, North American net sales were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of certain products, partially offset by increased retail sales volume of paint and stains, which aggregated a net decrease to sales from North American operations of one percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Net sales from North American operations increased slightly in 2006 benefiting from relatively stronger market conditions in the first half of 2006, as well as increased selling prices. An accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending reduced sales volume in the second half of 2006 particularly for assembled cabinets, windows and doors and sales of insulation products. Net sales from North American operations in 2005 were affected by the strength in the new home construction market and increased sales volume of cabinets, installation sales of insulation and non insulation products, and sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors, as well as increased selling prices for certain products. 33 Table of Contents In North America, the Company manufactures products (principally windows, doors and cabinets) and provides installation of insulation and other services to homebuilders. The Company has relationships with 90 of the top 100 builders in the United States. The Company has seen an increase in bad debt expense, related to homebuilders, from $7 million in 2006 to $22 million in 2007. The Company monitors its customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis. Currently, the top ten U.S. homebuilders represent less than three percent of the Companys consolidated receivable balance of $1.4 billion. The decline in operating profit margin from North American operations in 2007 is primarily due to declines in new home construction and consumer spending, which negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products, and decreased operating profit margin by two percentage points compared to 2006. The declines in 2007 were partially offset by selling price increases, and the benefits associated with the Companys business rationalizations and other initiatives. In 2006, the operating profit margins declined from North American operations due to sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of ready to assemble cabinets, windows and doors and the installation of insulation products. Operating profit margins in 2006 were also negatively affected by increased commodity costs, partially offset by selling price increases. Operating profit margins in 2005 were impacted by continued increases in commodity, energy, freight and other petroleum based product costs, which were only partially offset by selling price increases, and increased sales volume of cabinets, installation services and windows and patio doors to the new home construction market. International, Principally Europe Net sales from International operations increased in 2007 primarily due to increased sales volume of plumbing products which increased sales from International operations in local currencies by five percent compared to 2006. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of International results in 2007, increasing International net sales by ten percent compared to 2006. Net sales from International operations increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales of plumbing products, which increased sales from International operations in local currencies by six percent compared to 2005. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of European results, increasing European net sales by one percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Net sales from International operations in 2005 were affected by the increased local currency sales of exported plumbing products and ready to assemble cabinets, offset in part by declining sales of windows and other plumbing products. Operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix and material cost increases. Operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the lower operating results for European ready to assemble cabinets, which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of other European operations. Operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and costs associated with certain profit improvement initiatives, as well as a less favorable product mix. 34 Table of Contents Other Matters Commitments and Contingencies Litigation Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is set forth in Note T to the consolidated financial statements. Other Commitments With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company had, at December 31, 2007, commitments to contribute up to $49 million of additional capital to such funds, representing the Companys aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. The Company is contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to its private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. The Company has no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of the Companys investment in the private equity fund when paid. The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the Companys products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides payment obligations related to current contracts at December 31, 2007, in millions: Payments Due by Period Less than 2 3 4 5 More than 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Other (D) Total Debt (A) $ 122 $ 314 $ 926 $ 2,726 $ $ 4,088 Interest (A) 240 456 411 1,175 2,282 Operating leases 110 125 57 59 351 Currently payable income taxes 23 23 Defined benefit plans 22 27 29 80 158 Private equity funds (B) 16 16 17 49 Acquisition related commitments 3 6 1 10 Post retirement obligations 1 1 1 4 7 Purchase commitments (C) 237 82 319 Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties (D) 95 95 Total $ 774 $ 1,027 $ 1,442 $ 4,044 $ 95 $ 7,382 (A) The Company assumed that all debt would be held to maturity, except for the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, which would be held until the next put option date of July 20, 2011. (B) There is no schedule for the capital commitments to the private equity funds; such allocation was estimated by the Company. (C) Excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and open or pending purchase orders. (D) Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with unrecognized tax benefits, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the period beyond the next year in which cash settlements may occur with applicable tax authorities. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is effective January 1, 2009 for non financial assets and liabilities, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact these provisions will have on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of SFAS No. 115, (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is optional and is effective January 1, 2008. The Company has elected not to adopt SFAS No. 159. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R requires that the acquisition method be applied to all business combinations and it establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities by the 36 Table of Contents acquiring company. Further, it requires that costs incurred to complete any acquisition be recognized as expense in the consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 141R also requires that contingent assets and liabilities be recorded at fair value and marked to market quarterly until they are settled, with any changes to the fair value to be recorded as income or expense in the consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for any business combinations that are completed subsequent to January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the provisions of SFAS No. 141R will have on its consolidated financial statements and its method of accounting for business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of shareholders equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. SFAS No. 160 is effective January 1, 2009, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments. The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to its marketable securities and other investments. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments. The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2007 consist of interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The Company, including certain European operations, also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the European euro, the Great Britain pound and the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2007, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 37 Table of Contents
