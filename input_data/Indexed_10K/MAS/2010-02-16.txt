Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report, the Executive Level Overview, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Outlook for the Company sections, may affect our performance. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Executive Level Overview We manufacture, distribute and install home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, homebuilders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. During 2009, we experienced a decline in our markets, including a decline in new home construction of over 38 percent from 2008, as well as a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products. Net sales decreased 18 percent in 2009 from 2008, and operating profit (as adjusted to exclude impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets, general corporate expense, net, charge for defined benefit plan curtailment, charge for litigation settlements, accelerated stock compensation expense and (loss) gain on corporate fixed assets, net see Footnote O of the consolidated financial statements) declined to 6.2 percent of sales in 2009 from 7.5 percent of sales in 2008. Factors that affect our results of operations include the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction principally in North America and Europe, the importance of our relationships with key customers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2009), our ability to maintain our leadership positions in our U.S. and global markets in the face of increasing competition and our ability to effectively manage our overall cost structure, including the cost and availability of materials. Our International businesses face political, monetary, economic and other risks that vary from country to country, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Further, we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk. In addition, litigation could be costly. These and other factors are discussed in more detail in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 17 Table of Contents We believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition and Receivables We recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. We record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the Installation and Other Services segment; such amounts are recorded in Receivables. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. In addition, we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on going basis. During downturns in our markets, declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults. Our bad debt expense was $34 million, $41 million and $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In North America, we manufacture products (principally windows, doors and cabinets) and provide installation of insulation and other products and services to homebuilders. Our bad debt expense related to homebuilders was $22 million, $28 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Inventories We record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. Financial Investments On January 1, 2008, we adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Further, it defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and disclosure of the fair value for financial instruments, as follows: Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. We have maintained investments in available for sale securities and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $110 million and $123 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. We record investments in available for sale securities at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recognized, net of tax effect, through shareholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet. We estimated the fair value of investments in available for sale securities using primarily Level 1 inputs. We estimated the fair value of our investment in Asahi Tec preferred stock using a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). If we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 100 basis points, the value of the Asahi Tec preferred stock would change by approximately three percent. 18 Table of Contents In the past, we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7, 28 or 35 days. At December 31, 2009, our investment in auction rate securities was $22 million; we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model (Level 3 input). If we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points, the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately $1 million. We carry our investments in private equity funds at cost. It is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds because there are no quoted market prices, and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund. These investments are evaluated, on a non recurring basis, for potential other than temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present, or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred, that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Due to the significant unobservable inputs, the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a Level 3 input. Impairment indicators we consider include the following: whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance, asset quality or business prospects; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment; a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates; industry and sector performance; current equity and credit market conditions; and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund, including industry and sector performance. The significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential other than temporary impairment include current economic conditions, market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive and transportation, residential and commercial construction, bio technology, health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds investments operate. At December 31, 2009, we have investments in 17 venture capital funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $28 million. The venture capital funds invest in start up or smaller, early stage established businesses, principally in the information technology, bio technology and health care sectors. At December 31, 2009, we also have investments in 28 buyout funds, with an aggregate carrying value of $95 million. The buyout funds invest in later stage, established businesses and, other than the Heartland Industrial Partners Fund, which is primarily in the automotive and transportation sector, no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector. Since there is no active trading market for these investments, they are for the most part illiquid. These investments, by their nature, can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk, including financial leverage, than other financial investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments, as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Future changes in market conditions, the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. We record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary. During 2009, we recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges of $10 million related to our investment in five private equity funds. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. We selected the discounted cash flow methodology as we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of 19 Table of Contents goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by accounting guidance. Our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities, for which discrete financial information, including five year forecasts, are available. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. In 2009, for our reporting units that primarily sell to the new home construction market (including those in the Installation and Other Services segment), we utilized estimated housing starts, from independent industry sources, growing from current levels to 1.6 million units in 2014 (terminal growth year) and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical margins for those business units by 2014 (terminal growth year). We generally utilize our weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) of approximately nine percent to discount the estimated cash flows. However, in 2009 and 2008, due to market conditions, we increased the discount rate for most of our reporting units, based upon a review of the current risks impacting our businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. In 2009, we recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill aggregating $262 million ($180 million, after tax). The pre tax impairment charge of $39 million relates to our European shower enclosure manufacturer and reflects a decline in the reporting units anticipated long term outlook. The pre tax impairment charge of $223 million relates to our manufacturer of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools and reflects a decline in the reporting units anticipated long term outlook. A five percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in a Step Two Analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the Installation and Other Services segment. A ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in a Step Two Analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the Cabinets and Related Products segment, one reporting unit in the Installation and Other Services segment and one reporting unit in the Other Specialty Products segment. We review our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each 20 Table of Contents reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Stock Based Compensation Our 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan) provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms to employees and non employee Directors. At December 31, 2009, outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of long term stock awards, stock options, phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights. Long Term Stock Awards We grant long term stock awards to key employees and non employee Directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market. We measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date. There was $126 million (nine million common shares) of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at December 31, 2009, which was included as a reduction of common stock and paid in capital. Effective January 1, 2006, we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 5 to 10 years (except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older, which vest over five years), or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age 65. For stock awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards, typically 10 years, or for executive grantees that are, or will become, retirement eligible during the vesting period, we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantees retirement. Pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was $37 million for 2009. Stock Options We grant stock options to key employees and non employee Directors. The exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date. These options generally become exercisable (vest ratably) over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date. We measure compensation expense for stock options using a Black Scholes option pricing model. For stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years, or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age 65. The expense for unvested stock options at January 1, 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the stock options, typically five years. Pre tax compensation expense for stock options was $25 million for 2009. We estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2009: risk free interest rate 2.60%, dividend yield 3.70%, volatility factor 39.18% and expected option life 6 years. For expense calculation purposes, the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in 2009 was $2.28 per option share. If we increased our assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 would increase by 53 percent. If we decreased our assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent, the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 would decrease by 61 percent. Employee Retirement Plans Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each 21 Table of Contents employee works. We develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements. In March 2009, based on managements recommendation, the Board of Directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans. The freeze was effective January 1, 2010. As a result of this action, the liabilities for the plans impacted by the freeze were remeasured and we recognized a curtailment charge of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009. In December 2009, we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 5.80 percent from 6.10 percent. The discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plans liabilities matched to the December 31, 2009 Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The discount rates we use for our defined benefit pension plans ranged from 2.60 percent to 6.25 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 5.60 percent or higher. The assumed asset return was primarily 8.00 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. Our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, decreased to $332 million at December 31, 2009 from $344 million at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the decision to freeze all future benefit accruals; in accordance with accounting guidance, the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2009 had a net gain of approximately 22 percent compared to average gains of 21 percent for the corporate funds universe within the Independent Consultant Cooperative. Our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was $152 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $147 million at December 31, 2008; such unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We expect pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be $33 million in 2010 compared with $40 million in 2009. If we assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points, the 2010 pension expense would increase by $4 million. We expect pension expense for our non qualified defined benefit pension plans to be $8 million in 2010 compared with $15 million in 2009. We have several funding options and credits available and we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately $20 million to $25 million in 2010 to our qualified defined benefit plans. Income Taxes We have considered potential sources of future taxable income in determining the amount of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Of the $582 million of deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2009 net of the valuation allowance, $432 million is anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, and $150 million is anticipated to be realized through future gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies, including the potential sale of certain operating assets and through capital gains in the carryback period. The continued utilization of our tax planning strategies is largely dependent upon the future performance of certain businesses. A significant decline in the expectation of future performance may impact our valuation allowance assessment. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. The need 22 Table of Contents to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate. Effective January 1, 2007, the FASB issued new guidance which allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. This new guidance establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions (referred to as unrecognized tax benefits). Therefore, we believe that there is a greater potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with prior guidance. While we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Accordingly, additional provisions for tax related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Other Commitments and Contingencies Certain of our products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. Our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that we experience any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. The majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. Our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and we record deductions at the time of sale. We are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. When estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments. See Note S to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings. Corporate Development Strategy Our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units, including consolidations, and increasing synergies among our business units. Going forward, we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow, organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development, start up businesses related to home energy services and greenfield locations related to certain Installation and Other Services businesses. As part of our strategic planning, we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long term growth strategy. During 2009, we sold two European business units in the Plumbing Products segment that were not core to our long term growth strategy. We recognized a net pre tax loss of $43 million in 2009 related to these transactions. We accounted for the business units which were sold in 2009, 2008 and 2007, as discontinued operations. See Note B to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 23 Table of Contents During 2009, we acquired a small business in the Plumbing Products segment; this business allows us to expand into a developing market and had annual sales of $11 million, for a net purchase price of $6 million in cash. During 2008, we acquired a relatively small countertop business (Cabinet and Related Products segment). This business, which allows us to expand products and services we offer to our customers, had annual sales of over $40 million. During 2007, we acquired several relatively small installation service businesses (Installation and Other Services segment), as well as Erickson Construction Company and Guy Evans, Inc. (Installation and Other Services segment). The results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by a combination of our operations, long term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies; such strategies have led to cash of over $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. Our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 58 percent and 57 percent at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At our request, in late April 2009, our Bank Group modified the terms of our Five Year Revolving Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2011. After reviewing our anticipated liquidity position, we requested that the maximum amount we could borrow under this facility be reduced to $1.25 billion from $2.0 billion; in addition, the debt to total capitalization ratio requirement has been increased from 60 percent to 65 percent. The debt to total capitalization ratio and the minimum net worth covenants have also been amended to allow the add back, if incurred, of up to the first $500 million of certain non cash charges, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges that would negatively impact shareholders equity. We incurred approximately $2 million of fees and expenses associated with the Amendment. If the facility is utilized, we will incur higher borrowing costs as a result of the Amendment. The Amended Five Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2009, our net worth exceeded such requirement by $1.0 billion. Under the terms of the Amended Five Year Revolving Credit Agreement, any outstanding Letters of Credit reduce our borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2009, we had $83 million of unused Letters of Credit. The Amended Five Year Revolving Credit Agreement also contains limitations on additional borrowings, related to the debt to total capitalization requirements; at December 31, 2009, we had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $1.2 billion. In addition, at December 31, 2009, we could absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately $867 million, and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant. In order to borrow under the Amended Five Year Revolving Credit Agreement, there must not be any defaults in our covenants in the credit agreement (i.e., in addition to the two financial covenants, principally limitations on subsidiary debt, negative pledge restrictions, legal compliance requirements and maintenance of insurance) and our representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing (i.e., principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change, in each case since December 31, 2008, no material ERISA or environmental non compliance and no material tax deficiency). We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We had cash and cash investments of over $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts, money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments. 24 Table of Contents We have maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, principally as part of our tax planning strategies, as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses. We determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid available for sale and marketable securities to balance risk. Since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources, we have and will continue to reduce our investments in long term financial assets. During 2009, we announced the reduction of our quarterly dividend to $.075 per common share from $.235 per common share. We have a scheduled maturity of our long term indebtedness in March 2010 when $300 million of our Floating Rate Notes become due. Subsequent to this maturity, we have no scheduled maturities until July 2012 when our $850 million of 5.875% fixed rate notes become due. Our working capital ratio was 1.9 to 1 and 2.1 to 1 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the European euro and the U.S. dollar. Cash Flows Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions: 2009 2008 2007 Net cash from operating activities $ 705 $ 797 $ 1,270 Proceeds from disposition of: Businesses, net of cash disposed 8 179 45 Property and equipment 23 1 45 Proceeds from financial investments, net 11 58 108 Proceeds from settlement of swaps 16 Issuance of Company common stock 60 Tax benefit from stock based compensation 7 3 19 Cash dividends paid (166 ) (336 ) (347 ) Capital expenditures (125 ) (200 ) (248 ) Purchase of Company common stock (11 ) (160 ) (857 ) (Decrease) in debt, net (11 ) (133 ) (881 ) Dividends paid to noncontrolling interest (16 ) (21 ) (14 ) Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (8 ) (21 ) (203 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash investments (5 ) (46 ) 47 Other, net (27 ) (31 ) (80 ) Cash increase (decrease) $ 385 $ 106 $ (1,036 ) Our cash and cash investments increased $385 million to $1,413 million at December 31, 2009, from $1,028 million at December 31, 2008. Net cash provided by operations of $705 million consisted primarily of net (loss) adjusted for non cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $254 million, net loss on disposition of businesses of $40 million, a $262 million charge for the impairment of goodwill, a $10 million charge for the impairment of financial investments and other non cash items, including stock based compensation expense, amortization expense related to in store displays and interest expense on the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes, as well as a net decrease in working capital of $235 million. 25 Table of Contents We continue to emphasize balance sheet management, including working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales in accounts receivable were 48 days at December 31, 2009 compared with 50 days at December 31, 2008, and days sales in inventories were 48 days at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Accounts payable days were 47 days at December 31, 2009 and 43 days at December 31, 2008. Working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) as a percent of sales was 14.7 percent at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Net cash used for financing activities was $197 million, and included cash outflows of $166 million for cash dividends paid, $11 million for the net payment of debt and $11 million for the acquisition of our common stock to offset the dilutive impact of long term stock awards granted in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had remaining Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to an additional 30 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. We believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near term working capital and other investment needs. We believe that our longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities. Consistent with past practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2010 to offset any dilution from long term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs. Net cash used for investing activities was $118 million, and included $125 million for capital expenditures and $8 million for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing activities included primarily $31 million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses and property and equipment and $11 million from the net sale of financial investments. We invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity to improve customer service and to support new product innovation. Capital expenditures for 2009 were $125 million, compared with $200 million for 2008 and $248 million for 2007; for 2010, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2010 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $190 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2009 totaled $254 million, compared with $238 million for 2008 and $248 million for 2007; for 2010, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2010 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $240 million. Amortization expense totaled $17 million, $17 million and $20 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor, in our opinion, are they expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. Consolidated Results of Operations We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. However, we believe that certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results. 26 Table of Contents Sales and Operations Net sales for 2009 were $7.8 billion, representing a decrease of 18 percent from 2008. Excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales decreased 16 percent compared with 2008. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions: Twelve Months Ended December 31 2009 2008 Net sales, as reported $ 7,792 $ 9,484 Acquisitions (9 ) Net sales, excluding acquisitions 7,783 9,484 Currency translation 151 Net sales, excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency $ 7,934 $ 9,484 Net sales for 2009 were adversely affected by declines in the new home construction market, which reduced sales volume by approximately nine percent compared to 2008. Economic conditions remain difficult in the new home construction market as full year 2009 housing starts have declined over 38 percent to 554,000 from 2008. Net sales for 2009 were also negatively affected by declines in consumer spending for home improvement products, which contributed to lower sales volume, reducing net sales by approximately six percent compared to 2008. Such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases for certain products, which increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2008. Net sales volume of our International products declined in local currencies and reduced consolidated net sales by approximately three percent compared to 2008. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two percent compared to 2008. Our gross profit margins were 25.9 percent, 24.9 percent and 27.5 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in the 2009 gross profit margin reflects the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 21.8 percent in 2009 compared with 19.0 percent in 2008 and 17.1 percent in 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 and 2008 reflect lower sales volume, increased advertising expenses related to new product introductions and increased system implementation costs. Operating profit in 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes $94 million, $78 million and $78 million, net, respectively, of costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating profit in 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes $262 million, $467 million and $119 million, respectively, of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets. Operating profit in 2009 and 2008 includes $7 million and $9 million, respectively, of charges for litigation settlements. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 0.7 percent, 0.9 percent and 9.3 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding the items above, were 5.4 percent, 6.8 percent and 11.0 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs and lower selling prices related to the decline in the new home construction market in North America as well as lower sales volume of plumbing products in the North American and International home improvement markets. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains, the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs across our businesses and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2008 were adversely affected by accelerating declines in new home construction and a continued decline in consumer spending in North American and International markets, both of which negatively impacted the 27 Table of Contents sales volume in each of our segments and negatively impacted operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in 2007 were adversely affected by a decline in new home construction and a moderation in consumer spending in North America, both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets and windows and doors. Other Income (Expense), Net During 2009, we recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $10 million for our investments in private equity funds. Other, net, for 2009 included $3 million of income from financial investments, net. Other, net, for 2009 also included realized foreign currency gains of $17 million and other miscellaneous items. During 2008, we recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $58 million primarily related to financial investments in TriMas common stock ($31 million), Asahi Tec common stock ($1 million), private equity funds ($23 million) and other investments ($3 million). Other, net, for 2008 included $3 million of realized losses, net, from the sale of marketable securities and $4 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2008 also included realized foreign currency losses of $29 million and other miscellaneous items. During 2007, we recognized non cash, pre tax impairment charges aggregating $22 million related to financial investments in Furniture Brands International common stock ($6 million), Asahi Tec common stock ($3 million), auction rate securities ($3 million) and private equity funds ($10 million). Other, net, for 2007 included $5 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable securities, $6 million of dividend income and $38 million of income from other investments, net. Other, net, for 2007 also included $9 million of realized foreign currency gains and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense was $225 million, $228 million and $258 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2008 is primarily due to lower interest rates and the retirement of higher fixed rate debt in 2007 and 2008. (Loss) Income and (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share from Continuing Operations (Attributable to Masco Corporation) (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing operations for 2009 were $(140) million and $(.41) per common share, respectively. (Loss) and diluted (loss) per common share from continuing operations for 2008 were $(366) million and $(1.06) per common share, respectively. Income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2007 were $502 million and $1.32 per common share, respectively. (Loss) from continuing operations for 2009 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of $262 million ($180 million or $.51 per common share, after tax). (Loss) from continuing operations for 2008 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of $467 million ($445 million or $1.26 per common share, after tax). Income from continuing operations for 2007 included non cash, pre tax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of $119 million ($100 million or $.27 per common share, after tax). Our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a 33 percent tax benefit in 2009 and a 69 percent tax expense in 2008 and for income from continuing operations was a 39 percent tax expense in 2007. Our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations, excluding the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets, was 30 percent, 57 percent and 36 percent in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent, the lower effective tax rate in 2009 is due primarily to the reversal of an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits related to a withholding tax issue from a formerly held European company due to a recent favorable court decision. The higher effective tax rate in 2008 reflects the additional U.S. tax on a repatriation of low taxed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to utilize a foreign tax credit carryforward, combined with a decrease in our 2008 pre tax income. We expect our tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 37 percent. 28 Table of Contents Outlook for the Company We expect that business conditions in 2010 will improve compared to 2009. While we are concerned about the impact of current unemployment levels, foreclosure activity and access to financing, we believe that housing starts will improve in 2010 and will increase to a range of 600,000 to 700,000 units from 554,000 units in 2009. While we anticipate that expenditures on repair and remodel activity will improve modestly in 2010 from 2009 levels, we believe that big ticket items will continue to be deferred until general economic conditions, credit availability and home prices improve. We are confident that the long term fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets are positive. We believe that our strong financial position, together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands (including: KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets, Behr paint and Milgard windows), our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles, will allow us to drive long term growth and create value for our shareholders. 29 Table of Contents Business Segment and Geographic Area Results The following table sets forth our net sales and operating profit (loss) information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

Business Rationalizations and Other Initiatives Over the past several years, we have been focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions, system implementations and other cost savings initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred net costs and charges of $94 million pre tax related to these initiatives. Based on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate $38 million in 2010. We continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges. In February 2010, we announced the combination of our Builder Cabinet Group and Retail Cabinet Group to form Masco Cabinetry; the additional cost is currently estimated at approximately $30 million to $35 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred net costs and charges of $78 million pre tax related to these initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred net costs and charges of $78 million related to business rationalizations, net of an $8 million gain from the sale of fixed assets. Cabinets and Related Products Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the new home construction and retail markets, as well as a less favorable product mix, which combined to reduce sales in this segment by approximately 24 percent compared to 2008 and 16 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Net sales in this segment were also negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of International operations, which reduced sales in this segment by approximately three percent compared to 2008 and by approximately five percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Such declines were partially offset by increased selling prices, which increased sales by approximately one percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the new home construction market, as well as a decline in net sales of ready to assemble cabinets. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by two percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by one percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in the Cabinets and Related Products segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume in the new home construction and retail markets and the related under absorption of fixed costs, as well as a less favorable product mix which, on a combined basis, reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points compared to 2008. In 2009, operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by increased plant closure and system implementation costs. Such declines were partially offset by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs and a less favorable product mix which reduced operating profit margins by approximately six percentage points compared to 2007, as well as increased plant closure and system implementation costs. In 2008, operating profit margins were also negatively affected by lower results of International operations included in this segment, which reduced operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points compared to 2007. In 2007, operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by the decline in sales volume, as well as increased start up costs and the under utilization of two new plants, and increased severance costs. Such declines were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility of $8 million and benefits associated with business rationalizations and other initiatives. 31 Table of Contents Plumbing Products Net sales of Plumbing Products decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume to North American retailers and wholesalers, which reduced sales by approximately ten percent in both 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007. Reflecting the weakened global economy, net sales in this segment in 2009 and 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of International operations, which reduced sales in this segment by approximately six percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and by approximately three percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases, which increased sales by approximately three percent in both 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were positively affected by increased sales volume of certain International operations, as well as increased selling prices, which were partially offset by declining sales volume to North American retail and wholesale customers. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by two percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in the Plumbing Products segment in 2009 were positively affected by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, as well as a more favorable product mix and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by the decline in North American and International sales volume, which reduced operating profit margins by approximately one percentage point compared to 2007; such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs in early 2007, which were offset by selling price increases and the reduction of certain variable expenses, as well as lower rationalization costs. Installation and Other Services Net sales of Installation and Other Services decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to significantly lower sales volume related to the decline in the new home construction market which declined over 38 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, as well as lower selling prices. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume related to the slowdown in the new home construction market and declines in selling prices, partially offset by acquisitions. Operating profit margins in the Installation and Other Services segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs, selling price decreases and increased system implementation costs. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs, as well as decreased selling prices and increased bad debt expense, which decreased operating profit margins by approximately seven percentage points; such declines were partially offset by material price decreases. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs, lower selling prices and increased bad debt expense, severance and location closure costs and increased system implementation expenses; such declines were partially offset by reductions in material costs, as well as benefits associated with the business rationalizations and other initiatives. Decorative Architectural Products Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased in 2009, primarily due to increased retail sales volume of paints and stains, which offset lower retail sales volume of builders hardware. Sales of paints and stains in 2009 benefited from new product introductions and advertising and promotional activities. Net sales in this segment decreased in 2008, primarily due to lower retail sales volume of paints and stains and builders hardware, which more than offset selling price increases. Net sales in this segment in 2007 were positively affected by higher retail sales volume from new product introductions of paints and stains, which partially offset sales declines related to builders hardware. Operating profit margins in the Decorative Architectural Products segment in 2009 were positively affected by increased sales volume of paints and stains, which more than offset lower sales volume of builders hardware. The operating profit margins in this segment also benefited from the improved 32 Table of Contents relationship between selling prices and commodity costs related to paints and stains and builders hardware, as well as lower program costs related to builders hardware. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of paints and stains and builders hardware, increasing material costs throughout 2008 and program costs for builders hardware, which more than offset the effect of selling price increases. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 primarily reflect increased sales volume of paints and stains, offset by increased advertising expenses. Other Specialty Products Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of windows in the western United States, selling price decreases and a less favorable product mix, which decreased sales in this segment by approximately 12 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Net sales in this segment also decreased in 2009 due to a decline in retail sales of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools, which reduced sales in this segment by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Net sales in this segment in 2008 and 2007 were negatively impacted by lower sales volume of windows and doors, as well as a decline in the home improvement market. Net sales in this segment were also negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of International operations, which reduced sales in this segment by approximately two percent compared to 2007, due to the decline in the United Kingdom markets. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased sales by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and by one percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in the Other Specialty Products segment in 2009 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives which offset the negative affect of lower sales volume of windows and staple gun tackers and other fastening tools and the related under absorption of fixed costs, as well as a less favorable product mix. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related under absorption of fixed costs, which decreased operating profit margins by approximately seven percentage points compared to 2007, as well as increased plant closure costs. Operating profit margins were also negatively affected by lower results of International operations, which reduced operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of windows and doors in the new home construction market and lower results of International operations. Geographic Area Results Discussion North America North American net sales in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets and windows in the new home construction market which decreased sales from North American operations by approximately 12 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, North American net sales were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of cabinets, plumbing products, builders hardware and staple gun tackers and other fastening tools, which aggregated to a net decrease in North American net sales of approximately nine percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains and increased selling prices for certain products. North American net sales in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market which decreased sales from North American operations by approximately 13 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. In addition, North American net sales were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of cabinets, plumbing products, paints and stains and builders hardware, which aggregated to a net decrease in North American sales of approximately eight percent in 2008 compared to 2007. North American sales in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services, cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market, as well as lower retail sales volume of certain products, partially offset by increased retail sales volume of paints and stains. The declines in operating profit margins from North American operations in 2009 were primarily due to sales volume declines and the related under absorption of fixed costs, selling price decreases and a less 33 Table of Contents favorable product mix in new home construction markets, which decreased operating profit margins by one percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit margins were also negatively affected by increased rationalization costs and charges in 2009 compared to 2008. Such declines were partially offset by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs for cabinets, plumbing products and paints and stains, as well as the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. The declines in operating profit margins from North American operations in 2008 were primarily due to declines in new home construction and consumer spending, which negatively impacted the sales volume of the Companys products and decreased operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007. The operating profit margins from North American operations in 2007 were negatively affected by declines in new home construction and consumer spending; such declines were partially offset by selling price increases, and the benefits associated with the Companys business rationalizations and other initiatives. International, Principally Europe Net sales from International operations decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower sales volume of plumbing products and cabinets, which reduced sales from International operations in local currencies by approximately 12 percent compared to 2008 and by approximately 13 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Such declines were partially offset by selling price increases, which increased sales from International operations by approximately two percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007. Net sales from International operations in 2007 were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products. A stronger U.S. dollar decreased International net sales by seven percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker U.S. dollar increased International net sales by three percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating profit margins in 2009 were positively affected by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, as well as the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volumes and the related under absorption of fixed costs, as well as increased severance and plant closure costs. Operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix and material cost increases. Other Matters Commitments and Contingencies Litigation Information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in Note S to the consolidated financial statements. Other Commitments With respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had, at December 31, 2009, commitments to contribute up to $37 million of additional capital to such funds, representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. We are contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. We have no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. Capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid. We enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we operate. Such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; and provisions for sales returns. We have never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and we appropriately record an estimated liability when probable. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides payment obligations related to current contracts at December 31, 2009, in millions: Payments Due by Period Less than 2 3 4 5 More than 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Other(D) Total Debt (A) $ 364 $ 879 $ 203 $ 2,522 $ $ 3,968 Interest (A) 217 411 314 860 1,802 Operating leases 68 80 42 53 243 Currently payable income taxes 12 12 Defined benefit plans 45 94 102 280 521 Private equity funds (B) 19 18 37 Post retirement obligations 1 1 2 4 8 Purchase commitments (C) 195 3 198 Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties (D) 8 78 86 Total $ 929 $ 1,486 $ 663 $ 3,719 $ 78 $ 6,875 (A) We assumed that all debt would be held to maturity, except for the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes which have been classified as short term debt at December 31, 2009. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for more information. (B) There is no schedule for the capital commitments to the private equity funds; such allocation was estimated. (C) Excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and open or pending purchase orders. (D) Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the period beyond the next year in which cash settlements may occur with applicable tax authorities. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 35 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to our marketable securities and other investments. We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations and from time to time commodity fluctuations. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments. At December 31, 2009, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the European euro and the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2009, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of our long term investments. Based upon the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 36 Table of Contents
