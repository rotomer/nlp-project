Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by Mattel or its representatives in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, other filings or reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and may include, but are not limited to, statements about sales levels, restructuring, special charges, other non recurring charges, cost savings, operating efficiencies and profitability. Mattel is including this Cautionary Statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any such forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements. Forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "may," "will," "should," "project," "continue," "plans," "aims," "intends," "likely," or other similar words or phrases. Management cautions you that forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements. In addition to the important factors detailed herein and from time to time in other reports filed by Mattel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Forms 8 K, 10 Q and 10 K, the following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from past results or those suggested by any forward looking statements. Competition and New Product Introductions Mattels business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of its toy products. Consumer preferences are continuously changing. In recent years there have been trends towards shorter life cycles for individual products, the phenomenon of children outgrowing toys at younger ages particularly in favor of interactive and high technology products and an increasing use of high technology in toys. In addition, Mattel competes with many other companies, both large and small, which means that Mattels market position is always at risk. Mattels ability to maintain its current market share, and increase its market share or establish market share in new product categories, will depend on Mattels ability to satisfy consumer preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and achieve market acceptance of such products. If Mattel does not successfully meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner, demand for its products will decrease and Mattels results of operations will suffer. Seasonality, Managing Production and Predictability of Orders Mattels business is subject to risks associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Sales of toy products at retail are seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December. As a result, Mattels annual operating results will depend, in large part, on sales during the relatively brief holiday season. Retailers are attempting to manage their inventories better, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. This in turn results in shorter lead times for production. 14 Shortages of raw materials or components also may affect Mattels ability to produce products in time to meet retailer demand. These factors increase the risk that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times, or that Mattels own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre build products before orders are placed. Adverse General Economic Conditions Mattels results of operations may be negatively affected by adverse changes in general economic conditions in the US and internationally, including adverse changes in the retail environment. These adverse changes may be as a result of softening global economies, wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks such as those in the US on September 11, 2001, or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. Such changes may negatively affect the sales of Mattels products, increase exposure to losses for bad debt, or increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing these products. Customer Concentration A small number of Mattels customers account for a large share of net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Mattels three largest customers, Wal Mart, Toys "R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 50% of net sales, and the ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 64% of net sales. The concentration of Mattels business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattels large customers were to significantly reduce purchases for any reason. In addition, some large chain retailers have begun to sell private label toys designed and branded by the retailers themselves. Such toys may be sold at prices lower than comparable toys sold by Mattel, and may result in lower purchases of Mattel branded products by such retailers. Rationalization of Mass Market Retail Channel and Bankruptcy of Key Customers Many of Mattels key customers are mass market retailers. The mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. In 2001 and 2002, two large customers of Mattel filed for bankruptcy. Mattels sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of Mattel. This could increase Mattels exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if these or other customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy, it could have a material adverse affect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation and Disputes Mattel is involved in a number of litigation matters, including purported securities class action claims stemming from the merger with The Learning Company and the performance of the Learning Company division in the second half of 1999. An unfavorable resolution of the pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on Mattels financial condition. The litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of Mattels management regardless of the outcome. There can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to achieve a favorable settlement of the pending litigation or obtain a favorable resolution of such litigation if it is not settled. In addition, current and future litigation, governmental proceedings, labor disputes or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of normal business operations of Mattel. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights The value of Mattels business depends to a large degree on its ability to protect its intellectual property, including its trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets in the US and around the world. 15 Any failure by Mattel to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information, including any successful challenge to Mattels ownership of its intellectual property or material infringements of such property, could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Political Developments, including Trade Relations, and the Threat or Occurrence of Terrorist Activities Mattels business is worldwide in scope, including operations in 36 countries. The deterioration of the political situation in a country in which Mattel has significant sales or operations, or the breakdown of trade relations between the US and a foreign country in which Mattel has significant manufacturing facilities or other operations, could adversely affect Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a change in trade status for China could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of toys manufactured in China and imported into the US. In addition, the occurrence or threat of terrorist activities, and the responses to and results of such activities, could materially impact Mattel, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, retail and financial markets and general economic conditions. Manufacturing Risk Mattel owns and operates manufacturing facilities and utilizes third party manufacturers throughout Asia, primarily in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. A risk of political instability and civil unrest exists in these countries, which could temporarily or permanently damage Mattels manufacturing operations located there. Mattels business, financial position and results of operations would be negatively impacted by a significant disruption to its manufacturing operations or suppliers. Financial Realignment Plan Mattel announced a significant financial realignment plan in 2000, which was designed to improve gross margins; selling and administrative expenses; operating profit; and cash flow. See "2000 Financial Realignment Plan" and Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements." The financial realignment plan requires substantial management and financial resources to implement. The plan may not achieve intended cost reductions or adequately address significant operating issues. The failure of the plan to meet its objectives in whole or in part, or any delay in implementing the plan, could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2002, as part of the financial realignment plan, Mattel will commence a long term information technology strategy to help it better manage the business, while lowering costs in procurement, finance, distribution and manufacturing. The failure of this program to meet its objectives in whole or in part, or any delay in implementing the program, could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Financing Matters Increases in interest rates, both domestically and internationally, could negatively affect Mattels cost of financing both its operations and investments. Foreign currency exchange fluctuations may affect Mattels reportable income. Reductions in Mattels credit ratings may negatively impact the cost of satisfying Mattels financing requirements. Advertising and Promotion Mattels products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Mattels ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of such programs. If Mattel does not successfully market its products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have a material adverse affect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 Success of New Initiatives Mattel has announced initiatives to improve the execution of its core business, globalize and extend Mattels brands, catch new industry trends and develop employees. Successful implementation of Mattels initiatives will require substantial resources and the attention of Mattels management team. Failure to successfully implement any of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in Laws and Regulations Mattel operates in a highly regulated environment in the US and internationally. US federal, state and local governmental entities and foreign governments regulate many aspects of Mattels business including its products and the importation and export of its products. Such regulations may include taxes, trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. Changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs or the interruption of normal business operations. Acquisition, Dispositions and Takeover Defenses Mattel may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, which may affect the profit, revenues, profit margins, debt to equity ratios, capital expenditures, or other aspects of Mattels business. In addition, Mattel has certain anti takeover provisions in its charter and by laws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Mattel without its consent, which may adversely affect Mattels stock price. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors listed above actually occur, Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The factors listed above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, Mattel operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all such factors on Mattels business, financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and any other public statement made by Mattel or its representatives may turn out to be wrong. Mattel expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Summary The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Mattels consolidated financial statements for all periods present the Consumer Software segment as a discontinued operation. See "Discontinued Operations." Unless otherwise indicated, the following discussion relates only to Mattels continuing operations. Additionally, the segment and brand category information was restated from the prior year presentation to conform to the current management structure. See "Business Segment Results." Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of toy products on a worldwide basis through both sales to retailers (i.e., "customers") and direct to consumers. Mattels business is dependent in great part on its ability each year to redesign, restyle and extend existing core products and product lines, to design and develop innovative new products and product lines, and to successfully market those products and product lines. Mattel plans to continue to focus on its portfolio of traditional brands that have historically had worldwide sustainable appeal, to create new brands utilizing its knowledge of childrens play patterns and to 17 target customer and consumer preferences around the world. Mattel also intends to expand its core brands through the Internet, and licensing and entertainment partnerships. Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories: Girls including Barbie(R) fashion dolls and accessories, collector dolls, Polly Pocket!(R), Diva Starz(TM), Whats Her Face!(TM) and American Girl(R) Boys Entertainment including Hot Wheels(R), Matchbox(R), Hot Wheels(R) Electric Racing, and Tyco(R) Radio Control vehicles and playsets (collectively "Wheels"), and Disney, Nickelodeon(R), Harry Potter(TM), Max Steel(TM), and games and puzzles (collectively "Entertainment") Infant & Preschool including Fisher Price(R), Power Wheels(R), Sesame Street(R), Disney preschool and plush, Winnie the Pooh(R), Blues Clues(R), See "N Say(R), Magna Doodle(R), and View Master(R) Results of Continuing Operations 2001 Compared to 2000 Consolidated Results Net income from continuing operations for 2001 was $310.9 million or $0.71 per diluted share as compared to net income from continuing operations of $170.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share in 2000. Profitability in 2001 was negatively impacted by $50.2 million of charges related to the financial realignment plan and a $5.5 million charge related to a pre tax loss on derivative instruments. The combined effect of these items resulted in pre tax charges totaling $55.7 million, approximately $41 million after tax or $0.10 per diluted share. Profitability in 2000 was negatively impacted by a $125.2 million pre tax charge related to the initial phase of the financial realignment plan, a $53.1 million pre tax charge for the departure of certain senior executives in the first quarter, and an $8.4 million pre tax charge related to losses realized on the disposition of a portion of the stock received as part of the sale of CyberPatrol. These charges were partially offset by a $7.0 million reversal of the 1999 reserve related to restructuring and other charges. The combined effect of these items resulted in net pre tax charges totaling $179.7 million, approximately $123 million after tax or $0.29 per diluted share. The following table provides a comparison of the reported results and the results excluding charges (in millions): For the Year 2001 2000 Reported Results Reported Results Results Charges Ex.

Global economies softened; the September 11th terrorist attacks eroded US consumer confidence; and as a result, several important US retailers cancelled holiday reorders as they intensified their focus on inventory management in light of uncertain consumer spending prospects. The difficult retail environment, combined with increased competitive pressures, resulted in a weakening in the financial strength of some major US retail industry participants. Kmart, the second largest US retailer, filed for bankruptcy in January 2002. On March 8, 2002, Kmart announced plans to close 284 stores. This action will likely have a negative impact on Mattels US sales growth in 2002. Net sales from continuing operations for 2001 increased 3% to $4.8 billion, from $4.7 billion in 2000. In local currency, net sales were up 4% compared to 2000. Net sales within the US declined less than 1% from 2000 and accounted for 69% of consolidated net sales in 2001 compared to 71% in 2000. In 2001, net sales outside the US increased 11% from 2000. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, international net sales increased 13% compared to 2000. Worldwide gross sales in the Girls category, which includes American Girl(R), increased 3%, or 4% in local currency, to $2.2 billion. Domestic sales declined by 4%, while international sales increased by 17%, or 20% in local currency. The growth in the Girls category was driven by Polly Pocket!(R), Diva Starz(TM), Whats Her Face!(TM), American Girl(R) and international sales of Barbie(R). Worldwide Barbie(R) sales decreased 3% in both US dollars and in local currency. Barbie(R) sales in the US declined 12% in 2001 as compared to the strong growth recorded last year, when sales increased 9% over 1999. The decline in US Barbie(R) sales was largely due to lower shipments of Holiday Celebration(TM) Barbie(R) in response to lower demand at retail, lower sales of adult targeted collector dolls resulting from a weakening retail climate for higher priced collectible items, and continuing inventory management by retailers. International sales for Barbie(R) were up 12%, or 15% in local currency, reflecting the benefit of early product availability and stronger alignment of worldwide sales and marketing plans. Worldwide gross sales in the Boys Entertainment category grew 6%, or 7% in local currency, to $1.3 billion. Domestic sales grew by 2%, while international sales increased by 13%, or 16% in local currency. The worldwide Wheels business increased 1% due to a 9% sales growth in Hot Wheels(R) products, which was partially offset by declines in the Matchbox(R) and Tyco(R) Radio Control brands. The Entertainment business grew 14%, largely due to the global introduction of Harry Potter(TM) products. Sales generated by the Harry Potter(TM) brand more than offset the decline of the Disney entertainment business, which will be completely phased out in 2002. In second quarter 2001, Mattel expanded its games business through the acquisition of Pictionary(R) Inc. ("Pictionary(R)"), worldwide owner of the Pictionary(R) game brand and associated rights. Beginning in January 2002, Mattel will manufacture, market and distribute Pictionary(R) to international markets. In the US and Canada, Mattel is the licensor of the property through an independent contractor. Worldwide sales in the Infant & Preschool category were $1.6 billion, down 1% both in US dollars and in local currency. Domestic sales were flat, while international sales decreased 4%, or 3% in local currency. Growth in sales of core Fisher Price(R) and Power Wheels(R) products was offset by a decline in licensed character brands. In 2001, Mattel executed a worldwide license agreement to sell Barney(TM) products, the full impact of which will be included in 2002 sales of licensed character brands. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 47.2% in 2001 compared to 45.0% in 2000. Cost of sales in 2001 includes a $28.2 million charge, largely related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the planned closure of the Murray, Kentucky manufacturing facility ("North American Strategy") and termination of a licensing agreement as part of the financial realignment plan. Cost of sales in 2000 includes a $78.6 million charge related to the termination of a variety of licensing agreements and other contractual arrangements and elimination of product lines that did not deliver an adequate level of profitability. Excluding the financial realignment plan charges, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was up by 110 basis points to 47.8% in 2001 versus 46.7% a year ago. Gross profit was positively impacted by savings realized from the financial realignment plan and lower product costs achieved through the supply chain initiative, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The supply chain initiative has focused on improving customer service 19 levels by partnering with retailers to get the right products in the right place at the right time, lowering costs by restructuring Mattels manufacturing and distribution facilities, and improving processes such as launching fewer new SKUs by taking advantage of multi lingual packaging. The multi lingual packaging provides Mattel with increased distribution options for any given toy. Advertising and promotion expense was 13.8% of net sales for 2001, compared to 14.7% in 2000. Advertising and promotion expense for 2001 and 2000 includes $0.3 million and $4.8 million of charges, respectively, largely related to exiting certain product lines. Excluding these financial realignment charges, advertising and promotion expenses, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 14.6% in 2000 to 13.8% in 2001, largely due to lower prices charged by media companies on a cost per rating point basis. Mattels 2001 media plan was actually stronger than last years in terms of gross rating points. Mattel expects media costs for 2002 will remain at approximately the same level for the first half of the year, and will likely increase towards the second half of the year. Beginning in 2002, advertising and promotion expenses related to certain customer benefits will be recorded as an adjustment to net sales in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer. Prior years results will be retroactively restated to reflect this change. See "New Accounting Pronouncements." Other selling and administrative expenses were $936.1 million or 19.5% of net sales in 2001 compared to $967.0 million or 20.7% of net sales in 2000. Other selling and administrative expenses in 2001 includes a $22.1 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the bankruptcy filing of Kmart and a $1.5 million charge related to streamlining back office functions as part of the financial realignment plan. The $22.1 million charge for the Kmart bankruptcy represents approximately one half of Mattels outstanding pre petition account receivable after offsetting customer benefits, which Mattel believes it is no longer obligated to pay to Kmart under the terms of its customer agreement. Mattels remaining pre petition account receivable from Kmart, after offsetting the reserve for bad debts and reserves for customer benefits that were not earned by Kmart, is $36.2 million. To estimate the net realizable value of the Kmart pre petition account receivable, management considered the post petition market price for the Kmart bank debt, bonds and trade receivables. Other selling and administrative expenses for 2000 includes a $5.9 million charge related to settlement of certain litigation matters and a $53.1 million charge related to termination costs for the departure of senior executives. Excluding the aforementioned charges, other selling and administrative expenses declined from 19.4% of net sales in 2000 to 19.0% of net sales in 2001. The improvement in other selling and administrative expenses, excluding the charges, is largely due to tight management of costs, savings realized from the financial realignment plan, and a reduction in management bonuses, partially offset by increased bad debt charges. Other expense (income), net in 2001 includes a $5.5 million loss on derivative instruments and $4.5 million of charges primarily related to asset writedowns and other costs associated with implementing the North American Strategy. Other expense (income), net in 2000 includes $12.5 million of charges primarily related to the writeoff of certain noncurrent assets and an $8.4 million charge related to losses realized on the disposition of a portion of the stock received as part of the sale of CyberPatrol. Excluding these charges, other expense (income), net decreased from income of $19.3 million in 2000 to expense of $7.4 million in 2001. The decline was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, lower investment income and increased charitable contributions. Interest expense was $155.1 million in 2001 compared with $153.0 million in 2000. The increase was due to the allocation in 2000 of $36.4 million in interest to discontinued operations. In 2001, lower average borrowing rates and lower short term seasonal borrowings resulted in a decrease in interest expense. For 2002, Mattel expects interest expense to decrease slightly compared to 2001, reflecting the anticipated lower average borrowings combined with increasing short term interest rates beginning mid year as Mattel moves towards its peak borrowing period for seasonal working capital financing. 20 Business Segment Results Mattels reportable segments are separately managed business units and are divided on a geographic basis between domestic and international. The domestic segment is further divided into US Girls, US Boys Entertainment, and US Infant & Preschool. The US Girls segment includes brands such as Barbie(R), Polly Pocket!(R), Diva Starz(TM), Whats Her Face!(TM) and American Girl(R). The US Boys Entertainment segment includes Hot Wheels(R), Matchbox(R), Hot Wheels(R) Electric Racing and Tyco(R) Radio Control (collectively "Wheels"), and Disney, Nickelodeon(R), Harry Potter(TM), Max Steel(TM) and games and puzzles (collectively "Entertainment") products. The US Infant & Preschool segment includes Fisher Price(R), Disney preschool and plush, Power Wheels(R), Sesame Street(R) and other preschool products. The International segment sells products in all toy categories. Mattels segments were revised in January 2001 to conform to the current management structure. Specifically, the results of Pleasant Company, which had been previously reported as part of Other, are now being reported as part of US Girls, which is consistent with management responsibility for this business. Additionally, Mattels toy manufacturing unit is now being managed as a cost center instead of as a profit center; therefore, toy manufacturing is no longer being reported as a separate segment. Lastly, certain overhead costs incurred at the headquarters level in El Segundo, including facilities, information technology, and other administration support costs, are now being allocated to the US Girls and US Boys Entertainment segments, to more accurately reflect the costs associated with operating these businesses. These types of overhead costs were already being reported as part of the US Infant & Preschool and International segments since these businesses maintain their own, separate headquarters locations. All prior periods have been restated to reflect these changes. As used in this Form 10 K, "sales" or "gross sales" means sales excluding the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts or other allowances. "Net sales" includes the impact of such sales adjustments. Business Segment Results should be read in conjunction with Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements." US Girls segment sales decreased by 4% in 2001 compared to 2000. A 12% decline in Barbie(R) sales was partially offset by increased sales of Polly Pocket!(R), Diva Starz(TM), Whats Her Face!(TM) and American Girl(R). The decrease in US Barbie(R) sales compared to 2000 was primarily due to lower shipments of Holiday Celebration(TM) Barbie(R) in response to lower demand at retail, lower sales of adult targeted collector dolls resulting from a weakening retail climate for higher priced collectible items, and continuing inventory management by retailers. US Boys Entertainment segment sales increased 2%. The US Entertainment business grew 6%, largely due to increased sales of Harry Potter(TM) products. The US Wheels business was flat with last year as increased sales of Hot Wheels(R) products were offset by declines in Tyco(R) Radio Control and Matchbox(R). US Infant & Preschool segment sales were flat with 2000. Growth in sales of core Fisher Price(R) and Power Wheels(R) products was offset by a decline in sales of licensed character brand products. Management believes the difficult retail environment, especially combined with the events of September 11, 2001, caused its retail customers to curtail their orders across all of the US segments during the fourth quarter, resulting in an 8% decline in total US sales for the fourth quarter. However, despite weaker than expected shipments to retailers, all of Mattels major brands showed strength with consumers and posted sales increases at retail. According to NPD industry data for toy sales at the consumer level, Mattel gained market share in the US in dolls, vehicles, action figures, games and puzzles and core infant and preschool categories. Mattels market share of total traditional toys grew 1.2 percentage points to 23.5% in the US. International segment sales increased by 10% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange impact, sales grew by 13% due to double digit growth in Barbie(R), Polly Pocket!(R), core Fisher Price(R) and Hot Wheels(R) products combined with the expansion of Diva Starz(TM) and Harry Potter(TM) products. Mattel also recorded strong market share gains outside the US, with market share growing in the five major European markets, as well as in Canada, Mexico and Australia. Improved product availability, better alignment of worldwide marketing and sales plans and strong product launches were the primary drivers for the growth in International segment sales and market share. 21 Operating profit in the US Girls segment decreased by 2%, primarily due to lower sales volume. Operating profit in the US Boys Entertainment segment increased 39%, primarily due to increased sales volume and improved margins. Operating profit in the US Infant & Preschool segment increased 2%, primarily due to improved margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses to support certain new product lines. All the US segments benefited from lower costs per rating point for media purchases. The International segment operating profit increased 26%, largely due to increased sales volume and improved margins, partially offset by lower operating profit in certain Latin American countries and unfavorable foreign exchange. In Latin America, Mattel has appointed a new management team with the goal of converting sales growth into increased cash flow and profitability in this region. 2000 Compared to 1999 Consolidated Results Net income from continuing operations for 2000 was $170.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share as compared to net income from continuing operations of $108.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share in 1999. Profitability in 2000 was negatively impacted by a $125.2 million pre tax charge related to the initial phase of the financial realignment plan, a $53.1 million pre tax charge for the departure of certain senior executives in the first quarter, and an $8.4 million pre tax charge related to losses realized on the disposition of a portion of the stock received as part of the sale of CyberPatrol. These charges were partially offset by a $7.0 million reversal of the 1999 reserve related to restructuring and other charges. The combined effect of theses items, resulted in a pre tax net charge of $179.7 million, approximately $123 million after tax or $0.29 per diluted share. Profitability in 1999 was negatively impacted by a $281.1 million charge, approximately $218 million after tax or $0.51 per diluted share, related to restructuring and other charges.

In local currency, net sales were up 4% in 2000 compared to 1999. Net sales within the US increased 4% and accounted for 71% of consolidated net sales in 2000 compared to 70% in 1999. Net sales outside the US decreased 3% from 1999. Excluding the unfavorable exchange impact, international net sales increased 6% compared to 1999. Worldwide gross sales in the Girls category, which includes American Girl(R), increased 5%, or 8% in local currency, to $2.1 billion. Domestic sales increased by 10%, while international sales decreased by 4%. The worldwide growth in the Girls category was due to increased sales of Barbie(R) and American Girl(R) products, 22 partially offset by decreased sales of large dolls. Worldwide Barbie(R) sales increased 5%, up 9% in the US and down 1% in international markets. Excluding the unfavorable exchange impact, Barbie(R) sales were up 8% in international markets. Worldwide gross sales in the Boys Entertainment category were flat, or up 2% in local currency. Domestic sales decreased by 4%, while international sales increased by 7%, or 14% in local currency. The Boys Entertainment category was negatively impacted by lower sales of Toy Story 2 products in 2000 compared to 1999. Excluding the impact of Toy Story 2 and Harry Potter(TM) products, the Boys Entertainment category grew 2% for the year. Worldwide Wheels sales decreased 2%, or were flat before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Sales of Entertainment products increased 2% worldwide, driven by strength of Max Steel(TM), Mattel games and Harry Potter(TM) products, partially offset by lower sales of Toy Story 2 products. Worldwide gross sales in the Infant & Preschool category were flat, or up 3% in local currency. Domestic sales grew by 4%, while international sales decreased by 10%, or 2% in local currency. Worldwide sales of core Fisher Price(R) products grew 26%, up 37% in the US and flat in international markets. Excluding the unfavorable exchange impact, core Fisher Price(R) products were up 11% in international markets. Declines in worldwide sales for Sesame Street(R), Disney preschool and Winnie the Pooh(R) offset domestic growth in core Fisher Price(R) products. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.0% in 2000 compared to 47.5% in 1999. Cost of sales in 2000 includes a $78.6 million charge related to the termination of a variety of licensing agreements and other contractual arrangements and elimination of product lines that did not deliver an adequate level of profitability. Excluding financial realignment plan charges, gross profit was 46.7% in 2000 compared to 47.5% in 1999 due to unfavorable product mix, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and higher shipping costs. Advertising and promotion expense was 14.7% of net sales in 2000 compared to 14.9% in 1999. Excluding the $4.8 million financial realignment plan charge, largely related to exiting certain product lines, advertising and promotion expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 14.6% in 2000. The decrease was attributable to improved efficiencies of promotional spending. Other selling and administrative expenses were 20.7% of net sales in 2000 compared to 18.9% in 1999. Excluding the $5.9 million charge related to settlement of certain litigation matters and the $53.1 million charge related to termination costs for the departure of senior executives, other selling and administrative expenses were 19.4% of net sales in 2000. The increase was largely due to compensation costs incurred for the recruitment and retention of senior executives. Other expense (income), net in 2000 includes a $12.5 million charge primarily related to the writeoff of certain noncurrent assets and an $8.4 million charge related to losses realized on the disposition of a portion of the stock received as part of the sale of CyberPatrol. Excluding these charges, the $14.1 million increase in other expense (income), net was largely due to investment and interest income. Interest expense was $153.0 million in 2000 compared with $131.6 million in 1999, largely due to higher borrowings necessitated by the funding of Mattels Consumer Software business. In addition, Mattels overall interest rate was higher due to increased market rates and debt refinancing that occurred during the second half of the year. Business Segment Results US Girls segment sales increased by 10% in 2000 compared to 1999 due to a 9% increase in sales of Barbie(R) products and a 7% increase in sales of American Girl(R) products. US Boys Entertainment segment sales decreased 4% due to a 3% decrease in sales of Wheels products and a 7% decrease in sales of Entertainment products. Within the Wheels category, Mattel gained market share. However, sales fell below 1999 levels as relatively high retail inventories were adjusted down throughout 2000. Within the Entertainment 23 category, growth from Max Steel(TM) and Mattel games were more than offset by lower sales of movie related toy products relative to the 1999 strong sales of Toy Story 2 products. Excluding Harry Potter(TM) and Toy Story 2, Entertainment sales were up 10% in domestic markets. US Infant & Preschool segment sales increased 4%, largely due to increased sales of core Fisher Price(R) and Power Wheels(R) products, partially offset by declines in sales of Sesame Street(R), Disney preschool and Winnie the Pooh(R) products. International segment sales decreased by 3% in 2000 compared to 1999. Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange impact, sales grew by 6% in 2000 due to increased sales across all core categories, including Barbie(R), Fisher Price(R), Wheels and Entertainment products. Operating profit in the US Girls segment increased by 9%, largely due to higher sales volume. The US Boys Entertainment segment experienced a 26% decline in operating profit, largely due to lower sales volume and higher shipping costs. Operating profit in the US Infant & Preschool segment increased 7% due to greater sales of relatively higher margin core Fisher Price(R) products. The International segment operating profit decreased 19%, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 2000 Financial Realignment Plan During the third quarter of 2000, Mattel initiated a financial realignment plan designed to improve gross margin; selling and administrative expenses; operating profit; and cash flow. The financial realignment plan, together with the disposition of Learning Company, was part of managements strategic plan to focus on growing Mattels core brands and lowering operating costs and interest expense. The plan will require a total pre tax charge estimated at approximately $250 million or $170 million on an after tax basis, of which approximately $100 million represents cash expenditures and $70 million represents non cash writedowns. Total cash outlay will be funded from existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows from operations. Under the plan, Mattel expects to generate approximately $200 million of cumulative pre tax cost savings over the three year duration of the plan. Mattel recognized savings of approximately $55 million in 2001 and expects to achieve savings of approximately $65 million in 2002. However, there is no assurance that Mattel will be able to successfully implement all phases of its financial realignment plan or that it will realize the anticipated cost savings and improved cash flows. Through December 31, 2001, Mattel has recorded pre tax charges totaling $175.4 million, or approximately $119 million on an after tax basis, related to this plan. Of the total charge, $125.2 million (approximately $84 million after taxes) was recorded in 2000 and $50.2 million (approximately $35 million after taxes) was recorded in 2001. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, future pre tax implementation costs of approximately $75 million have not been accrued as of December 31, 2001. Management expects these costs will be recorded over approximately the next two years. The following are the major initiatives included in the financial realignment plan: . Reduce excess manufacturing capacity; . Terminate a variety of licensing and other contractual arrangements that do not deliver an adequate level of profitability; . Eliminate product lines that do not meet required levels of profitability; . Improve supply chain performance and economics; . Eliminate positions at US based headquarters locations in El Segundo, Fisher Price and Pleasant Company through a combination of layoffs, elimination of open requisitions, attrition and retirements; and . Close and consolidate certain international offices. 24 In April 2001, as part of the financial realignment plan, Mattel announced the closure of its Murray, Kentucky manufacturing facility (the "North American Strategy"). Production from this facility will be consolidated into other Mattel owned and operated facilities in North America with the final shutdown of Murray operations occurring in 2002. This action is one of the realignment measures taken to lower costs. Mattel believes this action was necessary in order to maintain a competitive cost structure in todays global marketplace. In 2000, Mattel recorded a $22.9 million pre tax restructuring charge as part of the initial phase of the financial realignment plan. This charge, combined with a $7.0 million adjustment to the 1999 restructuring plan, resulted in $15.9 million of net pre tax restructuring and other charges in 2000. The $22.9 million charge related to the elimination of positions at headquarters locations in El Segundo, Fisher Price and Pleasant Company, closure of certain international offices, and consolidation of facilities. During 2001, Mattel recorded a $15.7 million pre tax restructuring charge as part of the financial realignment plan, largely related to the North American Strategy. Total worldwide headcount reduction as a result of the restructuring is planned to be approximately 1,700 employees, of which approximately 1,100 are related to the North American Strategy. From inception through December 31, 2001, a total of approximately $19 million has been incurred related to the termination of nearly 980 employees, of which approximately 640 were terminated during 2001. The components of the restructuring charges are as follows (in millions): Balance Balance 2000 Amounts Dec. 31, 2001 Amounts Dec. 31, Charges Incurred 2000 Charges Incurred 2001 Severance and other compensation............. $19 $(3) $16 $ 9 $(16) $ 9 Asset writedowns.......... 2 (2) Lease termination costs... 1 1 2 (1) 2 Other..................... 1 1 5 (5) 1 Total restructuring charge................... $23 $(5) $18 $16 $(22) $12 In January 2002, as part of the financial realignment plan, Mattel announced a further headcount reduction of approximately 240 positions at its domestic headquarters locations through a combination of layoffs, elimination of open requisitions, attrition and retirements. Additionally, in 2002, Mattel will commence a long term information technology strategy aimed at achieving operating efficiencies and cost savings across all disciplines. The program is focused on simplifying Mattels organization by defining common global processes based on industry best practices, streamlining its organization by eliminating redundancies, and upgrading its systems to have greater visibility to information and data on a global basis. 1999 Restructuring and Other Charges During 1999, Mattel initiated a restructuring plan for its continuing operations and incurred certain other charges totaling $281.1 million, approximately $218 million after tax. The 1999 restructuring plan was aimed at leveraging global resources in the areas of manufacturing, marketing and distribution, eliminating duplicative functions worldwide and achieving improved operating efficiencies. As of December 31, 2000, the restructuring activities provided for by this charge were complete and substantially all amounts previously accrued had been paid as of December 31, 2001. Other charges incurred in 1999 principally related to the 1998 recall of Mattels Power Wheels(R) vehicles and environmental remediation costs related to a former manufacturing facility on a leased property in Beaverton, Oregon. The liability remaining related to these charges was approximately $22 million and $24 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 25 Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 27.7% in 2001 compared to 24.5% in 2000 and 36.3% in 1999. The difference in the overall tax rate on continuing operations between 1999, 2000 and 2001 was caused by the restructuring and other charges. In 1999, a significant portion of the restructuring expenses consisted of transactional expenses which were not deductible for tax purposes, resulting in a lower effective tax benefit on these restructuring charges, and a higher overall effective tax rate. In 2000 and 2001, most of the restructuring and other charges were deductible for tax purposes and provided a benefit at or near the effective US tax rate, resulting in a relatively lower overall effective tax rate for 2001 and 2000 as compared to 1999. The pre tax income (loss) from US operations includes interest expense, amortization of intangibles and corporate headquarters expenses. Therefore, the pre tax income (loss) from US operations, as a percentage of the consolidated pre tax income, was less than the sales to US customers as a percentage of the consolidated gross sales. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Mattel, Inc. federal income tax returns through December 31, 1994 and is currently examining Mattels federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1995 through 1997. Liquidity and Capital Resources Mattels primary sources of liquidity over the last three years have been cash on hand at the beginning of the year, cash flows generated from continuing operations, long term debt issuances and short term seasonal borrowings. Cash flows from continuing operations could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for Mattels products, which could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions and changes in public and consumer preferences, or increased costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of products or realized shortages in raw materials or component parts. Additionally, Mattels ability to issue long term debt and obtain seasonal borrowing could be adversely affected by factors such as an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements, which include maintaining consolidated debt to capital and interest coverage ratios, or a deterioration of Mattels credit ratings. Mattels ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity. Operating Activities Operating activities generated cash flows from continuing operations of $756.8 million during 2001, compared to $555.1 million in 2000 and $430.5 million in 1999. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2001 was largely due to increased income from continuing operations and increased cash collections. In addition, the disposition of Learning Company in the fourth quarter 2000 resulted in improved cash flows since Mattel was no longer required to fund this business. Investing Activities Mattel invested its cash flows during the last three years mainly in tooling to support new products and construction of new manufacturing facilities. In 2001, Mattel acquired Pictionary(R) for approximately $29 million, of which approximately $21 million was paid in 2001 and the remaining $8 million will be paid over the next 3 years. Financing Activities In 2001, as part of Mattels goal to improve its debt to capital ratio, cash flows from operating activities were used to repay short term borrowing obligations. Additionally, Mattel announced during the third quarter of 2000 a change in its dividend policy consisting of a reduction in the annual cash dividend from $0.36 per share 26 to $0.05 per share when and as declared by the board of directors. The $0.05 per share annual dividend rate under the new dividend policy became effective in December 2001. The reduction of the dividend resulted in annual cash savings of approximately $132 million, which Mattel used to reduce debt. During 2001, Mattel repaid $30.5 million of its medium term notes, which became due in the fourth quarter. In 2000, Mattel received proceeds from the issuance of a term loan and Euro Notes, which were used to repay its 6 3/4% Senior Notes upon maturity and to support operating activities. In 1999, Mattel increased its short term borrowings to support its operating activities and to fund the Consumer Software segment. During 1999, Mattel repaid $30.0 million of its medium term notes. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, Mattel paid dividends on its common stock and, in 1999, Mattel repurchased treasury stock. In 2001 and 2000, Mattel did not repurchase treasury stock. Seasonal Financing Mattel expects to finance its seasonal working capital requirements for the coming year by using existing and internally generated cash, issuing commercial paper, selling certain trade receivables and using various short term bank lines of credit. Mattels domestic unsecured committed revolving credit facility provides $1.0 billion in short term borrowings from a commercial bank group. Within this facility, up to $300.0 million is available for non recourse sales of certain trade accounts receivable to the bank group as an additional source of liquidity and to lower its borrowing cost. Such non recourse sales are made pursuant to an arrangement whereby certain of Mattels subsidiaries sell receivables to Mattel Factoring, Inc., which in turn sells those receivables to the commercial bank group. Mattel Factoring, Inc. is a separate special purpose legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. This facility was executed in 1998 for a term of five years, expiring in 2003. In March 2002, Mattel amended and restated this facility into a $1.060 billion, 3 year facility that expires in 2005 with substantially similar terms and conditions. Additionally, during 2001, Mattel utilized a 364 day $400.0 million unsecured committed credit facility with essentially the same terms and conditions as the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. Mattel has elected not to renew this facility when it expires in March 2002, as it believes that cash on hand at the beginning of 2002 and its $1.060 billion domestic unsecured committed revolving facility will be sufficient to meet its seasonal working capital requirements in 2002. Mattel also has a $200.0 million senior unsecured term loan that matures in July 2003. Interest is charged at various rates, ranging from a LIBOR based rate to the bank reference rate (3.66% as of December 31, 2001). Both the unsecured credit facilities and term loan require Mattel to meet financial covenants for consolidated debt to capital and interest coverage. Mattel was in compliance with such covenants during 2001. In addition, Mattel avails itself of uncommitted domestic facilities provided by certain banks to issue short term money market loans. To meet seasonal borrowing requirements of certain foreign subsidiaries, Mattel negotiates individual financing arrangements, generally with the same group of banks that provided credit in the prior year. Foreign credit lines total approximately $368 million, a portion of which is used to support letters of credit. Mattel expects to extend these credit lines throughout 2002 and believes available amounts will be adequate to meet its seasonal financing requirements. Mattel also enters into agreements with banks of its foreign subsidiaries for non recourse sales of certain of its foreign subsidiary receivables. In fourth quarter 2001, Mattel entered into a securitization agreement to sell certain receivables of its French and German subsidiaries with one of its European banks. 27 Mattels accounts receivable sold or anticipated, and therefore excluded from its consolidated balance sheets, is summarized as follows (in millions): As of Year End 2001 2000 Domestic factoring and anticipation.............................. $261.5 $347.5 Foreign factoring................................................ 237.2 196.9 Total factoring and anticipation................................. $498.7 $544.4 Financial Position Mattels cash and short term investments increased by $384.2 million to $616.6 million at year end 2001 compared to $232.4 million at year end 2000. The increase was primarily due to cash flows generated from operating activities. Accounts receivable, net decreased by $143.0 million to $696.6 million at year end 2001, reflecting improved cash collections and the bad debt write off resulting from the bankruptcy of Kmart. Inventories decreased slightly to $487.5 million at year end 2001. Inventory levels were negatively impacted by lower than expected domestic fourth quarter sales and the pre build initiative to prepare for the closing of the Murray, Kentucky plant in 2002 in connection with the North American Strategy. During 2002, Mattel plans to continue to build inventory levels for preschool products in conjunction with executing the North American Strategy. Mattel intends to continue its plan to move towards more optimal accounts receivable and inventory levels through its focus on improving its supply chain performance. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by $102.1 million to $291.9 million at year end 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to increased prepaid income taxes and receivable collections deposits with banks. Property, plant and equipment, net decreased $21.1 million to $626.7 million at year end 2001, largely due to depreciation, partially offset by capital spending. Intangibles decreased $26.9 million to $1.1 billion at year end 2001, mainly due to goodwill amortization, partially offset by the acquisition of Pictionary(R) in June 2001. Other noncurrent assets declined by $54.3 million to $711.3 million at year end 2001, principally due to decreased noncurrent deferred tax assets. Short term borrowings decreased $188.3 million to $38.1 million at year end 2001 compared to $226.4 million at year end 2000, due to the repayment of debt. Current portion of long term debt increased by $177.4 million to $210.1 million at year end 2001, largely due to the reclassification of 200 million of Euro Notes from long term debt since they mature in July 2002. A summary of Mattels capitalization is as follows (in millions): As of Year End 2001 2000 Medium term notes................................... $ 480.0 17% $ 510.0 18% Senior notes........................................ 500.0 17 690.7 25 Other long term debt obligations.................... 40.9 1 41.7 1 Total long term debt................................ 1,020.9 35 1,242.4 44 Other long term liabilities......................... 184.2 6 165.5 6 Stockholders equity................................ 1,738.5 59 1,403.1 50 $2,943.6 100% $2,811.0 100% Total long term debt decreased by $221.5 million at year end 2001 compared to year end 2000 due to the aforementioned reclassification of 200 million of Euro Notes and $30.0 million of medium term notes maturing in the next twelve months to current portion of long term debt. Mattel expects to satisfy its future long term capital needs through the retention of corporate earnings and the issuance of long term debt instruments. Stockholders equity of $1.7 billion at year end 2001 increased $335.4 million from year end 2000, primarily as a result of income from continuing operations and cash received from exercise of employee stock options, partially offset by payment of common dividends and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. 28 Mattels total debt to capital ratio, including current portion of long term debt, improved from 52% at year end 2000 to 42% at year end 2001 due to the repayment of debt combined with improvement in its operating results. Mattel continues to target a goal of reducing the year end ratio to approximately one third of capital. Commitments In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into debt arrangements and contractual arrangements for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery, and to obtain and protect Mattels right to create and market certain products. These arrangements include commitments for future inventory purchases and licensing payments. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guaranteed or minimum expenditures during the term of the contracts. Mattels commitments for debt and other contractual arrangements is summarized as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total 2002 2003 2004 Thereafter Long term debt................. $1,231,009 $210,090 $380,849 $ 50,939 $589,131 Licensing minimums............. 379,000 106,000 84,000 81,000 108,000 Inventory purchases............ 121,000 121,000 Operating leases............... 168,100 38,800 29,800 26,800 72,700 Capitalized leases............. 10,100 300 300 300 9,200 Total.......................... $1,909,209 $476,190 $494,949 $159,039 $779,031 Discontinued Operations In May 1999, Mattel completed its merger with Learning Company, pursuant to which Learning Company was merged with and into Mattel, with Mattel being the surviving corporation. Due to substantial losses experienced in its Consumer Software segment, which was comprised primarily of Learning Company, Mattels board of directors, on March 31, 2000, resolved to dispose of its Consumer Software segment. As a result of this decision, the Consumer Software segment was reported as a discontinued operation effective March 31, 2000, and the consolidated financial statements were reclassified to segregate the net investment in, and the liabilities and operating results of the Consumer Software segment. On October 18, 2000, Mattel disposed of Learning Company to an affiliate of Gores Technology Group in return for a contractual right to receive future consideration based on income generated from its business operations and or the net proceeds derived by the new company upon the sale of its assets or other liquidation events, or 20% of its enterprise value at the end of five years. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Mattel received proceeds totaling $10.0 million from Gores Technology Group as a result of liquidation events related to Gores Technologys sale of the entertainment and education divisions. Mattel also incurred additional costs of approximately $10 million in 2001 related to the wind down of the Consumer Software segment. Accordingly, no income was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for discontinued operations. With respect to Gores Technology Groups disposition of the education division, there is additional contingent consideration that may be received by Mattel. At December 31, 2001, Mattel had net obligations related to its discontinued Consumer Software segment of approximately $24 million. Mattel believes that it has adequately reserved for future obligations of this segment. Any additional proceeds that are recognized will be recorded as part of the discontinued operations. In December 2000 and January 2001, Mattel entered into worldwide, multi year licensing agreements with Vivendi Universal Publishing and THQ, respectively, for the development and publishing of gaming, educational and productivity software based on Mattels brands, which Mattel had previously developed and 29 sold directly through its Mattel Media division. These partnerships allow Mattel to provide the content from its library of brands, while Vivendi Universal Publishing and THQ provide software development and distribution expertise. Litigation Litigation Related to Learning Company Following Mattels announcement in October 1999 of the expected results of its Learning Company division for the third quarter of 1999, several of Mattels stockholders filed purported class action complaints naming Mattel and certain of its present and former officers and directors as defendants. The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the defendants made false or misleading statements, in the joint proxy statement for the merger of Mattel and Learning Company and elsewhere, that artificially inflated the price of Mattels common stock. In March 2000, these shareholder complaints were consolidated into two lead cases: Thurber v. Mattel, Inc. et al. (containing claims under (S)10(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act ("Act")) and Dusek v. Mattel, Inc. et al (containing claims under (S)14(a) of the Act). In January 2001, the Court granted defendants motions to dismiss both Thurber and Dusek, and gave plaintiffs leave to amend. In December 2001, the Court denied defendants motions to dismiss the amended complaints in both Thurber and Dusek. In each case, the plaintiffs have asked for compensatory damages. Both Thurber and Dusek are currently pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Other purported class action litigation has been brought against Mattel as successor to Learning Company and the former directors of Learning Company on behalf of former stockholders of Broderbund Software, Inc. who acquired shares of Learning Company in exchange for their Broderbund common stock in connection with the Learning Company Broderbund merger on August 31, 1998. The consolidated complaint in In re Broderbund generally alleges that Learning Company misstated its financial results prior to the time it was acquired by Mattel. The defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in In re Broderbund was granted in May 2001, and the case was dismissed. The In re Broderbund plaintiffs appealed the dismissal, and the case is currently pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs have asked for compensatory damages. Several stockholders have filed derivative complaints on behalf and for the benefit of Mattel, alleging, among other things, that Mattels directors breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and grossly mismanaged Mattel in connection with Mattels acquisition of Learning Company and its approval of severance packages to certain former executives. These derivative actions have been filed in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, in Los Angeles Superior Court in California, and in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and are all in a preliminary stage. The plaintiffs have asked for unspecified monetary damages. Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in February 2002 in the California state court actions and defendants have filed a demurrer seeking dismissal of that action. Mattel believes that the actions are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. Environmental Fisher Price Fisher Price has executed a consent order with the State of New York to implement a groundwater remediation system at one of its former manufacturing plants. The execution of the consent order was in response to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Record of Decision issued in March 2000. The Department approved a conceptual work plan in March 2001, with work scheduled to begin in 2001. However, in response to concerns expressed by a number of nearby residents, the Department has requested that Mattel postpone implementation of the groundwater remediation plan until 2002 after the 30 installation of a public water line to those residents is completed. The ultimate liability associated with this cleanup presently is estimated to be approximately $1.76 million, approximately $1.26 million of which has been incurred through December 31, 2001. Beaverton, Oregon Mattel previously operated a manufacturing facility on a leased property in Beaverton, Oregon that was acquired as part of the March 1997 merger with Tyco. In March 1998, samples of groundwater used by the facility for process water and drinking water disclosed elevated levels of certain chemicals, including trichloroethylene. Mattel immediately closed the water supply and self reported the sample results to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Oregon Health Division. Mattel also implemented a community outreach program to employees, former employees and surrounding landowners. In November 1998, Mattel and another potentially responsible party entered into a consent order with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study at the property, to propose an interim remedial action measure, and to continue the community outreach program. Mattel has recorded pre tax charges totaling $19.0 million for environmental remediation costs related to this property, based on the completion and approval of the remediation plan and feasibility study. Approximately $3 million has been incurred through December 31, 2001, largely related to attorney fees, consulting work and an employee medical screening program. General Mattel is also involved in various other litigation and legal matters, including claims related to intellectual property, product liability and labor, which Mattel is addressing or defending in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that resolving such matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition or results of operations. Effects of Inflation Inflation rates in the US and in major foreign countries where Mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during the three years ended December 31, 2001. The US Consumer Price Index increased 1.6% in 2001, 3.4% in 2000 and 2.7% in 1999. Mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability to pass on higher prices to consumers. Employee Savings Plan Certain employee savings plan provisions used by other companies can result in requirements to hold substantial portions of a participants account balance in the stock of the sponsoring company, significantly increasing the exposure of the account to market risk associated with a single companys stock. However, the Mattel Personal Investment Plan is designed to allow participants to limit their exposure to market changes in Mattels stock price. Mattel makes company contributions in cash and allows employees to allocate both individual and company contributions to a balanced variety of investment funds. Furthermore, Mattels plan limits a participants allocation to the Mattel Stock Fund, which is fully invested in Mattel stock, to 50% of the account balance. Participants may generally reallocate their account balances on a daily basis. This reallocation is only limited for participants classified as insiders who wish to change their investment in the Mattel Stock Fund. Insiders are limited to certain window periods for making a reallocation out of or into the Mattel Stock Fund. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Mattel makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The accounting policies described below are those Mattel 31 considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements. These policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. However, as described below, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is a reserve used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. Mattels reserve is based on managements assessment of the business environment, customers financial condition, historical trends, receivable aging and customer disputes. Mattels allowance for doubtful accounts increased from approximately $25 million at year end 2000 to $56 million at year end 2001. In 2001, bad debt expense increased by approximately $40 million to $58 million. As more fully discussed in the section entitled "Results of Continuing Operations 2001 Compared to 2000 Consolidated Results," in the fourth quarter of 2001, Mattel recorded a $22.1 million charge related to the Kmart bankruptcy filing announced in January 2002. Mattel also recorded approximately $9 million in bad debt expense in the third quarter 2001, primarily related to the bankruptcy declared by a US retailer during the quarter. The remaining increase in bad debt expense was due to exposure associated with various other retailers. The difficult domestic retail environment has resulted in bankruptcies of large customers and represents the underlying cause for the increased bad debt expense in 2001. Mattel will continue to proactively review its credit risks and adjust its customer terms to reflect the current environment. The increased level of risk associated with credit given to customers may result in a continuation of bad debt charges at higher levels than historically experienced or lower sales. Inventories Inventories, net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow moving inventory. Mattels management uses estimates to record these reserves. Slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory. Changes in public and consumer preferences and demand for product or changes in the buying patterns and inventory management of customers, could adversely impact the inventory valuation. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets, identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets have been reviewed for impairment based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This statement requires that an impairment loss be recognized whenever the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use and ultimate disposal of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Mattels management reviews for indicators that might suggest an impairment loss exists. Testing long lived assets, identifiable intangibles and goodwill for recoverability requires estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from the use of the assets. Various uncertainties, including changes in consumer preferences, deterioration in the political situation in a country or adverse changes in the general economic conditions in the US and internationally, could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets. See discussion under "New Accounting Pronouncements" regarding SFAS No. 144, which supercedes SFAS No. 121 effective the first quarter of 2002. Deferred Tax Assets Mattel records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets. In determining the requisite allowance, management considers all available evidence for certain tax credit, net operating loss, and capital loss carryforwards that would likely expire prior to their utilization. Management believes that it is more likely than 32 not that Mattel will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets. However, if the available evidence were to change in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowances may be required. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 16, Business Combinations. This statement requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. The statement also requires unallocated negative goodwill to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain. The provisions of the statement apply to business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. For business combinations accounted for using the purchase method before July 1, 2001, the provisions of this statement will be effective in the first quarter of 2002. Mattel does not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 141 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. This statement addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. The statement also provides specific guidance on testing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142 provides that (i) goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized; (ii) impairment will be measured using various valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows; (iii) goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level; (iv) intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually; and (v) intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 were subjected to the provisions of this statement. All provisions of this statement will be effective in the first quarter of 2002. Mattels goodwill amortization was approximately $46 million of the total $51.1 million in amortization of intangibles recorded in 2001. Mattel is in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Based on preliminary results of its valuation study, Mattel anticipates that the total impairment to be recognized as a result of the transitional goodwill impairment test will be approximately $400 million pretax, relating entirely to the Pleasant Company reporting unit. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. All provisions of this statement will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2003. Mattel is in the process of determining the impact of this statement on its financial results when effective. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of and amends APB No. 30, Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. This statement requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell. SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121 for (a) recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and (b) measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. This statement also retains APB No. 30s requirement that companies report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations. All provisions of this statement will be effective in the first quarter of 2002. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on Mattels consolidated financial position and results of operations. 33 Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer, will be effective in the first quarter of 2002. This issue addresses (i) recognition, measurement, and income statement classification for sales incentives offered by a vendor without charge to a customer as a result of a single exchange transaction or as a result of attaining a specified cumulative level of transactions and (ii) whether certain consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendors products is an adjustment to selling prices or cost. The following table presents the quarterly and full year restated balances, excluding charges, resulting from the implementation of EITF No. 01 09 (in millions): First Second Third Fourth Full Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales..................... $715.2 $836.2 $1,575.3 $1,561.2 $4,687.9 Gross profit.................. 316.6 367.6 745.5 747.4 2,177.1 % of net sales................ 44.3% 44.0% 47.3% 47.9% 46.4% Advertising and promotion expenses..................... 79.4 84.9 174.9 204.0 543.2 Year Ended December 31, 2000 Net sales..................... $679.6 $803.0 $1,549.6 $1,533.3 $4,565.5 Gross profit.................. 299.9 348.3 703.7 719.9 2,071.8 % of net sales................ 44.1% 43.4% 45.4% 47.0% 45.4% Advertising and promotion expenses..................... 76.8 83.0 186.5 227.2 573.5 Year Ended December 31, 1999 Net sales..................... $676.0 $791.5 $1,557.4 $1,477.8 $4,502.7 Gross profit.................. 300.1 343.4 744.5 679.2 2,067.2 % of net sales................ 44.4% 43.4% 47.8% 46.0% 45.9% Advertising and promotion expenses..................... 75.9 80.6 185.3 227.9 569.7 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Risk Management Mattels results of operations and cash flows may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to market risk by monitoring its currency exchange exposure for the year and partially or fully hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory, and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts generally have maturity dates of up to 18 months. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings and intercompany invoicing. Mattels results of operations can also be affected by the translation of foreign revenues and earnings into US dollars. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2001, Mattel translated its Argentina peso denominated financial statements using the free floating market exchange rate as of January 11, 2002, of 1.6 pesos to the dollar. This translation did not have a significant impact on Mattels results of operations in 2001 and management believes that the devaluation will have minimal impact to its results of operations in 2002. Mattel entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to convert the interest rate and principal amount from Euros to US dollars on its 200 million Euro Notes due July 2002. Interest is payable annually at the rate of Euro 6.625%. The weighted average interest rate after the swap is 9.0% in US dollars. 34 Mattels foreign currency forward exchange contracts that were used to hedge firm foreign currency commitments as of December 31, 2001 are shown in the following table. All contracts are against the US dollar and are maintained by reporting units with a US dollar functional currency, with the exception of the Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht, Brazilian real and Venezuelan bolivar contracts that are maintained by entities with either a rupiah, baht, real or bolivar functional currency.

For the sale of foreign currencies, fair value reflects the amount, based on dealer quotes, that Mattel would receive at maturity for contracts involving the same currencies and maturity dates, if they had been entered into as of year end 2001. The differences between the fair value and the contract amounts are expected to be fully offset by foreign currency exchange gains and losses on the underlying hedged transactions. In addition to the contracts involving the US dollar detailed in the above table, Mattel also had contracts to sell British pounds sterling for the purchase of Euros. As of December 31, 2001, these contracts had a notional amount of $79.5 million and a fair value of $80.7 million. Had Mattel not entered into hedges to limit the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on results of operations and cash flows, pre tax income would have been reduced by approximately $10 million, $35 million, and $16 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. It also requires that gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. Mattel adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001. Mattel recorded a one time charge of approximately $12 million, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, for the transition adjustment related to the adoption of SFAS No. 133. Interest Rate Sensitivity An assumed 50 basis point movement in interest rates affecting Mattels variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial impact on its 2001 results of operations. 35
