Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Summary The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Mattels consolidated financial statements for all periods present the Consumer Software segment as a discontinued operation. See Discontinued Operations. Unless otherwise indicated, the following discussion relates only to Mattels continuing operations. Mattels consolidated statements of operations for 2001 and 2000 have been restated from the prior year presentation to classify interest income and other non operating expense, net below operating income to conform to the 2002 presentation. Additionally, Mattels consolidated statements of operations for 2001 and 2000 have been restated to include reclassifications of certain customer benefits and allowances to conform to the income statement requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer. Effective January 2002, Mattel ceased amortization of its goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. To facilitate the comparison of current year segment results to that of the prior year, the segment income was restated from prior year presentation to exclude goodwill amortization. In February 2003, Mattel announced the consolidation of its US Girls and US Boys Entertainment segments into one segment, renamed Mattel Brands. Additionally, Pleasant Company, which was previously part of the US Girls segment, is now a separate segment for management reporting purposes in 2003. Any discussion of segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is based on the segments evaluated by management during 2002. Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide through sales to retailers (i.e., customers) and directly to consumers. Mattels business is dependent in great part on its ability each year to redesign, restyle and extend existing core products and product lines, to design and develop innovative new products and product lines, and successfully to market those products and product lines. Mattel plans to continue to focus on its portfolio of traditional brands that have historically had worldwide sustainable appeal, to create new brands utilizing its knowledge of childrens play patterns and to target customer and consumer preferences around the world. Mattel also intends to expand its core brands through the Internet, and licensing and entertainment partnerships. Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories: Girls including Barbie&reg; fashion dolls and accessories, Polly Pocket!&reg;, Diva Starz, Whats Her Face!, ello, and American Girl&reg; Boys Entertainment including Hot Wheels&reg;, Matchbox&reg;, and Tyco&reg; Radio Control vehicles and playsets (collectively Wheels), and Nickelodeon&reg;, Harry Potter, Yu Gi Oh!, He Man&reg; and Masters of the Universe&reg;, and games and puzzles (collectively Entertainment) Infant & Preschool including Fisher Price&reg;, Power Wheels&reg;, Sesame Street&reg;, Disney preschool and plush, Winnie the Pooh, Blues Clues, Rescue Heroes, Barney, See N Say&reg;, Magna Doodle&reg;, Dora the Explorer, and View Master&reg; Results of Continuing Operations 2002 Compared to 2001 Consolidated Results Income from continuing operations for 2002 was $455.0 million or $1.03 per diluted share as compared to income from continuing operations of $310.9 million or $0.71 per diluted share in 2001. Profitability in 2002 was impacted by a pre tax charge of $48.3 million ($31.9 million after tax) related to the financial realignment plan. Profitability in 2001 was impacted by a pre tax charge of $50.2 million ($35.2 million after tax) related to the 16 financial realignment plan and a $5.5 million after tax charge related to loss on derivative instruments. Included in the reported results for 2001 was a pre tax goodwill amortization charge of $46.1 million ($34.7 million after tax). The combined effect of these items resulted in an after tax charge totaling $75.4 million. Mattel faced several challenges during 2002, in its largest market, the US, including an uncertain retail environment, weak consumer confidence, higher unemployment, labor unrest at West Coast ports and the threat of continued terrorism and war. These factors caused most of Mattels customers to have actual sales performance below expectations and several customers announced store closures and reorganization plans. Mattel improved its performance despite these challenges by executing four strategic priorities: (i) strengthening core brand momentum; (ii) executing the financial realignment plan and cutting costs; (iii) improving supply chain performance; and (iv) developing people. As retailers continued to focus on just in time inventory management, Mattel improved the alignment of its shipment of product to retailers with consumer demand. This strategy resulted in a higher proportion of US shipments occurring in the second half of the year when consumer demand peaks. As in 2002, Mattel anticipates that this initiative will put downward pressure on first half 2003 US shipments, but should have no impact on full year sales. Additionally, as part of the financial realignment plan, Mattel lowered costs by closing and consolidating certain of its manufacturing and distribution facilities and reducing headcount at its US based headquarters locations. Mattel expects that the challenging retail and consumer environment will likely continue in 2003. To optimize its business and mitigate the impact of the aforementioned challenges, Mattel intends to continue its emphasis in 2003 on the following strategic initiatives: Core brands focusing on traditional core brand categories, extending product lines, initiating core brand promotional programs and targeting profitable licensing arrangements. Channels strengthening relationships with retailers, providing quality service to customers and optimizing its supply chain. Costs controlling costs to help mitigate the impact of anticipated rising commodity, transportation, employee benefits, and insurance costs. Cash generating and opportunistically deploying cash using a disciplined approach. The following table provides a comparison of the reported results for 2002 and 2001 along with charges related to the financial realignment plan, 2001 goodwill amortization and other nonrecurring charges (in millions): For the Year 2002 2001 Reported Results Charges Reported Results Charges & Goodwill Net sales $ 4,885.3 $ $ 4,687.9 $ Gross profit $ 2,361.0 $ (10.4 ) $ 2,148.9 $ (28.2 ) Advertising and promotion expenses 552.5 543.6 0.3 Other selling and administrative expenses 1,050.3 13.3 964.2 6.0 Amortization of goodwill 46.1 46.1 Restructuring and other charges 24.6 24.6 15.7 15.7 Operating income 733.6 (48.3 ) 579.3 (96.3 ) Interest expense 113.9 155.1 Interest (income) (17.7 ) (15.5 ) Other non operating expense, net 15.9 9.7 5.5 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 621.5 $ (48.3 ) $ 430.0 $ (101.8 ) 17 Net sales from continuing operations for 2002 increased 4% to $4.9 billion, from $4.7 billion in 2001. Gross sales within the US increased 1% from 2001 and accounted for 64% of consolidated gross sales in 2002 compared to 67% in 2001. In 2002, gross sales internationally increased 12% from 2001. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange, international gross sales were up 11% compared to 2001. Mattels strategic focus on globalization of brands is one of the primary drivers for continued growth in the International segment. Management expects that sales growth internationally will continue to outpace US sales growth for the foreseeable future. Worldwide gross sales in the Girls category increased 6%, or 5% in local currency, to $2.3 billion in 2002. Domestic sales declined by 2% and international sales increased by 18%, or 16% in local currency. Sales growth in Barbie&reg; internationally, Polly Pocket!&reg;, Whats Her Face!, and American Girl&reg; was partially offset by declines in US Barbie&reg;, Diva Starz and large dolls. The discontinuation of Cabbage Patch Kids&reg; in 2002 contributed to the decrease in total large doll sales. Worldwide Barbie&reg; sales were up 6% in 2002, reflecting an increase of 16% in international sales and a decline of 2% in domestic sales. The decline in domestic sales for Barbie&reg; was driven by the strategic initiative to reduce shipments of adult targeted collector and holiday dolls. Barbie&reg; holiday doll shipments in 2002 were approximately one half the amount shipped in 2001. Excluding these adult targeted lines, domestic Barbie&reg; sales increased 2% in 2002. Worldwide gross sales in the Boys Entertainment category grew 2%, to $1.3 billion. Domestic sales remained flat with 2001, while international sales increased by 6%, or 7% in local currency. The worldwide Wheels business increased 3% due to growth in Matchbox&reg; products and increased international sales of Hot Wheels&reg; and Tyco&reg; Radio Control brands. Domestic Wheels sales declined by 2% and international sales grew by 13%. The worldwide Entertainment business grew 2%, reflecting strong sales from licensed properties such as He Man&reg; and Masters of the Universe&reg;, Yu Gi Oh!, and SpongeBob SquarePants lines, and games and puzzles, which more than offset the elimination of Disney entertainment properties and a decline in Harry Potter sales. In July 2002, Mattel and Warner Bros. Consumer Products announced comprehensive, multi year agreements granting Mattel master toy licenses for several of Warner Bros. core franchises, including Looney Tunes, Baby Looney Tunes, Batman, Superman and Justice League. The agreements, which took effect in January 2003, cover all global territories except Asia and include rights to market products based on any related theatrical releases or television programs that are produced during the period covered by the agreements. Worldwide gross sales in the Infant & Preschool category increased 5%, or 4% in local currency, to $1.7 billion. Domestic sales increased by 3% and international sales were up 10%, or 7% in local currency. Growth in sales of core Fisher Price&reg; and Power Wheels&reg; products was partially offset by a decline in licensed character brands in both domestic and international markets. Strong sales of Baby Gear, Rescue Heroes and Little People&reg; lines contributed to the increase in core Fisher Price&reg; sales. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 48.3% in 2002 compared to 45.8% in 2001. Gross profit was positively impacted by savings realized from the financial realignment plan and supply chain initiatives. Specifically, gross profit benefited from lower commodity and logistics costs, reduced manufacturing overhead costs, lower material costs due to improved design and engineering processes, and lower product costs due to movement of production to Mexico and Asia. In 2003, Mattel expects increases in commodity and logistics costs may have a negative impact on its gross profit, mitigated in part or wholly by further progress in its supply chain and procurement initiatives. Cost of sales in 2002 includes a $10.4 million financial realignment plan charge, largely related to the closure of the Murray, Kentucky, manufacturing and distribution facilities (North American Strategy). Cost of sales in 2001 includes a $28.2 million financial realignment plan charge, largely related to the North American Strategy and termination of a licensing agreement. Advertising and promotion expense was 11.3% of net sales for 2002, compared to 11.6% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 was largely due to lower prices charged by media companies on a cost per rating point basis. Mattel expects advertising and promotion expense as a percentage of net sales for 2003 will rise, reflecting a combination of media prices leveling off and Mattels plan for increased spending to support the launch of several new product lines. 18 Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.1 billion or 21.5% of net sales in 2002 compared to $964.2 million or 20.6% of net sales in 2001. Other selling and administrative expenses increased in 2002 primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals of approximately $63 million. Mattels incentive compensation plans are based on net operating profit after taxes less a capital charge, and substantial progress was made in improving this metric since 2001. Other selling and administrative expenses also increased due to financial realignment plan charges of $13.3 million in 2002 compared to $6.0 million in 2001, largely associated with streamlining back office functions and asset writedowns and other costs associated with implementing the North American Strategy. Offsetting the increase in other selling and administrative expenses were cost savings resulting from continued execution of the financial realignment plan and tight management of costs. Total bad debt expense was $53.4 million in 2002 compared to $57.7 million in 2001. Each quarter, management evaluates Mattels credit exposure as it relates to all of its customers. Considering this review, Mattel recorded an additional $33.5 million adjustment in 2002 to write down the Kmart pre bankruptcy petition accounts receivable. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Mattel recorded an initial $22.1 million charge related to the bankruptcy filing of Kmart in January 2002 and approximately $9 million in bad debt expense in the third quarter of 2001, largely related to the bankruptcy declared by another US retailer. To estimate the net realizable value of the Kmart pre bankruptcy petition accounts receivable, management considered the current post petition market price for the Kmart bank debt, bonds and trade receivables at the end of each quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Mattel decided to sell its Kmart pre bankruptcy petition accounts receivable and, accordingly, wrote them down to liquidation value. Mattels remaining pre bankruptcy petition net accounts receivable from Kmart at December 31, 2002, after offsetting the reserve for customer benefits that were not earned by Kmart, was $2.7 million. The $2.7 million reflects Mattels best estimate of the net realizable value of its pre bankruptcy petition trade claim as of December 31, 2002, considering the actual proceeds Mattel received upon the sale of this trade claim in March 2003 to an unrelated third party. The following is a summary of the activity related to Mattels net Kmart pre bankruptcy petition accounts receivable balance through December 31, 2002 (in millions): Gross Kmart accounts receivable before bankruptcy filing $ 73.1 Balance of reserve, reclamation claim and unearned customer benefits accrued at time of Kmarts bankruptcy filing $ (14.8 ) Writedown for bad debt recorded in 2001 (22.1 ) Writedown for bad debt recorded in 2002 (33.5 ) Total reserves and unearned customer benefits at December 31, 2002 (70.4 ) Net Kmart pre bankruptcy petition accounts receivable at December 31, 2002 $ 2.7 Non Operating Items Interest expense was $113.9 million in 2002 compared to $155.1 million in 2001 due to lower average borrowings resulting from improvements in working capital and higher cash at the beginning of the year, repayment of approximately $422 million in long term debt, and lower short term interest rates. Interest income was $17.7 million in 2002 compared to $15.5 million in 2001. Other non operating expense, net was $15.9 million in 2002 versus $9.7 million in 2001. Included in 2002 was a $25.4 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter resulting from the settlement of shareholder litigation related to the 1999 acquisition of the Learning Company.
