Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Mattels consolidated financial statements for all periods present the Consumer Software segment as a discontinued operation. See Discontinued Operations. Unless otherwise indicated, the following discussion relates only to Mattels continuing operations. Overview Mattel designs, manufactures and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide through sales to its customers and directly to consumers. Mattels business is dependent in great part on its ability each year to redesign, restyle and extend existing core products and product lines, to design and develop innovative new products and product lines, and to successfully market those products and product lines. Mattel plans to continue to focus on its portfolio of traditional brands that have historically had worldwide appeal, to create new brands utilizing its knowledge of childrens play patterns and to target customer and consumer preferences around the world. Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories: Mattel Brands including Barbie&reg; fashion dolls and accessories (Barbie&reg;), Polly Pocket! and Disney Classics (collectively Other Girls Brands), Hot Wheels&reg;, Matchbox&reg; and Tyco&reg; R/C vehicles and playsets (collectively Wheels) and Harry Potter, Yu Gi Oh!, Batman, Justice League, Megaman and games and puzzles (collectively Entertainment). Fisher Price Brands including Fisher Price&reg;, Little People&reg;, Rescue Heroes&reg;, BabyGear and View Master&reg; (collectively Core Fisher Price&reg;), Sesame Street&reg;, Barney, Dora the Explorer, Winnie the Pooh, InteracTV and See N Say&reg; (collectively Fisher Price&reg; Friends) and Power Wheels&reg;. American Girl Brands including American Girl Today&reg;, The American Girls Collection&reg; and Bitty Baby&reg;. American Girl Brands products are sold directly to consumers and its childrens publications are also sold to certain retailers. Management believes that the business environment for Mattel in 2005 will be similar to that of 2004. Mattel expects to continue facing challenges both domestically and internationally as retailers continue to rationalize stores and prioritize inventory management. Management also expects to encounter continued cost pressures in the areas of product costs, including oil based resin, transportation costs, and employee related costs. Management has established two overarching goals for 2005. The first goal is to drive growth by continuing the invigoration of the Barbie&reg; brand, while maintaining growth in all of its core brands by continuing to develop innovative toys. Mattel also plans on generating growth by focusing on more effectively aligning with growing retail customers and continuing to develop new channels. The second goal is to gain further efficiencies in the supply chain by implementing new spend management and e procurement policies, procedures and information systems; and rationalizing manufacturing and vendor sourcing. 16 Table of Contents Results of Continuing Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2004 were $5.10 billion, a 3% increase compared to $4.96 billion in 2003, including a benefit from changes in currency exchange rates of 2 percentage points. Net income for 2004 was $572.7 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $537.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, for 2003. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 49.0% in 2003 to 47.2% in 2004. Sales of lower margin products, including the impact of sales mix, value enhancement initiatives, change in classification of close out sales, higher royalty costs and ongoing external cost pressures were the primary drivers for the decline in gross profit. Income generated from continuing operations before income taxes declined in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in 2004 compared to 2003. Contributing to this decline was a pre tax charge of $16.2 million, primarily related to the elimination of approximately 285 positions as a result of headcount reductions at certain domestic and international locations, and integration of the Matchbox&reg; and Tyco&reg; R/C business located in New Jersey into the Hot Wheels&reg; business in California to take advantage of synergies in the Wheels business. These increased costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of investments, net favorable legal settlements and a positive benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. A settlement with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) resulted in a net benefit of $65.1 million in the 2004 provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. Net income for 2003 included a pre tax charge of $26.3 million ($20.0 million after tax) related to the financial realignment plan, which was completed in 2003. In 2003, Mattel also recognized pre tax income of $7.9 million ($5.0 million after tax) representing an adjustment to a reserve accrued in 1999 associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Beaverton, Oregon. The combined effect of these items was a net after tax charge of $15.0 million for 2003. Shares repurchased under Mattels share repurchase program resulted in a benefit to Mattels earnings per share in 2004 when compared to 2003, by reducing the average number of common shares outstanding. Since inception of the share repurchase program in July 2003, Mattel has repurchased 27.4 million shares, representing 6% of common shares outstanding. In the second quarter of 2004, a major thunderstorm damaged a Mattel distribution center located in Texas, which warehouses and distributes finished product for Mattel. Mattel carried insurance for this risk and in the fourth quarter of 2004, Mattel settled its claim with its insurance carrier. This event had no material impact on the results of operations for 2004. The following table provides a summary of Mattels consolidated results for 2004 and 2003 (in millions, except percentage and basis point information): For the Year 2004 2003 Year/Year Change Amount % of NetSales Amount % of NetSales % Basis Points of Net Sales Net sales $ 5,102.8 100.0 % $ 4,960.1 100.0 % 3 % Gross profit $ 2,410.7 47.2 % $ 2,429.5 49.0 % 1 % (180 ) Advertising and promotion expenses 643.0 12.6 636.1 12.8 1 % (20 ) Other selling and administrative expenses 1,036.9 20.3 1,002.9 20.3 3 % Restructuring and other charges 4.8 0.1 100 % (10 ) Operating income 730.8 14.3 785.7 15.8 7 % (150 ) Interest expense 77.8 1.5 80.6 1.6 3 % Interest (income) (19.7 ) 0.4 (18.9 ) 0.4 4 % Other non operating (income), net (23.5 ) 0.4 (16.8 ) 0.3 40 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 696.2 13.6 % $ 740.8 14.9 % 6 % (130 ) 17 Table of Contents Sales Net sales for 2004 were $5.10 billion, a 3% increase compared to $4.96 billion in 2003, including a benefit from changes in currency exchange rates of 2 percentage points. Gross sales within the US remained flat with 2003 and accounted for 58% of consolidated gross sales in 2004 compared to 60% in 2003. In 2004, gross sales in international markets increased 7% compared to 2003, including a benefit from changes in currency exchange rates of 5 percentage points. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Mattel changed the way certain close out sales are classified in its consolidated statement of income. Close out sales are sales of certain products that are no longer included in current product lines. These sales were previously classified as a reduction of cost of sales. Effective October 1, 2003, close out sales are reported as net sales in Mattels consolidated statements of income. This change in classification had no impact on gross profit, net income, net income per common share, balance sheets or cash flows for any date or period presented. For the fourth quarter of 2003, close out sales, which were included in reported net sales, were $19.2 million. In 2004, close out sales represented 80 basis points of sales growth for the year, and had a negative impact on gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 40 basis points. For the first three quarters of 2003, close out sales classified as a reduction of cost of sales were $38.1 million. See Item 6 Selected Financial Data and
