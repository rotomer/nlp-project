Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Mattel designs, manufactures and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide through sales to its customers and directly to consumers. Mattels business is dependent in great part on its ability each year to redesign, restyle and extend existing core products and product lines, to design and develop innovative new products and product lines, and to successfully market those products and product lines. Mattel plans to continue to focus on its portfolio of traditional brands that have historically had worldwide appeal, to create new brands utilizing its knowledge of childrens play patterns and to target customer and consumer preferences around the world. Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories: Mattel Girls & Boys Brands including Barbie&reg; fashion dolls and accessories (Barbie&reg;), Polly Pocket! and Disney Classics (collectively Other Girls Brands), Hot Wheels&reg;, Matchbox&reg; and Tyco&reg; R/C vehicles and playsets (collectively Wheels) and Harry Potter, Yu Gi Oh!, Batman, Justice League, MegaMan and games and puzzles (collectively Entertainment). Fisher Price Brands including Fisher Price&reg;, Little People&reg;, Rescue Heroes&reg;, BabyGear and View Master&reg; (collectively Core Fisher Price&reg;), Sesame Street&reg;, Barney, Dora the Explorer, Winnie the Pooh, InteracTV and See N Say&reg; (collectively Fisher Price&reg; Friends) and Power Wheels&reg;. American Girl Brands including Just Like You, the historical collection and Bitty Baby&reg;. American Girl Brands products are sold directly to consumers and its childrens publications are also sold to certain retailers. On October 10, 2005, Mattel announced the consolidation of its domestic Mattel Girls & Boys Brands and Fisher Price Brands divisions into one division. The creation of the new Mattel Brands division, which will 22 Table of Contents result in the consolidation of some management and support functions, is expected to more effectively and efficiently leverage Mattels scale, and will preserve the natural marketing and design groups that are empowered to create and market toys based on gender and age groups. These changes are consistent with Mattels ongoing strategy to build brands, cut costs and develop people in a streamlined organization that is focused on scale, innovation and execution. In connection with this consolidation, Mattel began executing an initiative in 2006 to streamline its workforce, primarily in El Segundo, California. It is expected that this initiative will result in a net reduction of over 200 positions, expenses of approximately $10 to $13 million, and will be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2006. The consolidation of these divisions does not change Mattels operating segments. Management believes that the business environment for Mattel in 2006 will be similar to that of 2005. Mattel expects to continue facing challenges both domestically and internationally as certain retailers continue to rationalize stores and tightly manage inventory. In 2005, sales increases across much of Mattels portfolio were partially offset by declines in the Barbie&reg; brand. Additionally, Mattel has experienced continued cost pressures in the areas of product costs, including oil based resin, the impact of the strengthening of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar, transportation costs, and employee related costs. Management believes that Mattel will continue to encounter a challenging retail environment, along with cost pressures and the possibility of continued sales declines in the Barbie&reg; brand. Mattels objective is to continue to create long term shareholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established two overarching goals. The first goal is to drive sales growth by reinvigorating the Barbie&reg; brand, while maintaining growth in other core brands by continuing to develop innovative toys. Managements principal strategies for driving sales growth are as follows: (i) focusing on Mattels core brands and core markets; (ii) aligning more effectively with growing retail customers by building closer partnerships with these customers around the world; (iii) investing in developing markets; (iv) expanding its presence in categories in which Mattel does not currently have an extensive presence; and (v) growing alternative sales channels. Additionally, Mattel plans to pursue additional licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to extend its portfolio of brands into areas outside of traditional toys. The second goal is to continue rationalizing manufacturing and vendor sourcing to reduce the cost of manufacturing, purchasing and distributing Mattels products, and improve Mattels cost structure by gaining further efficiencies in the supply chain through implementation of new spend management and e procurement policies, procedures and information systems, as well as Lean manufacturing principles, a management philosophy focused on reduction of wastes in manufactured products. Results of Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2005 were $5.18 billion, a 1% increase compared to $5.10 billion in 2004, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2005 was $417.0 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $572.7 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for 2004. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 47.2% in 2004 to 45.8% in 2005. Higher external cost pressures, higher sales of lower margin products, including the impact of sales mix, and higher royalty costs were the primary drivers for the decline in gross profit, partially offset by a moderate price increase implemented in January 2005 and favorable changes in currency exchange rates. Income before income taxes declined as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared to 2004. Contributing to this decline were overall lower gross margins, higher selling, general and administrative costs due to upward cost pressures for employee related expenses and ongoing investments in growth strategies including new product 23 Table of Contents design and expansion of our American Girl Place&reg; retail stores, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, lower advertising expenses and favorable changes in currency exchange rates. Income before income taxes in 2004 was negatively impacted by a pre tax charge of $16.2 million, primarily related to the elimination of approximately 285 positions as a result of headcount reductions, and integration of the Matchbox&reg; and Tyco&reg; R/C business into the Hot Wheels&reg; business in California, partially offset by net favorable legal settlements. Net income in 2005 was negatively impacted by incremental tax expense of $107.0 million resulting from Mattels decision to repatriate $2.4 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings under AJCA, partially offset by $38.6 million of tax benefit primarily relating to audit settlements with certain tax authorities in both the US and abroad. Net income in 2004 was positively impacted by a $65.1 million tax benefit related to an audit settlement with the IRS. Shares repurchased under Mattels share repurchase program resulted in a benefit to Mattels earnings per share in 2005 when compared to 2004, by reducing the average number of common shares outstanding. Since inception of the share repurchase program in July 2003, Mattel has repurchased 56.3 million shares, representing 13% of common shares outstanding.

Gross sales within the US decreased 2% from 2004 and accounted for 56% of consolidated gross sales in 2005 compared to 58% in 2004. In 2005, gross sales in international markets increased 5% compared to 2004, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands decreased 3% to $3.14 billion in 2005 compared to 2004, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales decreased 10% and international gross sales increased 3%, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Barbie&reg; decreased 13% from 2004, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales of Barbie&reg; decreased 21% and international gross sales of Barbie&reg; decreased 7%, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 25% from 2004, including a 1 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by sales of Disney Princesses, Pound Puppies and Pixel Chix worldwide, and Winx Club in international markets. Worldwide 24 Table of Contents gross sales in the Wheels category decreased 1% compared to 2004, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. International gross sales increases in the Hot Wheels&reg; and Tyco&reg; R/C product lines were more than offset by sales declines in the US. Worldwide gross sales in the Entertainment category were flat with the prior year, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. In the Entertainment category, growth in worldwide sales of Batman products was partially offset by sales declines in Yu Gi Oh! and Harry Potter worldwide, and JuiceBox in the US. Worldwide gross sales of Fisher Price Brands increased 5% to $2.02 billion in 2005 compared to 2004, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales increased 3%, while international gross sales grew low double digits. Worldwide gross sales of Core Fisher Price&reg; increased 1% compared to 2004, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by infant products and continued growth in the BabyGear line internationally. Worldwide gross sales of Fisher Price&reg; Friends increased 18% compared to 2004, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates, mainly attributable to the continued strength of the Dora the Explorer property. Gross sales of American Girl Brands increased 15% to $436.1 million in 2005 compared 2004, primarily due to continued strong performance of the American Girl Place&reg; retail stores and the direct channels, driven by the success of the Marisol doll and book from the Just Like You contemporary line, and doll and book products related to the American Girl&reg; live action, made for TV movies. Gross Profit Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.8% in 2005 compared to 47.2% in 2004. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, resulted from higher external cost pressures, higher sales of lower margin products, including the impact of sales mix, and higher royalty costs. These factors were partially offset by favorable changes in currency exchange rates and a moderate price increase implemented in January 2005. Advertising and Promotion Expenses Advertising and promotion expenses were 12.1% of net sales in 2005, compared to 12.6% in 2004. Mattel expects advertising spending levels for 2006 to be fairly consistent with its 11% 13% historical range to support its plan to invest in the business to drive long term performance. Other Selling and Administrative Expenses Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.08 billion in 2005, or 20.8% of net sales, compared to $1.04 billion in 2004, or 20.3% of net sales. Other selling and administrative expenses increased in 2005, primarily due to the following: Higher external cost pressures and employee related costs; Investments in growth initiatives including new product design and development and higher overhead costs in 2005 associated with the American Girl Place&reg; retail store in Los Angeles that will open in 2006; and Net favorable legal settlements in 2004 that did not recur in 2005. The consolidation of its Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US and Fisher Price Brands US divisions into one division included the elimination of executive level positions and resulted in severance charges totaling $7.1 million in 2005, of which $6.1 million resulted from the elimination of the position of president of the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands US division. The overall increase in other selling and administrative expenses was partially offset by a $16.2 million charge for severance in 2004 related to the elimination of approximately 285 positions, resulting from headcount reductions and the relocation of the Matchbox&reg; and Tyco&reg; R/C brands from New Jersey to California and lower incentive compensation in 2005. 25 Table of Contents Non Operating Items Interest expense decreased from $77.8 million in 2004 to $76.5 million in 2005 due to lower average debt in 2005, partially offset by higher average short term borrowing rates. Interest income increased from $19.7 million in 2004 to $34.2 million in 2005, primarily as a result of higher interest rates. Other non operating (income), net was $29.8 million in 2005, comprised mainly of a $25.8 million gain from the sale of marketable securities. Other non operating (income), net was $23.5 million in 2004, comprised mainly of a $22.1 million gain from the sale of marketable securities. As of December 31, 2005, Mattel held no marketable securities. As of December 31, 2004, the pre tax unrealized gains on marketable securities held by Mattel were $26.1 million ($16.4 million after tax). Provision for Income Taxes Net income in 2005 was negatively impacted by incremental tax expense of $107.0 million, resulting from Mattels decision to repatriate $2.4 billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings under AJCA and was positively impacted by $38.6 million of tax benefit relating to audit settlements with certain tax authorities and the reassessment of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in both the U.S. and abroad. Net income in 2004 was positively impacted by a $65.1 million tax benefit related to an audit settlement with the IRS.
