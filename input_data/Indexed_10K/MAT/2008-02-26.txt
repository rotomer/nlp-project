Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide through sales to its customers and directly to consumers. Mattels business is dependent in great part on its ability each year to redesign, restyle, and extend existing core products and product lines, to design and develop innovative new products and product lines, and to successfully market those products and product lines. Mattel plans to continue to focus on its portfolio of traditional brands that have historically had worldwide appeal, to create new brands utilizing its knowledge of childrens play patterns, and to target customer and consumer preferences around the world. Mattels portfolio of brands and products are grouped in the following categories: Mattel Girls & Boys Brands including Barbie&reg; fashion dolls and accessories (Barbie&reg;), Polly Pocket&reg;, Little Mommy&reg;, Disney Classics, Pixel Chix&reg;, and High School Musical (collectively Other Girls Brands), Hot Wheels&reg;, Matchbox&reg;, and Tyco&reg; R/C vehicles and playsets (collectively Wheels), and CARS, Radica&reg; products, and games and puzzles (collectively Entertainment). Fisher Price Brands including Fisher Price&reg;, Little People&reg;, BabyGear, and View Master&reg; (collectively Core Fisher Price&reg;), Sesame Street&reg;, Dora the Explorer, Winnie the Pooh, Go Diego Go!, and See N Say&reg; (collectively Fisher Price&reg; Friends), and Power Wheels&reg;. American Girl Brands including Just Like You&reg;, the historical collection and Bitty Baby&reg;. American Girl Brands products are sold directly to consumers, and its childrens publications are also sold to certain retailers. On October 10, 2005, Mattel announced the consolidation of its domestic Mattel Girls & Boys Brands and Fisher Price Brands divisions into one division. The creation of the Mattel Brands division, which resulted in the consolidation of some management and support functions, preserves the natural marketing and design groups that are empowered to create and market toys based on gender and age groups and is expected to more effectively and efficiently leverage Mattels scale. These changes are consistent with Mattels ongoing goals to enhance innovation and improve execution. In connection with this consolidation, Mattel executed an initiative in 2006 to streamline its workforce, primarily in El Segundo, California. The consolidation of these divisions did not change Mattels operating segments. Management believes that the business environment for Mattel in 2008 will be similar to that of 2007. Mattel expects to continue facing challenges both domestically and internationally as retailers continue to tightly manage inventory. Additionally, Mattel has experienced continued cost pressures, including higher product costs for commodities, labor, and foreign currency. Management believes that Mattel will continue to encounter a challenging retail environment, along with cost pressures. Additionally, in 2008, Mattel will incur higher product testing costs and, until all recall related legal matters are resolved, additional legal expenses. Mattels objective is to continue to create long term shareholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established three overarching goals. The first goal is to enhance innovation in order to reinvigorate the Barbie&reg; brand, while maintaining growth in other core brands by continuing to develop popular toys. Additionally, Mattel plans to pursue additional licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to extend its portfolio of brands into areas outside of traditional toys. 28 The second goal is to improve execution in areas including manufacturing, distribution, and selling. Mattel continues to focus on improving the efficiency of its supply chain using Lean supply chain initiatives. The objective of the Lean program is to improve the flow of processes, do more with less, and focus on the value chain from beginning to end. The third goal is to further capitalize on Mattels scale advantage. For example, as the worlds largest toy company, Mattel believes it can realize cost savings when making purchasing decisions based on a One Mattel philosophy. Product Recalls and Withdrawals During the third quarter of 2007, Mattel recalled products with high powered magnets that may become dislodged and other products, some of which were produced using non approved paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory and Mattel standards (collectively, the Third Quarter of 2007 Recalls). Additional products were recalled, withdrawn from retail stores, or replaced at the request of consumers in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of small parts separating from a product, some instances of paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory standards in another product, and the presence of lead in the substrate in excess of an Illinois regulatory standard in other products (collectively, along with the Third Quarter of 2007 Recalls, the 2007 Product Recalls). As a result of the Third Quarter of 2007 Recalls, Mattel intentionally slowed down its shipments out of Asia while it conducted extensive product testing in the third quarter of 2007. Also, export licenses at several manufacturing facilities in China were temporarily suspended in September 2007 while safety procedures were reviewed, but all licenses were in place at December 31, 2007. Mattels ability to import products into certain countries was also temporarily impacted by product recalls as certain countries and regulatory authorities reviewed Mattels safety procedures; however, these import and export issues were largely resolved early in the fourth quarter of 2007 and did not have a significant financial impact on Mattels 2007 results. The third quarter of 2007 recall of products with high powered magnets was a recall of older toys that do not meet Mattels current magnet retention system requirements. Since November 2006, when Mattel conducted its first voluntary recall for magnetic toys, Mattel has implemented enhanced magnet retention systems across all of its brands. At the beginning of 2007, all magnets must be locked into the plastic toy with sturdy material holding in the edges around the exposed face of the magnet or completely covering or encapsulating the magnet. Mattel also conducted an extensive review of technical data and consumer information on all magnetic toys and is confident in the new requirements, based on its continued testing and consumer experience. In July 2007, Mattel determined that certain products, manufactured by a third party contract manufacturer in China, were produced using non approved paint containing lead in excess of applicable regulatory standards. As a result, and also in July 2007, Mattel launched a thorough investigation and expanded its testing programs to ensure that painted finished goods, at third party contract manufacturers as well as facilities operated by Mattel, are systematically tested prior to being shipped to customers. The expanded testing programs include a check system to enforce compliance with all regulations and standards applicable to lead paint. Mattel has also created a new Corporate Responsibility organization, which has an even greater level of accountability internally and externally for adherence to the companys safety and compliance protocols. Although management is not aware of any additional significant issues associated with lead in paints used on, or lead in substrate used in, its products, there can be no assurance that additional issues will not be identified in the future. Mattel believes that it has some of the most rigorous quality and safety testing procedures in the toy industry. Management also believes that Mattels history of acting responsibly and quickly will maintain the trust of its customers and consumers. However, the 2007 Product Recalls may have a negative impact on both customer and consumer demand for Mattels products in the future. 29 Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2007 were $5.97 billion, a 6% increase as compared to $5.65 billion in 2006, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2007 was $600.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $592.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, for 2006. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 46.5% in 2007 from 46.2% in 2006. The increase in gross profit was driven by price increases and favorable changes in currency exchange rates, which were partially offset by external cost pressures and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which reduced gross profit by approximately $71 million. Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales declined to 11.8% in 2007 from 12.1% in 2006. Contributing to this decline were higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and higher advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by higher gross margins, lower interest expense, and higher other non operating income. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses in 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased other selling and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million. Higher investments in the business, including design and development costs and expansion in international markets, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increases in employee related costs, and the inclusion of Radica costs also contributed to the increase. These costs increases were partially offset by lower 2007 incentive and equity compensation expenses. Other selling and administrative expenses in 2006 included $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors. Other non operating income, net increased from $4.3 million in 2006 to $11.0 million in 2007, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains. Net income in 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million due to reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes. Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May 2006 and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of multiple ongoing audits by foreign and state tax authorities.

The 2007 Product Recalls reduced net sales by approximately $48.9 million for sales returns and reserves recorded in 2007. Gross sales in international markets increased 17% as compared to 2006, including a 7 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Gross sales within the US decreased 1% from 2006, and accounted for 51% and 56% of consolidated gross sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Worldwide gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands increased 8% to $3.70 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, including a 5 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands decreased 4% and international gross sales of Mattel Girls & Boys Brands increased 18%, including an 8 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Barbie&reg; increased by 1%, including a 4 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Domestic gross sales of Barbie&reg; decreased by 15%, primarily driven by sales declines in Barbie&reg; Fantasy and My Scene&reg; products, partially offset by sales increases in Barbie&reg; Collector products. International gross sales of Barbie&reg; increased by 12%, including an 8 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily due to higher sales of Barbie&reg; Reality and Barbie&reg; Collector products. Softness in Barbie&reg; Fantasy products worldwide was driven by the underperformance of toys associated with the 2007 Barbie&reg; entertainment properties, Barbie&reg; Magic of the Rainbow and Barbie as the Island Princess as compared to the 2006 entertainment properties, Barbie&reg; in Fairytopia II: Mermaidia&reg; and Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses&reg;. Worldwide gross sales of Other Girls Brands increased 2% from 2006, including a 5 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by strong sales of Little Mommy&reg; and High School Musical, partially offset by sales declines of Winx Club and Pixel Chix&reg; worldwide, and Polly Pocket&reg; in the US. Worldwide gross sales of Wheels products increased 14% as compared to 2006, including a 4 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in Hot Wheels&reg; and Matchbox&reg; products. Worldwide gross sales of Entertainment products, which includes games and puzzles and Radica&reg;, increased by 16% as compared to 2006, including a 5 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by continued strong worldwide sales in CARS products and inclusion of Radica&reg; sales, partially offset by sales declines in Superman products. Worldwide gross sales of Fisher Price Brands increased 8% to $2.44 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Worldwide gross sales of Core Fisher Price&reg; increased 19% as compared to 2006, including a 3 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily driven by the continued strength of infant, preschool, learning, and BabyGear sales. Worldwide gross sales of Fisher Price&reg; Friends decreased 15% as compared to 2006, including a 2 percentage point benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, primarily due to some properties declining from strong 2006 levels, partially offset by higher Sesame Street&reg; sales during 2007. Gross sales of American Girl Brands decreased 2% to $431.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily driven by the continued softness in the direct channel and lower sales of established historical characters, partially offset by strong sales of the Girl of the Year&reg;, Nicki, the launch of the newest historical character, Julie, and sales from the American Girl Boutique and Bistro retail stores, which opened in Atlanta, Georgia in August 2007 and Dallas, Texas in November 2007. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased by $154.4 million, or 5%, from $3.04 billion in 2006 to $3.19 billion in 2007, as compared to a 6% increase in net sales. On an overall basis, cost of sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased cost of sales by approximately $22 million. Within cost of sales, product costs increased by $150.6 million, or 6%, from $2.42 billion in 2006 to 31 $2.57 billion in 2007, primarily driven by increased sales volume, higher external cost pressures, and the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, partially offset by cost savings realized from supply chain efficiency initiatives. Royalty expense decreased by $17.9 million, or 7%, from $261.2 million in 2006 to $243.3 million in 2007, and is reflective of lower sales of licensed products in 2007. Freight and logistics expenses increased by $21.7 million, or 6%, from $357.3 million in 2006 to $379.0 million in 2007, primarily driven by increased sales volume. Gross Profit Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 46.5% in 2007, as compared to 46.2% in 2006. The improvement in gross profit was primarily driven by the alignment of prices with increased input costs and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by external cost pressures and an 80 basis point negative impact from the 2007 Product Recalls. Advertising and Promotion Expenses Advertising and promotion expenses increased to 11.9% of net sales in 2007, from 11.5% in 2006 due primarily to additional media and promotion to drive consumer demand at retail. Also, the 2007 Product Recalls increased advertising and promotion expenses by approximately $5 million. Other Selling and Administrative Expenses Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.34 billion in 2007, or 22.4% of net sales, as compared to $1.23 billion in 2006, or 21.8% of net sales. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses in 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the 2007 Product Recalls, which increased other selling and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million. Higher investments in the business, including design and development costs and expansion in international markets, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increases in employee related costs, and the inclusion of Radica costs also contributed to the increase. The higher costs were partially offset by lower 2007 incentive and equity compensation expenses. Other selling and administrative expenses in 2006 included $19.3 million for prior period unintentional stock option accounting errors. Non Operating Items Interest expense was $71.0 million in 2007 as compared to $79.9 million in 2006 due to lower average borrowings. Interest income increased from $30.5 million in 2006 to $33.3 million in 2007 due to higher average invested cash balances and higher interest rates. Other non operating income, net increased from $4.3 million in 2006 to $11.0 million in 2007, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains. Provision for Income Taxes Net income in 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits related to prior years of $42.0 million as a result of reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes. Net income in 2006 was positively impacted by the Tax Act passed in May 2006, and tax benefits of $63.0 million related to settlements and refunds of ongoing audits with foreign and state tax authorities.
