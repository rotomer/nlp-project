Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Mattels objective is to continue to create long term shareholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established three overarching goals. The first goal is to enhance innovation in order to reinvigorate the Barbie&reg; brand, while maintaining growth in other core brands by continuing to develop popular toys. Additionally, Mattel plans to pursue additional licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to extend its portfolio of brands into areas outside of traditional toys. The second goal is to improve execution in areas including manufacturing, distribution, and selling. Mattel continues to focus on improving the efficiency of its supply chain using Lean supply chain initiatives. The objective of the Lean program is to improve the flow of processes, do more with less, and focus on the value chain from beginning to end. The third goal is to further capitalize on Mattels scale advantage. For example, as the worlds largest toy company, Mattel believes it can realize cost savings when making purchasing decisions based on a One Mattel philosophy. 2008 Overview The toy industry was not immune to the downturn in the global economy. Consumer confidence reached an all time low in December of 2008, driving retail sales weakness in the fourth quarter as consumers, fearful of the economys direction, cut back their discretionary spending. Toy retailers and manufacturers were impacted by the economic downturn, with estimates of more than one thousand Chinese toy manufacturers closing their operations and significant toy sellers in the US, UK, Mexico, and other major markets closing their operations or entering bankruptcy. Against the backdrop of the broader economic and industry trends, Mattel underperformed for the quarter, and ultimately the year, due to a combination of lackluster sales, lower gross margins, and higher expenses: Mattels net sales declined 1 percent for the year, driven by an 11 percent decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of 2008. Mattel experienced sales shortfalls across most of its brands and throughout many of the countries in which it operates, with sales declines in the International segment for the first time since the year 2000. The decrease in sales was primarily attributable to the macro economic trends discussed above. Mattels gross margin rate declined in 2008 primarily because price increases implemented in June 2008 did not anticipate the record high product input costs Mattel experienced during its peak production period last summer. Other selling and administrative expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to incremental legal costs, settlements, and severance charges. Mattel did make progress in 2008 in a number of important areas. During 2008, American Girl&reg; achieved record revenues despite the difficult economic environment; in Mattels litigation with MGA Entertainment, Inc., a unanimous jury verdict was rendered against MGA and its Chief Executive Officer; and Mattel was awarded new toy licenses for the WWE&reg; Wrestling, Disney/Pixars Toy Story, and HIT Entertainments Thomas and Friends, which will help Mattel grow in 2010 and beyond. 26 Table of Contents 2009 and Beyond Management expects the unfavorable economic conditions experienced in 2008 to continue into 2009. Management also expects Mattels revenues to be under pressure in 2009 as a result of retail softness driven by a continued pull back in consumers willingness to spend and retailers desire to reduce inventories, weakening foreign exchange in international markets, and fewer entertainment related products in 2009. As a result, Mattel is managing its business based on realistic revenue assumptions and taking actions intended to improve profitability and strengthen its balance sheet: A modest price increase for Mattels spring 2009 product line was initiated in 2008; Mattel continues to renegotiate product costs with vendors; Mattel is evaluating reductions to the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) it offers; Mattel is reassessing its advertising spending and strategy with the expectation that 2009 advertising expense will be at the low end of its historical range of 11 to 13 percent; and Mattel initiated its Global Cost Leadership Program in 2008, which includes a global reduction in its professional workforce of approximately 1,000 people implemented in November 2008, a coordinated efficiency strategic plan that includes structural changes designed to lower costs and improve efficiencies, and additional procurement initiatives designed to fully leverage Mattels global scale. This program is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $100 million of net cost savings in 2009, and approximately $180 million to $200 million of cumulative net cost savings by the end of 2010. Management expects to focus on profitability and margins and conserve cash in 2009. As a result, Mattel is planning to tightly manage its capital expenditures in 2009 to a level that is more consistent with its levels of capital expenditures in 2003 through 2007. In addition, given the current volatile global economic environment, Mattel is prioritizing protecting Mattels dividend to shareholders and minimizing strategic acquisitions and share repurchases in 2009. Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2008 were $5.92 billion, a 1% decrease as compared to $5.97 billion in 2007, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Net income for 2008 was $379.6 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $600.0 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, for 2007. Net income for 2007 was positively impacted by net tax benefits of $42.0 million as a result of reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, including settlements, partially offset by enacted tax law changes. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 45.4% in 2008 from 46.5% in 2007. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to higher product costs driven by higher commodities, labor, and product testing costs, along with appreciating Asian currencies (collectively, input costs), higher costs of distribution, and mix, partially offset by the benefit of price increases, favorable changes in currency exchange rates, and lower product recall costs as compared to 2007. Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales declined to 8.2% in 2008 from 11.8% in 2007. Contributing to this decline were lower gross margins, higher advertising and promotion expenses, and higher other selling and administrative expenses, which were all impacted by lower sales. The increase in other selling and administrative expense in 2008 was primarily due to incremental legal and settlement related costs of approximately $52 million, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher bad debt expense. Additionally, interest expense increased in 2008 due to higher average borrowings, partially offset by lower average interest rates and interest income decreased in 2008 due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances. 27 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of Mattels consolidated results for 2008 and 2007 (in millions, except percentage and basis point information): For the Year Year/Year Change 2008 2007 Amount % of NetSales Amount % of NetSales % Basis Pointsof Net Sales Net sales $ 5,918.0 100.0 % $ 5,970.1 100.0 % 1 % Gross profit $ 2,684.4 45.4 % $ 2,777.3 46.5 % 3 % (110 ) Advertising and promotion expenses 719.2 12.2 708.8 11.9 1 % 30 Other selling and administrative expenses 1,423.4 24.1 1,338.4 22.4 6 % 170 Operating income 541.8 9.2 730.1 12.2 26 % (300 ) Interest expense 81.9 1.4 71.0 1.2 15 % 20 Interest (income) (25.0 ) 0.4 (33.3 ) 0.6 25 % 20 Other non operating (income), net (3.1 ) (11.0 ) Income before income taxes $ 488.0 8.2 % $ 703.4 11.8 % 31 % (360 ) Sales Net sales for 2008 were $5.92 billion, a 1% decrease as compared to $5.97 billion in 2007, with no impact from changes in currency exchange rates.
