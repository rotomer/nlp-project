Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Mattels objective is to continue to create long term stockholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established three overarching goals. The first goal is to grow core brands by continuing to develop popular toys that are innovative and responsive to current play patterns and other trends. Additionally, Mattel plans to pursue additional licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to extend its portfolio of brands into areas outside of traditional toys. The second goal is to improve execution in areas including manufacturing, distribution, and selling. Mattel continues to focus on improving the efficiency of its supply chain using Lean supply chain initiatives. The objective of the Lean program is to improve the flow of processes, do more with less, and focus on the value chain from beginning to end. The third goal is to further capitalize on Mattels scale advantage. For example, as the worlds largest toy company, Mattel believes it can realize cost savings when making purchasing decisions based on a One Mattel philosophy. 2009 Overview During 2009, Mattel improved execution across its supply chain and throughout the company by realigning its infrastructure, controlling costs and expenses, tightly managing working capital, especially inventories, and reducing capital spending by doing only business critical projects. This resulted in improved profitability, a stronger balance sheet, and improved cash flow, which Mattel used to lower debt, increase cash balances, and continue to reward stockholders through its strong annual dividend. More specifically: Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.4% in 2008 to 50.0% in 2009, primarily due to price increases and net cost savings related to Mattels Global Cost Leadership program, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income increased from $541.8 million in 2008 to $731.2 million in 2009, primarily due to higher gross profit, lower advertising and promotion expenses, and lower other selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower sales. The Global Cost Leadership program generated gross costs savings before severance charges of approximately $164 million during 2009 (or approximately $132 million net of 2009 severance charges of approximately $32 million). Cash flows from operations increased from $436.3 million in 2008 to $945.0 million in 2009. Capital expenditures decreased from $198.8 million in 2008 to $120.5 million in 2009. 2010 and Beyond Mattels focus for 2010 is to build on its progress towards its long term profitability goals, in light of what it expects to be a challenging cost environment and a continuation of a difficult economic environment. Over the long term, Mattels goals are to achieve gross margin of approximately 50%, advertising expense of approximately 11% to 13%, and other selling and administrative expenses of approximately 20%, which should result in operating margins of approximately 15% to 20%. Mattel will continue to manage its business based on 26 Table of Contents realistic revenue assumptions, but is more optimistic about its revenue in 2010 based on the momentum of its core brands from 2009, strong partnerships for licensed brands in 2010, including WWE&reg; Wrestling, Disney/Pixars Toy Story&reg;, and HIT Entertainments Thomas and Friends&reg;, and its evergreen licensed properties. In addition to its revenue generating activities, Mattel will also continue to take actions intended to improve profitability, including: Continuing to execute its Global Cost Leadership program; Continuing its other cost and manufacturing efficiency programs; and Pricing products consistent with its long term operating margin goals given likely cost pressures, such as commodities and labor rates in China. Results of Operations 2009 Compared to 2008 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2009 were $5.43 billion, an 8% decrease as compared to $5.92 billion in 2008, including unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates of 2 percentage points. Net income for 2009 was $528.7 million, or $1.45 per diluted share as compared to net income of $379.6 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for 2008. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by net tax benefits of $28.8 million related to reassessments of prior years tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 50.0% in 2009 from 45.4% in 2008. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to price increases and net cost savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.2% in 2009 from 8.2% in 2008. Contributing to this increase were higher gross profit and lower advertising and promotion expenses, partially offset by higher other selling and administrative expenses.

The dollar decrease in other selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to incremental year over year savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program (approximately $88 million in gross savings along with approximately $3 million of lower severance in 2009), the impact of foreign currency exchange benefits, and lower litigation and legal settlement related costs of approximately $27 million, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense of approximately $81 million and higher equity compensation expense of approximately $14 million.

Other non operating expense was $7.4 million in 2009 as compared to other non operating income of $3.1 million in 2008.
