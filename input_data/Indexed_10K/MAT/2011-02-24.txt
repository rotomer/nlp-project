Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Mattels objective is to continue to create long term stockholder value by generating strong cash flow and deploying it in a disciplined and opportunistic manner as outlined in Mattels capital and investment framework. To achieve this objective, management has established three overarching strategies. The first strategy is to deliver consistent growth by continuing the momentum in its core brands, optimizing entertainment partnerships, building new franchises, and working to expand and leverage its international footprint. The second strategy is to build on the progress it has made on improving operating margins through at least sustaining the gross margins and delivering another round of cost savings. The third strategy is to generate significant cash flow and continue its disciplined, opportunistic, and value enhancing deployment. 2010 Overview Mattels focus for 2010 was to build on its progress towards its long term profitability goals, in light of what it expected to be a challenging cost environment and a continuation of a difficult economic environment. The three main objectives in achieving these goals included capitalizing on opportunities to increase revenues by continuing core brand performance, while maximizing the opportunities surrounding its new Entertainment properties, maintaining cost and expense controls, and delivering another strong year of profits and cash flow. In 2010, Mattel delivered strong financial results with solid revenue growth across its portfolio of brands and markets. Mattel sustained gross margin at its long term target of approximately 50%. Mattel also successfully completed its Global Cost Leadership program, all of which resulted in an operating margin of 15.4%, which, for the first time in several years, is within its long term goal range of 15% to 20%. In addition, Mattel generated significant cash flow, which it deployed to create value for its stockholders. More specifically: Net sales increased 8%, from $5.43 billion in 2009 to $5.86 billion in 2010. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 50.0% in 2009 to 50.5% in 2010, primarily due to effective pricing and net cost savings related to Mattels Global Cost Leadership program, partially offset by higher royalty expense as a result of increased sales of products tied to licensed properties. Mattels Global Cost Leadership program generated year over year incremental gross costs savings before severance charges of approximately $61 million during 2010 (or approximately $48 million net of 2010 severance charges of approximately $13 million), for cumulative gross cost savings before severance charges of approximately $225 million. Operating income increased from $731.2 million in 2009 to $901.9 million in 2010, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher gross profit, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expenses and higher other selling and administrative expenses. Mattel increased its annual dividend to $0.83 per share, an increase of 11% from the prior year, and repurchased 18.6 million shares of its common stock. 25 Table of Contents 2011 and Beyond Mattels global strategic priorities for 2011 and beyond are to deliver consistent growth by continuing the momentum in its core brands, optimizing its entertainment partnerships, building new franchises, and working to expand and leverage its international footprint. Mattel aims to build on the progress it has made on improving operating margins through sustaining gross margins of at least 50% and delivering another round of cost savings, which includes targeting an additional cumulative cost savings of approximately $150 million to be achieved by the end of 2012. The additional cost savings are expected to include approximately $75 million in legal costs, which will reduce other selling and administrative expenses, and approximately $75 million of cost savings, which will be reflected in gross profit, advertising and promotion expenses, and other selling and administrative expenses, from the launch of the next phase of the Global Cost Leadership program. Mattel also expects to generate significant cash flow and continue its disciplined, opportunistic, and value enhancing deployment of its cash. Results of Operations 2010 Compared to 2009 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2010 were $5.86 billion, an 8% increase, as compared to $5.43 billion in 2009, including unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates of 2 percentage points. Net income for 2010 was $684.9 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $528.7 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in 2009. As compared to 2009, net income for 2010 was positively impacted by higher net sales, higher gross profit, and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expenses, higher other selling and administrative expenses, and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 50.5% in 2010 from 50.0% in 2009. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to effective pricing and net cost savings related to the Global Cost Leadership program, partially offset by higher royalty expense as a result of increased sales of products tied to licensed properties.
