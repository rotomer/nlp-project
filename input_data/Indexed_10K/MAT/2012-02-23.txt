Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Mattels vision is creating the future of play. Mattels objectives are to grow its share in the marketplace, sustain gross margins of about 50%, leverage its scale to deliver cost savings and lower its selling and administrative costs, and create long term stockholder value. To achieve these objectives, management has established the following strategies: The first strategy is to deliver consistent growth by continuing the momentum in its core brands, optimizing entertainment partnerships, building new franchises, and working to expand and leverage its international footprint. The second strategy is to optimize operating margins through sustaining gross margins of about 50% and delivering on cost savings initiatives. The third strategy is to generate significant cash flow and continue its disciplined, opportunistic, and value enhancing deployment. 2011 Overview During 2011, Mattel delivered strong financial results with solid revenue growth across its portfolio of brands and markets, despite the soft global economic backdrop and the highly promotional environment. Mattel maintained momentum in its core brands such as Barbie&reg;, Hot Wheels&reg;, American Girl&reg;, and its new franchise, Monster High&reg;, as well as maximized key entertainment properties such as Disney Princess&reg; and CARS 2&reg;. Mattel sustained gross margins at its long term target of approximately 50% and generated $1.04 billion of operating income, or 16.6% of net sales, which is within its long term goal range of operating margins of 15% to 20%. Mattel also generated significant cash flow, which it deployed to create value for its stockholders. More specifically: Net sales increased to $6.27 billion in 2011, up 7% from $5.86 billion in 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 50.2% in 2011 from 50.5% in 2010. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher product costs, higher royalty expenses as a result of increased sales of products tied to licensed properties, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by price increases and net cost savings from Mattels Operational Excellence 2.0 initiatives. Operating income increased from $901.9 million in 2010 to $1.04 billion in 2011, primarily due to higher net sales, lower incentive and share based compensation expense, net cost savings from Mattels Operational Excellence 2.0 program, and lower legal expenses, partially offset by higher employee related costs. Mattels Operational Excellence 2.0 program resulted in cost savings before severance charges and investments of approximately $94 million (or approximately $71 million in net cost savings). The gross cost savings included approximately $53 million of structural cost savings generated by the program and approximately $41 million of legal cost savings. Mattel paid total annual dividends of $0.92 per share, an increase of 11% from the prior year, and repurchased 20.4 million shares of its common stock. 26 Table of Contents 2012 and Beyond In 2012, Mattel will continue to work to deliver consistent growth and financial performance by executing against its existing strategies through: (i) capitalizing on Fisher Prices global opportunity, (ii) integrating HIT Entertainment, which was acquired in February 2012, into Mattel (iii) optimizing its entertainment partnerships (which for 2012 include Brave and Batman&reg;), (iv) continuing to accelerate growth in Monster High&reg;, (v) creating new franchises, (vi) expanding into new toy categories, and (vii) continuing to expand its international footprint. In 2012, Mattel is implementing a change to its organizational structure to include a North America division and global brand teams. This new structure recognizes the opportunity to move decision making for the US business closer to its retail customers and its toy consumers. Additionally, it gives Mattels brand teams the ability to approach the business and creative process more globally, recognizing the growth outside the US. In addition, Mattel plans to deliver another year of cost savings through its Operational Excellence 2.0 initiatives. Results of Operations 2011 Compared to 2010 Consolidated Results Net sales for 2011 were $6.27 billion, a 7% increase, as compared to $5.86 billion in 2010, with favorable changes in currency exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Net income for 2011 was $768.5 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $684.9 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, in 2010. As compared to 2010, net income for 2011 was positively impacted by higher net sales and higher operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate, higher interest expense, and higher other non operating expense. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 50.2% in 2011 from 50.5% in 2010. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher product costs, higher royalty expenses as a result of increased sales of products tied to licensed properties, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by price increases and net cost savings from Mattels Operational Excellence 2.0 initiatives.

Non Operating Items Interest expense was $75.3 million in 2011, as compared to $64.8 million in 2010, driven primarily by higher average borrowings resulting from the $500.0 million of senior notes issued in September 2010 and the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in November of 2011, partially offset by the repayment of $250.0 million of maturing debt in 2011 and lower average interest rates.
