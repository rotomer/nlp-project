Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Nature of business The Company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates quick service restaurant businesses under the McDonalds brand. Approximately 80% of McDonalds restaurants and more than 80% of the Systemwide sales of McDonalds restaurants are in eight markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Throughout this discussion, McDonalds restaurant businesses in these eight markets collectively are referred to as "major markets." To capture additional meal occasions, the Company also operates other restaurant concepts under its Partner Brands: Aroma Cafe, Boston Market, Chipotle and Donatos Pizzeria. In addition, the Company has a minority ownership in Pret A Manger. In fourth quarter of 2001, the Company approved a plan to dispose of its Aroma Cafe business in the U.K., and expects to complete the sale in the first half of 2002. The segments presented in all tables and related discussion reflect the Companys current management structure. Previously, McDonalds restaurant operations in Canada, the Middle East and Africa, as well as the Partner Brands were included in the Other segment. The new APMEA segment includes results for McDonalds restaurant operations in Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, while Canada and the Partner Brands are now presented as individual operating segments. In addition, U.S. and Corporate selling, general & administrative expenses reflect a realignment of certain home office departments responsibilities, for all years presented.

McDonalds Corporation 9 The following table presents the 2001 growth rates for reported results, results adjusted for the special items noted below, and the adjusted results on a constant currency basis. In addition, the table includes the 2000 growth rates for reported and constant currency results. All information in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results, except for hyperinflationary economies, such as Russia, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year monthly average exchange rates.

Nonoperating income: * $137 million gain (pre and after tax) on the initial public offering of McDonalds Japan. * $12 million of charges ($8 million after tax) primarily related to the write off of a corporate investment. (3) Excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results. The primary currencies negatively affecting reported results in 2001 and 2000 were the Euro, which is the currency in 12 of our European markets including France and Germany, the British Pound and the Australian Dollar. In addition, the Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar negatively impacted reported results in 2001, while the Japanese Yen positively impacted reported results in 2000. SYSTEMWIDE SALES Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint venture agreements. We continue to focus on growing market share by increasing comparable sales with an emphasis on improving customer satisfaction through Quality, Service, Cleanliness and Value as well as strategic restaurant development. Restaurant expansion, partly offset by negative comparable sales, drove the constant currency sales increase in 2001, while restaurant expansion along with positive comparable sales drove the increase in 2000.

In all segments, the constant currency sales increases in 2001 and 2000 were primarily driven by expansion. In the U.S., comparable sales were slightly positive in 2001 and positive in 2000. The introduction of the New Tastes Menu in early 2001 and successful promotions and new product introductions in 2000, combined with local market initiatives in both years, contributed to the increases. In Europe, comparable sales were negative in 2001 and positive in 2000. The primary contributors to Europes constant currency sales growth in both years were France and the U.K. In addition, the Netherlands and Russia delivered strong performances in 2001, while results in 2000 also benefited from increases in Germany, Italy and Spain. Despite the Companys outstanding quality and safety record, Europes results in both years were negatively impacted by consumer confidence issues regarding the European beef supply. However, the impact lessened as we progressed through 2001, and we do not expect the negative impact from these issues to be significant going forward. In APMEA, comparable sales were negative in 2001 and slightly negative in 2000. Sales in 2001 were impacted by weak economic conditions in Japan, Taiwan and Turkey and weak consumer spending in Australia, which also impacted the second half of 2000. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001, sales were also dampened by consumer confidence issues regarding the Japanese beef supply, 10 McDonalds Corporation despite the fact that McDonalds Japan does not use Japanese beef. Although we are proactively communicating our strong beef safety and quality messages, we expect Japans results in the near term to continue to be negatively affected by these consumer concerns. Positive comparable sales in China contributed to this segments total constant currency sales increases in both years. In Latin America, comparable sales were negative in 2001 and 2000 as weak economic conditions affected most markets in this segment. Positive comparable sales in Mexico and Venezuela helped drive this segments total constant currency sales increases in both years. We expect the weak economic conditions in many Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets to continue in the near term. In Canada, comparable sales were positive in 2001 and 2000. Canadas value program combined with drive thru initiatives, extended hours and new product introductions drove the increases in both years. The sales increases in the Partner Brands in 2001 and 2000 were primarily due to the acquisition of Boston Market in second quarter 2000. Expansion of Chipotle along with strong comparable sales at Chipotle and Boston Market also helped drive the increases in both years.

(5) Excludes U.S. because the Company did not open a significant number of satellite restaurants in the U.S. Average sales per restaurant in constant currencies are affected by comparable sales as well as the size, location and number of new restaurants. The number of new restaurants affects average sales because new restaurants typically take a few years to reach long term sales volumes. In addition, over the last several years more restaurants outside the U.S. have opened in lower density areas and in countries with lower average sales volumes and correspondingly lower average development costs. In 2001, average annual sales per traditional restaurant were relatively flat for the U.S. and Canada in constant currencies. In the other segments, average annual sales per traditional restaurant declined in constant currencies due to negative comparable sales and the significant number of new restaurants added, partly offset by the benefit of closing 163 underperforming restaurants. In 2000, positive comparable sales in the U.S. and Canada drove their increases in average annual sales per traditional restaurant. In the other segments, the declines were mainly due to new restaurant development. Satellite restaurants generally have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes than traditional restaurants. The use of these small, limited menu restaurants has allowed profitable expansion into areas that otherwise would not have been feasible. In 2001 and 2000, average annual sales for satellite restaurants increased in the U.S. partly due to the closing of certain low volume satellites. Outside the U.S., average annual sales for satellite restaurants declined slightly in constant currencies in 2001 primarily due to negative comparable sales in Japan, after increasing in 2000 primarily due to higher sales volumes for openings in Japan. In 2001, average sales for new traditional restaurants in the U.S. remained at about $1.6 million as we continued our selective expansion in higher volume locations with the development of larger facilities that support higher average sales. In segments outside the U.S., average sales for new traditional restaurants in constant currencies declined due to a higher proportion of openings in lower volume markets such as South Korea and Mexico and lower sales volumes for new traditional restaurants opened in Germany, Italy, the U.K., Japan, Argentina and Canada. The lower volumes in Germany, Italy and Japan were partly due to the consumer confidence issues regarding the beef supply. In 2000, average sales for new traditional restaurants in the U.S. increased due to selective expansion and the development of larger facilities. In Europe and Latin America, average sales for new traditional restaurants in constant currencies decreased due to a higher proportion of openings in lower volume markets. In APMEA, average sales for new traditional restaurants increased due to higher sales volumes in China and a higher proportion of openings in higher volume markets such as Japan. McDonalds Corporation 11 TOTAL REVENUES Total revenues include sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees include rent, service fees and royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees. Fees vary by type of site and investment by the Company and also according to local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have 20 year terms. Revenues grow as new restaurants are added and as sales build in existing restaurants. Menu price changes also affect revenues and sales, but it is impractical to quantify their impact because of different pricing structures, new products, promotions and product mix variations among restaurants and markets.

On a constant currency basis, total revenues increased at a higher rate than sales in 2001 primarily due to the second quarter 2000 acquisition of Boston Market restaurants, which are all Company operated, and the restructuring of our ownership in the Philippines, effective July 1, 2001. As a result of the restructuring, most of our restaurants in the Philippines are now Company operated rather than franchised. In addition, revenues benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received from our Japanese affiliate, effective January 1, 2001. In 2000, total revenues increased at a higher rate than sales due the acquisition of Boston Market and the acquisition of Donatos in third quarter 1999 as well as the consolidation of Argentina and Indonesia for financial reporting purposes in 2000. OPERATING INCOME Consolidated operating income decreased 19% in 2001 and was relatively flat in 2000 compared with 1999. Excluding the special items noted in the footnote to the table on page 9, adjusted operating income decreased 5% in constant currencies in 2001. Adjusted operating income decreased in 2001 primarily due to lower combined operating margin dollars and lower other operating income along with higher selling, general & administrative expenses. In constant currencies, operating income increased 5% in 2000, primarily due to higher combined operating margin dollars and higher other operating income, partly offset by higher selling, general & administrative expenses.

U.S. operating income for 2001 included $181 million of special charges, primarily related to the U.S. business reorganization and costs incurred in connection with the theft of promotional game pieces and related termination of a supplier discussed on page 14. U.S. operating income accounted for over 50% of consolidated operating income in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Excluding the special charges, U.S. adjusted operating income was relatively flat in 2001 compared with an increase of $116 million or 7% in 2000. The increase in 2000 was due to higher combined operating margin dollars and higher other operating income. Europes operating income for 2001 included $46 million of special charges related to the closing of 50 underperforming restaurants across Europe and global change initiatives. Europes operating income accounted for more than 35% of consolidated operating income in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Excluding the special charges, Europes adjusted operating income decreased 3% in 2001 and increased 6% in 2000 in constant currencies. In both years, consumer confidence issues regarding the European beef supply negatively impacted results. This segments results in 2001 benefited from strong performances in France and Russia. The increase in 2000 was primarily driven by strong operating results in France, Italy and Spain. France, Germany and the U.K. accounted for about 75% of Europes operating income in 2001, 2000 and 1999. APMEAs operating income for 2001 included $42 million of special charges, primarily related to the closing of 50 underperforming restaurants, mainly in Malaysia and the Philippines, and the asset impairment charge in 12 McDonalds Corporation Turkey. Excluding the special charges, APMEAs adjusted operating income decreased 10% in 2001 and increased 5% in 2000 in constant currencies. In 2001, strong results in China, the increase in the royalty percent received from our affiliate in Japan and a gain on the sale of real estate in Singapore were more than offset by weak operating results in Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Turkey. The increase in 2000 was driven primarily by Japan, which benefited from the partial sale of its ownership in Toys `R Us Japan, as well as strong results in China and South Korea. Results in both years were negatively affected by the introduction of the goods and services tax in Australia in July 2000. Australia and Japan accounted for more than 60% of APMEAs operating income in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Latin Americas operating income for 2001 included $40 million of special charges related to the closing of 58 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Brazil and Puerto Rico, and global change initiatives. Excluding the special charges, Latin Americas adjusted operating income decreased 46% in 2001 and 23% in 2000 in constant currencies. Results in both years were negatively impacted by the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by most markets in the segment. Brazil accounted for more than 55% of Latin Americas operating income in each of the past three years. Canadas operating income for 2001 included $10 million of special charges related to the closing of five underperforming restaurants and to global change initiatives. Operating income for the Partner Brands in 2001 included special charges of $20 million related to the anticipated disposal of Aroma Cafe and $5 million related to global change initiatives. Results in the Corporate segment included $34 million of special charges related to global change initiatives and the write off of certain technology costs. Excluding the special charges, the adjusted decrease in the Corporate segment of 22% in 2001 was primarily due to increased spending on future restaurant related technology improvements. As a result of continuing economic weakness in Latin America and Turkey, the Company expects to record a non cash charge of approximately $45 million (pre and after tax) related to the impairment of assets in Latin America and closing of underperforming restaurants in Turkey in first quarter 2002. OPERATING MARGINS Operating margin information and discussions relate to McDonalds restaurants only and exclude Partner Brands. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars are equal to sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars declined $145 million in 2001 and $4 million in 2000. In constant currencies, Company operated margin dollars declined $96 million or 6% in 2001, compared with an increase of $73 million or 4% in 2000. The 2001 constant currency decrease was primarily due to negative comparable sales, partly offset by expansion, while the 2000 constant currency increase was due to expansion and positive comparable sales. Company operated margins were 15.1% of sales in 2001, 16.9% in 2000 and 17.7% in 1999. Operating cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows: food & paper costs as well as occupancy & other operating expenses increased in 2001 and 2000; payroll costs increased in 2001 and were flat in 2000.

Europes Company operated margins as a percent of sales declined in 2001, primarily due to higher payroll costs and negative comparable sales. In 2000, Europes Company operated margin percent declined as all costs increased as a percent of sales. In APMEA, negative comparable sales in 2001 and slightly negative comparable sales in 2000 affected Company operated margins as a percent of sales. In 2001, the change in restaurant classification in the Philippines also contributed to APMEAs margin decline because its Company operated margins were lower than the average for the segment. In Latin America, the margin declines were due to difficult economic conditions in most markets and negative comparable sales in both years. Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars are equal to revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented more than 60% of the combined operating margins in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Franchised margin dollars increased $26 million in 2001, compared with a $6 million decline in 2000. In constant currencies, the franchised margin dollars increased $91 million or 3% in 2001 and $119 million or 4% in 2000, primarily driven by the increase in the Japan royalty percent effective January 1, 2001, as well as expansion in both years and positive comparable sales in 2000. McDonalds Corporation 13 Franchised margins McDonalds restaurants IN MILLIONS 2001 2000 1999 U.S. $ 1,799 $ 1,765 $ 1,730 Europe 792 802 828 APMEA 229 199 211 Latin America 103 135 144 Canada 105 101 95 Total $ 3,028 $ 3,002 $ 3,008 PERCENT OF REVENUES U.S. 79.7% 80.4% 81.0% Europe 77.2 78.3 79.0 APMEA 86.2 81.5 82.3 Latin America 68.4 73.0 77.5 Canada 80.4 80.2 79.9 Total 79.1% 79.5% 80.3% The declines in the consolidated franchised margin percent in 2001 and 2000 reflected higher occupancy costs due to an increased number of leased sites in all geographic segments. Our strategy of leasing a higher proportion of new sites over the past few years has reduced initial capital requirements and related interest expense. However, as anticipated, franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues have been negatively impacted because financing costs implicit in the lease are included in rent expense, which affects these margins. For owned sites, financing costs are reflected in interest expense, which does not affect these margins. In 2001, franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues decreased in Europe and Latin America partly due to rent assistance provided to franchisees in certain markets and negative comparable sales. We expect to continue providing rent assistance in certain Latin American markets in 2002. The franchised margin percent in APMEA increased for 2001 and decreased in 2000. The 2001 increase was primarily due to an increase in the royalty percent received from our Japanese affiliate and the restructuring of the Philippines operations that resulted in the reclassification of franchised margins that were lower than the average for the segment. In 2000, our purchase of a majority interest in certain affiliate markets in both APMEA and Latin America shifted revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants to Company operated restaurants, which contributed to the reduction in the franchised restaurant margin percents. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 5% in 2001 and 7% in 2000 (7% and 11% in constant currencies). Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 4.1% in 2001, 4.0% in 2000 and 3.8% in 1999. The increase in 2001 was partly due to increased spending on future restaurant related technology improvements in the Corporate segment and higher selling, general & administrative expenses for the Partner Brands. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to spending to support the development of Partner Brands and the consolidation of Argentina and Indonesia for financial reporting purposes. Selling, general & administrative expenses in both years benefited from weaker foreign currencies and lower expense for performance based incentive compensation. As a result of the global change initiatives described below, the Company expects ongoing annual selling, general & administrative savings of about $100 million in 2002, compared with what otherwise would have been spent.

Corporate expenses consist of home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, supply chain management and training. SPECIAL CHARGE GLOBAL CHANGE INITIATIVES In fourth quarter 2001, the Company recorded a $200 million pretax special charge ($136 million after tax) related to strategic changes and ongoing restaurant initiatives in the U.S. and certain international markets. The changes and initiatives are designed to improve the customer experience and grow McDonalds global business. The changes in the U.S. included streamlining operations by reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the Company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. In addition, the U.S. business introduced a variety of initiatives designed to improve the restaurant experience including accelerated operations training, restaurant simplification, incentives for outstanding restaurant operations and an enhanced national restaurant evaluation system. In connection with these initiatives, the Company eliminated approximately 850 positions, consisting of 700 positions in the U.S., primarily in the divisions and regions, and 150 positions in international markets. The special charge consisted of $114 million of severance and other employee related costs; $69 million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of region and division facilities; and $17 million of other cash costs, primarily consisting of payments made to facilitate a timely and smooth change of ownership from franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future. 14 McDonalds Corporation Of the original $200 million pretax special charge, the remaining accrual of approximately $126 million at year end 2001 primarily related to employee severance and lease payments for facilities that have been closed and was included in other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. Employee severance is paid in installments over a period of up to one year after termination, and the remaining lease payments for facilities that have been closed will be paid through 2010. No significant adjustments have been made to the original plan approved by management. The Company expects to use cash provided by operations to fund the remaining employee severance and lease obligations. OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense includes gains on sales of restaurant businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, restaurant closing and asset impairment charges, and other transactions related to franchising and the food service business. Other operating (income) expense, net IN MILLIONS 2001 2000 1999 Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $(112) $ (87) $ (75) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (62) (121) (138) Charges for underperforming restaurant closings 91 Asset impairment charges 44 Other, net 96 12 108 Total $ 57 $(196) $(105) Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses). The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are an integral part of our business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. The decrease in 2001 was due to weaker results in Japan, the increase in Japans royalty expense and a weaker Japanese Yen. Although the increase in royalty expense reduced McDonalds equity in earnings for Japan, it was more than offset by the royalty benefit McDonalds received in franchised revenues. In 1999, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates included a $21 million gain from the sale of real estate in a U.S. partnership. The Company recorded $91 million of pretax charges ($69 million after tax) in 2001 related to the closing of 163 underperforming restaurants in international markets. The losses on these closed restaurants were recognized in the period the restaurant ceased operations, and the charges primarily consisted of asset write offs and lease termination costs. The asset impairment charges in 2001 consisted of a $24 million charge (pre and after tax) as a result of an assessment of the ongoing impact of significant currency devaluation on McDonalds cash flows in Turkey and a pretax charge of $20 million ($14 million after tax) related to the anticipated sale of Aroma which we expect to be completed in the first half of 2002. Other expense for 2001 included a pretax charge of $25 million ($17 million after tax) in the U.S., primarily related to unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the Companys Monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces. Fifty one people (none of whom were Company employees) were subsequently indicted on conspiracy and mail fraud charges. In 2001, the Company also recorded a pretax charge of $17 million ($12 million after tax), primarily related to the write off of certain technology costs in the Corporate segment. Other expense for 1999 included the write off of $24 million ($16 million after tax) of software not used in the business. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased in 2001 and 2000 due to higher average debt levels, partly offset by weaker foreign currencies in both years and lower average interest rates in 2001. Average debt levels were higher in both years because the Company used its available credit capacity to repurchase shares of its common stock. Based on current interest rates, we anticipate interest expense will decline in 2002. McDONALDS JAPAN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) GAIN In third quarter 2001, McDonalds Japan, the Companys largest market in the APMEA segment, completed an IPO of 12 million shares at an offering price of 4,300 Yen per share ($34.77 per share). The Company owns 50% of McDonalds Japan while the Companys partner Den Fujita and his family own approximately 26% and continue to be involved in the business. The Company recorded a $137 million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the IPO received by McDonalds Japan. NONOPERATING EXPENSE, NET Nonoperating expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income, minority interests, and gains and losses related to other investments, financings and translation. Results in 2001 included the write off of a corporate investment, the write off of a financing McDonalds Corporation 15 receivable from a supplier in Latin America and minority interest expense related to the sale of real estate in Singapore, partly offset by translation gains. Results in 2000 reflected lower minority interest expense and lower translation losses than 1999 and a gain related to the sale of a partial ownership interest in a majority owned international subsidiary. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate was 29.8% in 2001, 31.4% in 2000 and 32.5% in 1999. The lower effective income tax rate in 2001 was primarily due to the one time benefit of tax law changes in certain international markets. Also contributing to the decrease in the income tax rate was the Japan IPO gain, partly offset by certain restaurant closing charges and the Turkey asset impairment charge, none of which were tax affected for financial reporting purposes. The decrease in the income tax rate in 2000 was the result of a tax benefit resulting from an international transaction. The Company expects its 2002 effective income tax rate to be approximately 32.0% to 33.0%. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $720 million in 2001 and $523 million in 2000. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE In 2001, net income decreased 17%, and diluted net income per common share decreased 14%. Excluding the special items noted in the footnote to the table on page 9, net income decreased 8%, and diluted net income per common share decreased 5% in constant currencies. In 2000, net income increased 2%, and diluted net income per common share increased 5%. On a constant currency basis, these increases were 6% and 10%. The spread between the percent change in net income and diluted net income per common share for both years was due to lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased and a less dilutive effect from stock options. Cash flows The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending. Cash from operations totaled $2.7 billion in 2001 and, although slightly lower than the amount in 2000, exceeded capital expenditures for the eleventh consecutive year. In 2000, cash from operations totaled $2.8 billion. This amount was less than in 1999, primarily due to higher income tax payments in 2000 as a result of both lower tax benefits related to stock option exercises and higher gains on the termination of foreign currency exchange agreements. Cash provided by operations, along with borrowings and other sources of cash, is used for capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments. Cash provided by operations DOLLARS IN MILLIONS 2001 2000 1999 Cash provided by operations $ 2,688 $ 2,751 $ 3,009 Free cash flow/(1)/ 782 806 1,141 Cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures 141% 141% 161% Cash provided by operations as a percent of average total debt 31 35 42 (1) Cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. In addition to its free cash flow, the Company can meet short term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Accordingly, the Company strategically and purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio, which was .81 at year end 2001. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT Capital expenditures decreased $39 million or 2% in 2001 and increased $77 million or 4% in 2000. Capital expenditures for McDonalds restaurants in 2001, 2000 and 1999 reflected our strategy of leasing a higher proportion of new sites and the U.S. building program, which gives franchisees the option to own new restaurant buildings. About 80% of new and rebuilt U.S. traditional franchised and affiliated restaurant buildings in 2001 and 2000 are owned by franchisees and affiliates. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2001 was primarily due to lower spending in Europe and Latin America and weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by additional expenditures for Partner Brands and McDonalds restaurant business in the U.S. and China. Capital expenditures in 2000 increased due to higher spending for Partner Brands and the consolidation of Argentina and Indonesia, partly offset by weaker foreign currencies. Approximately 60% of capital expenditures was invested in major markets excluding Japan in 2001, 2000 and 1999 (Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly, its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts). Capital expenditures in markets outside the U.S. accounted for about 65% of total expenditures in 2001 and about 70% in 2000 and 1999. The Companys expenditures for new restaurants in the U.S. are lower than they would have been as a result of the leasing strategy and the U.S. building program. For new franchised and affiliated restaurants, which represent about 85% of U.S. restaurants, the Company generally incurs no capital expenditures. However, the Company maintains long term occupancy rights for the land and receives related rental income. While the Company no longer makes significant expenditures on new sites in the U.S., we continue to focus on the Systems average development costs (land, building and equipment) to ensure an appropriate return on investment for the System. Average development costs for new traditional restaurants in the U.S. System were $1.7 million in 2001, $1.6 million in 2000 and $1.5 million in 1999. The 16 McDonalds Corporation increases were primarily due to the construction of larger facilities designed to support higher average sales volumes. Certain of the land the Company leases in the U.S. is leased from System Capital Corporation (SCC). The Company and six other unaffiliated companies that supply the McDonalds System are equal owners of SCC. No employees of SCC are employees of the seven shareholders. The Companys investment in SCC is accounted for on the cost basis. SCCs purpose is to provide funding to McDonalds franchisees, suppliers to the McDonalds System and McDonalds Corporation and to build equity within SCC that will benefit the McDonalds System. Its function is similar to that of a cooperative. SCCs primary operating activities include (1) providing loans to qualifying U.S. franchisees to purchase existing restaurant businesses as well as finance equipment, buildings and working capital, (2) contracting for construction of restaurant buildings and selling them to U.S. franchisees, (3) purchasing accounts receivable and financing inventory and other needs of eligible suppliers and distributors, and (4) acquiring and leasing land to McDonalds Corporation for new restaurants, primarily in the U.S. The Companys commitments under these leases are included in operating lease commitments on pages 19 and 31 and total approximately $14 million annually based on current interest rates. SCC funds itself in the capital markets on an independent basis. Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch periodically review SCC, including reviews of key performance indicators and asset quality. These rating agencies currently rate SCCs funding subsidiarys commercial paper A 1, P 1 and F1; and its long term debt Aa2, AA and AA, respectively. SCC competes with other lenders who provide similar financing to franchisees and suppliers. SCC is not permitted to hold McDonalds stock, and McDonalds has no commitments or guarantees that provide for the potential issuance of its stock to SCC. SCC does not engage in speculative derivative activities, and SCC does not hedge McDonalds positions. In addition, no McDonalds employee is permitted to invest in SCC.

(2) Primarily for computer equipment and furnishings for office buildings. Average development costs outside the U.S. vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment owned by the Company, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, standardization and global sourcing. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Average development costs for new traditional restaurants in major markets outside the U.S. excluding Japan were approximately $1.5 million in 2001, $1.6 million in 2000 and $1.8 million in 1999. Average annual sales for new traditional restaurants in the same markets were about $1.4 million in 2001, $1.5 million in 2000 and $1.7 million in 1999. Average development costs for new satellite restaurants located in Canada and Japan, which comprise more than 90% of the satellites outside the U.S., were about $200,000 (excluding lease costs) in 2001, 2000 and 1999. The use of these small, limited menu restaurants, for which the land and building generally are leased, has allowed expansion into areas that otherwise would not have been feasible. The Company and its affiliates owned 38% of the land for its restaurant sites at year end 2001 and 40% at year end 2000. Capital expenditures by affiliates, which were not included in consolidated amounts, were about $181 million in 2001, $204 million in 2000 and $259 million in 1999. The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to the consolidation of Argentina in 2000.

McDonalds continues to focus on managing capital outlays effectively through selective expansion. In 2001, the Company added 1,319 McDonalds restaurants Systemwide, compared with 1,606 in 2000 and 1,598 in 1999. In addition, the Company added 67 restaurants in 2001 operated by Partner Brands, compared with 792 restaurants in 2000, 707 of which were the result of the Boston Market acquisition. In 2002, the Company expects to add 1,300 to 1,400 McDonalds restaurants and open 100 to 150 new Partner Brands restaurants. In 2001, more than 60% of McDonalds restaurant additions was in the major markets, and we anticipate a similar percent for 2002. Almost 50% of Company operated restaurants and nearly 85% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2001. Franchisees and affiliates operated 74% of McDonalds restaurants at year end 2001. Partner Brands restaurants are primarily Company operated. McDonalds Corporation 17 SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS The Company uses free cash flow and credit capacity to repurchase shares, as we believe this enhances shareholder value. During 2001, the Company purchased 36.1 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion. Cumulative share purchases over the past five years totaled $6.0 billion or 187.4 million shares. In 2002, the Company began purchasing shares under a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2001. We expect to purchase shares under this program over the next four years, depending on free cash flow. To reduce the overall cost of treasury stock purchases, the Company sells common equity put options in connection with its share repurchase program and receives premiums for these options. The Company sold 12.2 million common equity put options in 2001 and 16.8 million in 2000 and received premiums of $32 million in 2001 and $56 million in 2000. These premiums were reflected in shareholders equity as a reduction of the cost of treasury stock purchased. At December 31, 2001, 12.2 million common equity put options were outstanding, of which 3.0 million were exercised in February 2002 at a cost of $87 million. The remaining options expire at various dates through November 2002, with exercise prices between $26.37 and $30.23. During 2001, the Company also entered into equity forward contracts in connection with its share repurchase program. The equity forward contracts, totaling $151 million for 5.5 million shares, settled in March 2002 at an average price of $27.41 per share. Given the Companys returns on equity and assets, management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of earnings back into the business and use free cash flow for share repurchases. Accordingly, the common stock dividend yield is modest. However, the Company has paid dividends on common stock for 26 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing needs. Cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. As in the past, future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Financial position and capital resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets grew by $851 million or 4% in 2001 and $700 million or 3% in 2000. At year end 2001 and 2000, more than 60% of consolidated assets was located in the major markets excluding Japan. Net property and equipment rose $242 million in 2001 and represented 77% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2001/(1)/ 2000 1999 Return on average assets 14.1% 15.9% 16.6% Return on average common equity 19.1 21.6 20.8 (1) Excludes the special items noted in footnote 2 to the table on page 9. Including the special items, return on average assets was 12.3% and return on average common equity was 17.5%. Both return on average assets and return on average common equity declined in 2001, primarily due to lower operating income as a result of consumer confidence issues regarding the European beef supply and weak operating results in APMEA and Latin America previously discussed. In general, returns benefited from the Companys continued focus on more efficient capital deployment. This included a more prudent site selection process, leasing a higher proportion of new sites, the U.S. building program and the use of free cash flow for share repurchases. In 2000, return on average common equity benefited from an increase in the average amount of common equity put options outstanding compared with 1999, which reduced average common equity. FINANCINGS AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. In managing the impact of these changes, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives used to minimize these risks were recorded at fair value in the Companys Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2001, and totaled $213 million in miscellaneous other assets and $134 million in other long term liabilities. See summary of significant accounting policies related to financial instruments on pages 27 28 for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No.133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. For example, foreign currency exchange agreements in conjunction with borrowings help obtain desired currencies at attractive rates and maturities. Interest rate exchange agreements effectively convert fixed rate to floating rate debt, or vice versa. The Company also manages the level of fixed rate debt to take advantage of changes in interest rates. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on net income and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $5.0 billion and $5.1 billion at year end 2001 and 2000, respectively. 18 McDonalds Corporation The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2001, neither the Company nor its counterparties was required to post collateral for any obligation. Debt highlights/(1)/ 2001 2000 1999 Fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt 45% 58% 70% Weighted average annual interest rate of total debt 5.4 5.8 5.9 Foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt 57 60 76 Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total shareholders equity) 48 48 43 (1) All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted average annual interest rate, which is for the year. Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch currently rate McDonalds debt Aa3, A+ and AA, respectively. A strong rating is important to the Company because of its global development plans. The Company has not experienced, and does not expect to experience, difficulty in obtaining financing or in refinancing existing debt. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross default provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings. At year end 2001, the Company had $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see debt financing note on page 31) as well as $1.2 billion under a U.S. shelf registration and $1.1 billion under a Euro Medium Term Notes program for future debt issuance. In early 2002, the Company issued $450 million of Medium Term Notes ($150 million at a rate of 4.15% due 2005 and $300 million at a rate of 5.75% due 2012) under the U.S. shelf registration to pay down commercial paper. At the time of these issuances, the Company entered into interest rate exchange agreements to convert fixed rate interest payments on the debt to a floating rate based on LIBOR. Also in early 2002, the Company redeemed $50 million of 6.0% Medium Term Notes originally due 2008. The notes were redeemed at 100% of principal plus accrued interest. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. The Company actively hedges selected currencies to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty and other payments received in the U.S. In addition, where practical, McDonalds restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges, and the Company typically finances in local currencies, creating economic hedges. The Companys exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. At year end 2001 and 2000, assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed in U.S. Dollars. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2001 2000 Euro $1,251 $1,185 British Pounds Sterling 786 638 Canadian Dollars 738 763 Australian Dollars 516 329 Brazilian Reais 490 491 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2001 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2001 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term contractual revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with our borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum contractual rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2001 (see discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources in McDonalds Corporation 19 Managements discussion and analysis as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details): Contractual cash flows Outflows Inflows Operating Debt Minimum rent under IN MILLIONS leases obligations/(1)/ franchise arrangements 2002 $ 841 $ 363 $ 1,669 2003 815 796 1,651 2004 779 1,621 1,624 2005 722 1,072 1,576 2006 690 844 1,532 Thereafter 6,069 4,128 13,368 Total $9,916 $8,824 $21,420 (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short term obligations to long term obligations of $750 million in 2004 and $500 million in 2007 as they are supported by long term line of credit agreements. Debt obligations do not include $94 million of fair value adjustments recorded as a result of SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In addition to long term obligations, the Company had certain other commitments at December 31, 2001. In connection with its share repurchase program, the Company had 12.2 million common equity put options outstanding at December 31, 2001, with a total exercise price of $350 million, of which 3.0 million were exercised in February 2002 at a cost of $87 million. The remaining options expire at various dates through November 2002 with exercise prices between $26.37 and $30.23. In addition, the Company entered into equity forward contracts, in connection with its share repurchase program, totaling $151 million for 5.5 million shares that settled in March 2002. The Company also guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $148 million. Other matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described on pages 26 28), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity. Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. Asset impairment In assessing the recoverability of the Companys fixed assets, goodwill and other non current assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Restructuring and litigation accruals In 2001, the Company recorded a $200 million pretax special charge related to strategic changes and ongoing restaurant initiatives in the U.S. and certain international markets. The accrual recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities. Although we do not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates. From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers and competitors. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Financial instruments The Companys derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate quoted market prices. The use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different results. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. 20 McDonalds Corporation Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $2.7 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Goodwill In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.141, Business Combinations, effective for acquisitions initiated on or after July 1, 2001, and No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No.141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations. SFAS No.142 indicates that goodwill (and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives) will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company began applying the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets January 1, 2002. Application of the nonamortization provisions of SFAS No.142 would have increased 2001 net income by approximately $30 million ($0.02 per share) and is expected to result in a similar increase in 2002. The Company is performing the first of required goodwill impairment tests as of January 1, 2002, and expects to record a non cash charge of about $100 million after tax ($0.08 per share), primarily in certain Latin American markets. The impairment charge required to be recognized upon adoption of SFAS No.142 will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. Long lived assets In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which provides additional guidance on the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The Company adopted the new rules as of January 1, 2002, and the adoption will not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. In hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices typically are adjusted to keep pace with inflation, mitigating the effect on reported results. EURO CONVERSION Twelve member countries of the European Union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies ("legacy currencies") and one common currency, the Euro. Since January 1, 2002, the new Euro denominated notes and coins are in circulation, and legacy currencies have been withdrawn from circulation. The Company has restaurants located in all member countries, and the conversion to the Euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions among the member countries, which for the Company primarily consists of payments to suppliers. In addition, because the Company uses foreign denominated debt and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and to reduce its foreign currency risks, certain of these financial instruments are denominated in Euro. The Company successfully addressed all issues involved with converting to the new currency, and the conversion did not have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
