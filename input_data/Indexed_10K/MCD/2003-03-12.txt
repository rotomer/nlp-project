Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NATURE OF BUSINESS The Company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates and franchises quick service restaurant businesses under the McDonalds brand (McDonalds restaurants). Approximately 80% of McDonalds restaurants and about 75% of the total revenues of McDonalds restaurants are in nine markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), the United Kingdom and the United States. Throughout this discussion, McDonalds restaurant businesses in these nine markets collectively are referred to as "major markets." The Company also operates other restaurant concepts under its Partner Brands: Boston Market, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Donatos Pizzeria. In addition, the Company has a minority ownership in Pret A Manger. In March 2002, the Company sold its Aroma Caf&eacute; business in the U.K. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Operating results 2002 2001 2000 DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA Amount Increase/(decrease) Amount Increase/(decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 11,500 4 % $ 11,041 5 % $ 10,467 Revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants 3,906 2 3,829 1 3,776 Total revenues 15,406 4 14,870 4 14,243 Operating costs and expenses Company operated restaurants 9,907 5 9,454 8 8,750 Franchised restaurants 840 5 800 4 772 Selling, general & administrative expenses 1,713 3 1,662 5 1,587 Other operating (income) expense, net 833 nm 257 nm (196 ) Total operating costs and expenses 13,293 9 12,173 12 10,913 Operating income 2,113 (22 ) 2,697 (19 ) 3,330 Interest expense 374 (17 ) 452 5 430 McDonalds Japan IPO gain nm (137 ) nm Nonoperating expense, net 77 48 52 nm 18 Income before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 1,662 (29 ) 2,330 (19 ) 2,882 Provision for income taxes 670 (3 ) 693 (23 ) 905 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 992 (39 ) 1,637 (17 ) 1,977 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (99 ) nm Net income $ 893 (45 )% $ 1,637 (17 )% $ 1,977 Per common share diluted: Income before cumulative effect of accounting change $ .77 (38 )% $ 1.25 (14 )% $ 1.46 Cumulative effect of accounting change (.07 ) nm Net income $ .70 (44 )% $ 1.25 (14 )% $ 1.46 nmNot meaningful. STRATEGIC ACTIONS In 2002, the Company initiated several strategic actions designed to optimize existing restaurant operations and improve the business. These actions were consistent with managements strategy of concentrating its capital and resources on the best near term opportunities and of avoiding those that distract from restaurant level execution. They included the restructuring of certain markets, the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants, the decision to terminate a long term technology project, and the consolidation of certain home office facilities and elimination of positions to control costs, streamline operations and reallocate resources. In 2001, the Company implemented strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the U.S. and certain international markets. The changes in the U.S. included streamlining operations by reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the Company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. The Company recorded charges and or gains associated with these actions in 2002 and 2001 as "significant items." Significant items generally represent charges and or gains for actions or transactions related to the implementation of special initiatives of the Company or items that are unusual or infrequent in nature. The Company does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends, 9 because management does not believe these are indicative of ongoing operations. The Company recorded $853 million of significant items in 2002 and $253 million of significant items in 2001. All significant items for both years were recorded in other operating expense, except as noted in the discussion that follows.

Restructuring charges restructuring markets and eliminating positions In 2002, the Company recorded $267 million of pretax charges related to transferring ownership in four countries in the Middle East and Latin America to developmental licensees (approximately 150 restaurants), ceasing operations in three countries in Latin America (approximately 20 restaurants), and eliminating positions (approximately 600 positions, about half of which were in the U.S. and half of which were in international markets), reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs. Under the developmental license business structure, which the Company successfully employs in more than 25 markets outside the U.S. (approximately 350 restaurants), the licensee owns the business, including the real estate interest. While the Company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales. The 2002 restructuring charges consisted of: $136 million of asset write offs and losses on the sale of assets and $65 million of costs for leases and other obligations in the markets restructured or exited, $56 million of severance and other employee related costs, $15 million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of certain home office facilities, and $10 million of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from U.S. franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future. These changes were partially offset by a $15 million reversal of accrued restructuring costs recorded in 2001, primarily due to lower employee related costs than originally estimated. In 2001, the Company recorded $200 million of pretax restructuring charges related to the strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the U.S. and certain international markets. The initiatives were designed to improve the restaurant experience and included accelerated operations training, restaurant simplification, incentives for outstanding restaurant operations and an enhanced national restaurant evaluation system. In connection with these initiatives, the Company eliminated approximately 850 positions, consisting of 700 positions in the U.S., primarily in the divisions and regions, and 150 positions in international markets. The 2001 restructuring charges consisted of: $114 million of severance and other employee related costs, $69 million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of region and division facilities, and $17 million of other cash costs, primarily consisting of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from U.S. franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future. Restaurant closings/asset impairment In 2002, the Company recorded $402 million of pretax charges consisting of: $302 million related to managements decision to close 751 underperforming restaurants (234 were closed in 2002 and 517 will close throughout 2003) primarily in the U.S. and Japan, and $100 million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in Europe and Latin America. Most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and or very low annual sales volumes. Also, in many cases they would have required significant capital investment over the next several years to remain financially viable. In 2001, the Company recorded $135 million of pretax charges consisting of: $91 million related to the closing of 163 underperforming restaurants in international markets in 2001, a $24 million asset impairment charge due to an assessment of the ongoing impact of Turkeys significant currency devaluation on our business, and $20 million related to the disposition of Aroma Caf&eacute; in the U.K. Although restaurant closings occur each year, these 2002 and 2001 restaurant closing charges are identified as "significant items" because they were the result of separate intensive reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions. Technology write offs and other charges In 2002, the Company recorded $184 million of pretax charges consisting of: $170 million primarily related to the write off of software development costs as a result of managements decision to terminate a long term technology project, and $14 million primarily related to the write off of receivables and inventory in Venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all McDonalds restaurants due to the national strike that began in early December. Although the terminated technology project was projected to deliver long term benefits, it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital in the current environment, as the anticipated Systemwide cost over several years was expected to be in excess of $1 billion. In 2001, the Company recorded $55 million of pretax charges consisting of: $18 million primarily related to the write off of certain technology, $12 million (recorded in nonoperating expense) primarily related to the write off of a corporate investment, and $25 million primarily related to 10 the unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the Companys Monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces. Fifty individuals (none of whom were Company employees) were convicted of conspiracy and or mail fraud charges. McDonalds Japan IPO gain In 2001, McDonalds Japan, the Companys largest market in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) segment, completed an IPO of 12 million shares. The Company owns 50% of McDonalds Japan, while the Companys founding partner Den Fujita and his family own approximately 26%. The Company recorded a $137 million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the IPO received by McDonalds Japan. EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds lessens exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies. Effect of foreign currency translation on consolidated reported results positive/(negative) DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 15 $ (457 ) $ (594 ) Operating income 90 (78 ) (151 ) Net income 42 (50 ) (92 ) Net income per common share diluted .04 (.04 ) (.07 ) In 2002, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on the revenue growth rate as the stronger Euro and British Pound were offset by weaker Latin American currencies (primarily the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real and Venezuelan Bolivar). The operating income growth rate for 2002 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger Euro and British Pound. In 2001, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on the growth rates primarily due to the weaker Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar. All information presented in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results except for hyperinflationary economies, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year average exchange rates. SYSTEMWIDE SALES Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint venture agreements. Management believes that Systemwide sales information is useful in analyzing the Companys revenues because franchisees and affiliates pay rent, service fees and or royalties that generally are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments.

Restaurant expansion, partly offset by negative comparable sales, drove the consolidated constant currency sales increases in 2002 and 2001. Sales in the U.S. increased in 2002 and 2001 due to expansion. Results in 2002 reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition. The primary contributors to Europes constant currency sales growth in both years were France and Russia. In addition, the U.K. contributed to the increases in 2002 and 2001, although comparable sales were negative in both years. Europes results for both years were impacted by negative comparable sales in Germany, where the economy continued to contract. We expect the difficult economic conditions in Germany to continue in the near term. In 2001, despite the Companys outstanding quality and safety record, Europes results were negatively impacted by consumer confidence issues regarding the European beef supply in several markets. Sales results in APMEA declined in 2002 in constant currencies primarily due to negative comparable sales in Japan, which were in part due to continuing weak economic conditions, partly offset by a strong performance in Australia and expansion in China. In 2001, the constant currency sales increase was driven by strong results in China, partly offset by weak results in Japan, Taiwan and Turkey, and weak consumer spending in Australia. Beginning in late 2001 and continuing in 2002, sales were also dampened by consumer confidence issues regarding food safety throughout Japan. In Latin America, constant currency sales increased in both 2002 and 2001, despite the fact that many markets continued to be impacted by weak economic conditions. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in Brazil and expansion in Mexico, while in 2001 positive comparable sales in Mexico and Venezuela drove the increase. The Company expects the weak economic conditions in many markets in APMEA (including Japan) and Latin America to continue in the near term. 11  In Canada, constant currency sales increased in 2002 due to expansion, partly offset by negative comparable sales, while the 2001 constant currency sales increase was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion. The sales increase in Partner Brands in 2002 was primarily due to expansion and positive comparable sales at Chipotle. The sales increase in 2001 was primarily due to the acquisition of Boston Market in second quarter 2000. In addition, expansion of Chipotle along with strong comparable sales at Chipotle and Boston Market helped drive the increase in 2001.

The number of new restaurants affects average sales because new restaurants typically take a few years to reach long term sales volumes. In addition, over the last several years more restaurants outside the U.S. have opened in less populated areas and in countries with lower average sales volumes and correspondingly lower average development costs.

(2) Excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results. (3) Satellite restaurants are primarily located in Japan and Canada. In 2002, average annual sales per traditional restaurant in the U.S. declined slightly primarily due to negative comparable sales. In Europe, average annual sales per traditional restaurant were relatively flat in constant currencies. In APMEA and Canada, average annual sales per traditional restaurant declined in constant currencies primarily due to negative comparable sales and the impact of new restaurants. In Latin America, average annual sales per traditional restaurant increased slightly in constant currencies due to positive comparable sales. All segments benefited from the closing of underperforming restaurants in 2002 and 2001. In 2001, average annual sales per traditional restaurant were relatively flat for the U.S. and Canada in constant currencies. In other segments, negative comparable sales and the significant number of new restaurants, partly offset by the benefit of closing underperforming restaurants, drove the decreases in average annual sales per traditional restaurant. Satellite restaurants generally have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes than traditional restaurants. The use of these small, limited menu restaurants has allowed profitable expansion into areas that otherwise would not be feasible (e.g., discount retail stores and airports). In 2002 and 2001, average annual sales for satellite restaurants increased in the U.S. This was due in part to our continued assessment of the appropriate use of these limited menu sites and the closing of certain low volume sites. Outside the U.S., average annual sales for satellite restaurants declined in constant currencies in both years primarily due to negative comparable sales in Japan, where the majority of satellites outside the U.S. are located. In connection with the restaurant closings previously discussed, the Companys Japanese affiliate will close more than 100 satellite restaurants in 2003. REVENUES Revenues include sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees or affiliates under joint venture agreements. These fees include rent, service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees. Fees vary by type of site and investment by the Company and also according to local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have 20 year terms. Revenues grow as sales build in existing restaurants and as new restaurants are added. Menu price changes also affect revenues and sales, but it is impractical to quantify their impact because of different pricing structures, new products, promotions and product mix variations among restaurants and markets. Systemwide sales and revenues may grow at different rates during a given period, primarily due to a change in the mix of Company operated, franchised and affiliated restaurants. For example, this mix is impacted by purchases and sales of restaurants between the Company and franchisees. Company operated restaurants generated about 30% of Systemwide sales and about 75% of revenues for all periods presented. 12 Revenues 2002 2001 2000 Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) DOLLARS IN MILLIONS As reported amount As reported Constant currency(1) As reported amount As reported Constant currency(1) As reported amount Company operated sales: U.S. $ 3,172 1 % na $ 3,139 2 % na $ 3,064 Europe 3,982 7 2 % 3,727 4 % 3,730 APMEA 2,115 9 8 1,938 4 11 1,857 Latin America 696 (15 ) 12 821 7 18 764 Canada 505 6 7 478 (2 ) 2 490 Partner Brands 1,030 10 10 938 67 67 562 Total Company operated sales $ 11,500 4 % 4 % $ 11,041 5 % 9 % $ 10,467 Franchised and affiliated revenues: U.S. $ 2,251 na $ 2,257 3 % na $ 2,195 Europe 1,154 13 % 6 % 1,025 4 % 1,024 APMEA 253 (5 ) (6 ) 265 8 21 245 Latin America 118 (21 ) (8 ) 150 (19 ) (11 ) 185 Canada 128 (2 ) 130 4 8 125 Partner Brands 2 2 2 Total franchised and affiliated revenues $ 3,906 2 % 1 % $ 3,829 1 % 4 % $ 3,776 Total revenues: U.S. $ 5,423 1 % na $ 5,396 3 % na $ 5,259 Europe 5,136 8 3 % 4,752 4 % 4,754 APMEA 2,368 7 7 2,203 5 12 2,102 Latin America 814 (16 ) 9 971 2 12 949 Canada 633 4 6 608 (1 ) 3 615 Partner Brands 1,032 10 10 940 67 67 564 Total revenues $ 15,406 4 % 4 % $ 14,870 4 % 8 % $ 14,243 (1)Excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported revenues. na Not applicable. On a constant currency basis, total revenues increased at a higher rate than Systemwide sales in 2002 primarily due to significantly lower sales from our affiliate in Japan. Under our affiliate structure, we record a royalty in revenues based on a percentage of Japans sales, whereas all of Japans sales are included in Systemwide sales. For this reason, Japans sales decline had a larger negative impact on Systemwide sales than on revenues. In 2001, total revenues increased at a higher rate than Systemwide sales primarily due to the second quarter 2000 acquisition of Boston Market restaurants, which were all Company operated, and the restructuring of our ownership in the Philippines, effective July 1, 2001. As a result of the restructuring, most of our restaurants in the Philippines are now Company operated rather than franchised. In addition, revenues in 2001 benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received from our Japanese affiliate, effective January 1, 2001. In the U.S., growth rates for Systemwide sales and total revenues were similar in 2002 and 2001. In both periods, Europes total revenue growth rates were lower than the Systemwide sales growth rates primarily due to a lower percentage of Company operated restaurants and an increase in rent assistance to franchisees compared with the prior year. APMEAs total revenue growth rates were higher than the Systemwide sales growth rates for both periods primarily due to our affiliate structure in Japan and a higher percentage of Company operated restaurants, in part due to the restructuring of the Philippines. In addition, the total revenue growth rate in 2001 benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received from our Japanese affiliate. In Latin America, total revenue growth rates were higher than Systemwide sales growth rates for both periods primarily due to a higher percentage of Company operated restaurants compared with the prior year. OPERATING INCOME Consolidated operating income decreased $584 million or 22% in 2002 and $633 million or 19% in 2001; however, significant charges of $853 million in 2002 and $378 million in 2001 were included in operating income. Operating income for both years included higher selling, general & administrative expenses and lower other operating income. Combined operating margin dollars were higher in 2002 than in 2001 and lower in 2001 than in 2000. Operating income from the major markets accounted for substantially all of consolidated operating income in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The following table presents reported operating income amounts and growth rates along with the growth rates adjusted for foreign currency translation and significant items. Adjusted constant currency operating income is one of the primary measures used to evaluate segment performance, because management believes that adjusted constant currency operating income reflects the most accurate representation of ongoing business operations.

The decrease in 2002 was due to lower combined operating margin dollars and lower other operating income, partly offset by lower selling, general & administrative expenses. Other operating income included $22 million of payments made to U.S. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter team service system. In 2001, higher combined operating margin dollars were offset by higher selling, general & administrative expenses and slightly lower other operating income. U.S. adjusted operating income accounted for more than 50% of consolidated adjusted operating income in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Europes adjusted operating income accounted for more than 35% of consolidated adjusted operating income in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Europes adjusted operating income was relatively flat in 2002 compared with 2001 and decreased 3% in 2001. The segments results benefited from strong performances in France and Russia in both years; however, difficult economic conditions in Germany and weak results in the U.K. negatively impacted results. In 2001, consumer confidence issues regarding the European beef supply negatively impacted Europes results. France, Germany and the U.K. accounted for about 75% of Europes adjusted operating income in all three years. APMEAs adjusted operating income decreased 23% in 2002 and 10% in 2001. In 2002, strong results in Australia were more than offset by weak results in Japan and Hong Kong. In 2001, strong results in China, the increase in the royalty percent received from our affiliate in Japan and a gain on the sale of real estate in Singapore were more than offset by weak results in Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Turkey. Australia, Japan and China accounted for about 70% of APMEAs adjusted operating income in all three years. Latin Americas adjusted operating income declined significantly for both periods due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by most markets in the segment. In addition, Latin Americas results in 2002 were negatively impacted by a higher provision for uncollectible receivables as well as the temporary closure of all McDonalds restaurants in Venezuela due to the national strike that began in early December 2002. Although the strike ended in February 2003, the Company expects the continued turmoil in Venezuela to impact results in 2003. The adjusted operating results for the Partner Brands improved 22% in 2002 and were flat in 2001 compared with 2000. The improvement in 2002 was primarily driven by the elimination of goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002 and continued strong results at Chipotle. The Corporate segment reflected higher spending on technology in 2002 and 2001. OPERATING MARGINS Operating margin information and discussions relate to McDonalds restaurants only and exclude Partner Brands. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars represent sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars declined $12 million in 2002 and $145 million in 2001. In constant currencies, Company operated margin dollars declined $41 million or 3% in 2002 and $96 million or 6% in 2001. 14 The constant currency decreases in both years were primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher labor rates, partly offset by expansion.

The U.S. Company operated margin percent in 2002 benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization and a lower contribution rate to the national co op for advertising expenses. However, these benefits were offset by negative comparable sales and higher labor costs. Food & paper costs were lower as a percent of sales in 2002 and 2001, while payroll costs were higher in both years. Occupancy & other operating expenses as a percent of sales were lower in 2002 than in 2001 and higher in 2001 than in 2000. Europes Company operated margins as a percent of sales declined in 2002, primarily due to higher payroll and occupancy costs, partly offset by lower food & paper costs as a percent of sales. In 2001, Europes Company operated margin percent declined, primarily due to higher payroll costs and negative comparable sales. In APMEA, negative comparable sales in 2002 and 2001 affected Company operated margins as a percent of sales. In 2001, a change in restaurant classification in the Philippines also contributed to APMEAs margin decline because its Company operated margins were lower than the average for the segment. In Latin America, declines in margins as a percent of sales in both years were due to difficult economic conditions in most markets. In Canada, negative comparable sales in 2002 affected Company operated margins as a percent of sales. Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented more than 60% of the combined operating margins in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Franchised margin dollars increased $36 million in 2002 and $26 million in 2001. In constant currencies, franchised margin dollars were relatively flat in 2002 and increased $91 million or 3% in 2001. The constant currency increase in 2001 was primarily driven by expansion and an increase in the Japan royalty percent.

APMEAs franchised margin percent in both years benefited from the restructuring of our ownership in the Philippines in July 2001. The restructuring resulted in the reclassification of restaurants and related margins, that were lower than the average for the segment, from franchised to Company operated. In addition, the franchised margin percent in APMEA in 2001 benefited from the increase in the Japan royalty percent. 15 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 3% in 2002 and 5% in 2001 (4% and 7% in constant currencies). The increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased spending on technology in the Corporate segment, higher advertising expenses in the U.S. primarily related to the introduction of the Dollar Menu, and higher expenses for Partner Brands. The increase in 2001 was due to increased spending on technology in the Corporate segment and higher expenses for Partner Brands, partly offset by lower Company wide performance based incentive compensation compared with the prior year. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 4.1% in 2002 and 2001 and 4.0% in 2000.

OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense includes gains on sales of restaurant businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, restructuring charges, restaurant closings/asset impairment charges and other transactions related to franchising and the food service business.

Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses). The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are an integral part of our business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. The decrease in 2002 was due to a net loss from our Japanese affiliate. The decrease in 2001 was due to lower earnings from our Japanese affiliate, the increase in Japans royalty expense and a weaker Japanese Yen. Although the increase in royalty expense reduced McDonalds equity in earnings for Japan in 2001 compared with 2000, it was more than offset at the operating income level by the royalty benefit McDonalds received in franchised revenues. Team service system payments In 2002, the Company made payments to U.S. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter team service system. Bad debts and other expense Bad debts and other expense for 2002 and 2001 increased primarily due to higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in Europe and Latin America). In addition, other expense for 2002 was partly offset by a benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased in 2002 due to lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies. Interest expense increased in 2001 due to higher average debt levels, partly offset by weaker foreign currencies and lower average interest rates. Average debt levels were higher in both years because the Company used its available credit capacity to repurchase shares of its common stock. NONOPERATING EXPENSE, NET Nonoperating expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income, minority interests, and gains and losses related to other investments, financings and translation. Nonoperating expense in 2002 reflected higher minority interest expense and foreign currency translation losses in 2002 compared with foreign currency translation gains in 2001. In addition, nonoperating expense in 2001 included $12 million primarily related to the write off of a corporate investment as well as minority interest expense related to the sale of real estate in Singapore. 16  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The following table presents the reported effective income tax rates as well as the effective income tax rates excluding significant items. 2002 2001 2000 Reported effective income tax rates 40.3 % 29.8 % 31.4 % Impact of significant items(1) (7.6 ) 1.3 Effective income tax rates, excluding significant items 32.7 % 31.1 % 31.4 % (1)Certain significant items were not tax affected for financial reporting purposes. See page 9 for discussion of significant items. The 2001 effective income tax rate reflected a benefit from the impact of tax law changes in certain international markets and the 2000 effective income tax rate reflected a tax benefit resulting from an international transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $867 million in 2002 and $720 million in 2001. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. As a result of the initial required goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a noncash charge of $99 million after tax ($0.07 per diluted share) in first quarter 2002 to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change. The impaired goodwill was primarily in Argentina, Uruguay and other markets in Latin America and the Middle East, where economies have weakened significantly in recent years. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE In 2002, income before the cumulative effect of the goodwill accounting change decreased $645 million or 39%, and diluted income per common share before the cumulative effect of this accounting change decreased $0.48 or 38%. Net income, which included the charge for the cumulative effect of the accounting change decreased 45% and diluted net income per common share decreased 44%. In 2001, net income decreased $340 million or 17% and diluted net income per common share decreased $0.21 or 14%. Results for 2002 included significant charges of $700 million or $0.55 per share, and results for 2001 included significant items totaling $143 million or $0.11 of expense per share discussed on page 9. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending. Cash from operations totaled $2.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $886 million in 2002, while cash from operations totaled $2.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $782 million in 2001. Cash provided by operations, along with borrowings and other sources of cash, is used for capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments. The Company expects to use future cash provided by operations to fund the remaining employee severance and lease obligations associated with the significant charges in 2002 and 2001. Cash provided by operations DOLLARS IN MILLIONS 2002 2001 2000 Cash provided by operations $ 2,890 $ 2,688 $ 2,751 Cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures 144 % 141 % 141 % Cash provided by operations as a percent of average total debt 31 % 31 % 35 % In addition to its cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Accordingly, the Company purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio, which was .71 at year end 2002.

In 2002, the Company opened 1,247 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 392 satellite restaurants, and closed 474 traditional restaurants and 158 satellite restaurants. In 2001, the Company opened 1,406 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 383 satellite restaurants, and closed 335 traditional restaurants and 135 satellite restaurants. In 2002, about 85% of McDonalds restaurant additions occurred in the major markets. Approximately 60% of Company operated restaurants and more than 85% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2002. Franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of 17 McDonalds restaurants at year end 2002. Partner Brand restaurants are primarily Company operated. Capital expenditures increased $98 million or 5% in 2002 and decreased $39 million or 2% in 2001. The increase in capital expenditures in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending for McDonalds restaurant business in the U.S. and Canada, partly offset by lower capital expenditures for new restaurants in Latin America. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower spending in Europe and Latin America and weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by additional expenditures for Partner Brands as well as for McDonalds restaurant business in the U.S. and China. Capital expenditures for McDonalds restaurants in 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflected our strategy of leasing a higher proportion of new sites and also the U.S. building program, which gave franchisees the option to own new restaurant buildings. The Companys expenditures for new restaurants in the U.S. were lower than they would have been as a result of the leasing strategy and the U.S. building program. About 65% in 2002 and 80% in 2001 of new and rebuilt U.S. traditional franchised and affiliated restaurant buildings were purchased by franchisees and affiliates. Beginning in 2003, to give our best franchisees additional financial flexibility to purchase more McDonalds restaurant businesses as well as to reinvest in their existing restaurants, the Company plans to purchase buildings for new franchised restaurants. As a result of owning the buildings, the Company expects to collect additional rent from the franchisees. In addition, the Company is purchasing a higher proportion of land for new restaurants in the U.S. The Company and its affiliates owned 38% of the land for its restaurant sites at year end 2002 and 2001. For leased land, the Company maintains long term occupancy rights for the land and receives related rental income. Capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding Japan represented approximately 70% of the total in 2002 and 60% in 2001 and 2000. (Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly, its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.)

(2) Primarily for computer equipment and furnishings for office buildings. Average development costs incurred by the U.S. System (land, building and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants were $1.7 million in 2002 and 2001 and $1.6 million in 2000. Average development costs outside the U.S. vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment owned by the Company, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, standardization and global sourcing. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Average development costs for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in major markets outside the U.S. excluding Japan were approximately $1.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Average annual sales for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the same markets were about $1.3 million in 2002 and 2001 and $1.5 million in 2000. Average development costs for new satellite restaurants (excluding lease costs) located in Canada, Germany and Japan, which comprise about 95% of the satellites outside the U.S., were about $250,000 in 2002 and about $220,000 in 2001 and 2000. The use of these small, limited menu restaurants, for which the land and building generally are leased, has allowed expansion into areas that otherwise would not have been feasible. Capital expenditures by affiliates in international markets, primarily Japan, which were not included in consolidated amounts, were about $204 million in 2002, $181 million in 2001 and $204 million in 2000. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company and six unaffiliated companies that supply the "McDonalds System" (McDonalds franchisees, suppliers and the Company) are equal owners of System Capital Corporation (SCC). SCCs purpose is to provide funding to McDonalds franchisees, suppliers to the McDonalds System and McDonalds Corporation and to build equity within SCC that will benefit the McDonalds System. No employees of SCC are employees of the seven shareholders. SCC competes with other lenders who provide similar financing to McDonalds franchisees and suppliers and the Company has no independent obligation to provide financing to these franchisees and suppliers. SCCs function is similar to that of a cooperative and its primary operating activities include (1) providing loans to qualifying U.S. franchisees to purchase existing restaurant businesses as well as finance equipment, buildings and working capital, (2) purchasing accounts receivable and financing inventory and other needs of eligible suppliers and distributors, and (3) acquiring land and leasing it to McDonalds Corporation for new restaurants, primarily in the U.S. SCC assets totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2002. See summary of significant accounting policies on page 31 for further details on SCC. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS During 2002, the Company purchased 25.6 million shares of McDonalds stock for approximately $687 million, of which 20.1 million shares for $536 million were under a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2001 and 2000, the Company sold 12.2 million and 16.8 million common equity put options, respectively, in connection with its share repurchase program. Premiums received were recorded in shareholders equity as a reduction of the cost of treasury stock purchased and were $32 million 18 in 2001 and $56 million in 2000. In 2002, 10.1 million common equity put options were exercised and 2.1 million options expired unexercised, while 21.0 million options were exercised in 2001. The total amount paid to acquire these shares as a result of the options being exercised was $286 million in 2002 and $700 million in 2001. At December 31, 2002, there were no common equity put options outstanding. At December 31, 2001, the $350 million total exercise price of outstanding options was classified in common equity put options and forward contracts in the Consolidated balance sheet, and the related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received. During 2001, the Company also entered into equity forward contracts in connection with its share repurchase program. At December 31, 2001, the $151 million total purchase price of the forward contracts was classified in common equity put options and forward contracts in the Consolidated balance sheet, and the related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury. The forward contracts for 5.5 million shares settled in March 2002, and there were no additional forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 27 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations, financing needs and tax treatment of dividends. Cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. As in the past, future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets grew by $1.4 billion or 6% in 2002 and $851 million or 4% in 2001. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $785 million in 2002 and decreased total assets by approximately $765 million in 2001. At year end 2002 and 2001, approximately 65% of consolidated assets was located in the major markets excluding Japan. Net property and equipment rose $1.3 billion in 2002 and represented 78% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income before cumulative effect of accounting change is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2002 2001 2000 Return on average assets 9.2 % 12.3 % 15.9 % Return on average common equity 8.9 17.5 21.6 Adjusted return on average assets(1) 12.9 % 14.1 % na Adjusted return on average common equity(1) 16.8 19.1 na (1)Excludes the significant items noted on page 9. na Not applicable. Return on average assets and return on average common equity both declined in 2002 and 2001, primarily due to weak operating results in APMEA and Latin America. During 2003, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonalds restaurant openings in markets with acceptable returns and will significantly reduce the amount of capital we invest in APMEA and Latin America, where returns have been pressured in recent years by weak economies. FINANCINGS AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2002 totaled $10.0 billion compared with $8.9 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase in 2002 was due to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($645 million), SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments ($271 million), and an increase in net borrowings ($145 million). Debt highlights(1) 2002 2001 2000 Fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt(2) 62 % 45 % 58 % Weighted average annual interest rate of total debt 4.1 5.4 5.8 Foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt(2) 64 57 60 Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total shareholders equity) 49 48 48 (1) All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted average annual interest rate, which is for the year. (2) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements, and excludes the effect of SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustments. Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch currently rate McDonalds commercial paper P 1, A 1 and F1 and its long term debt A2, A+ and A, respectively. The Company has not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum net worth (defined as consolidated assets less consolidated liabilities) of $5 billion to comply with its line of credit agreements. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings. The Company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see debt financing note on page 35) as well as $1.8 billion under a U.S. shelf registration and $700 million under a Euro Medium Term Notes program for future debt issuance. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. 19 The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In December 2002, the Company terminated certain interest rate exchange agreements to effectively create fixed rate financing for $1.8 billion of debt at interest rates that were near all time low yields, and to reduce the potential exposure in the Companys future interest expense due to a rise in interest rates. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Companys Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002 as follows: miscellaneous other assets $134 million; other long term liabilities (excluding interest) $39 million; and accrued payroll and other liabilities $24 million. See summary of significant accounting policies related to financial instruments on page 29 for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.2 billion and $5.0 billion at year end 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. During 2002, certain counterparties were required to post collateral as aggregate exposures exceeded certain contractual limits due to increased values. At December 31, 2002, collateral in the amount of $2.2 million was posted by a counterparty while the Company was not required to collateralize any of its obligations. The Company actively hedges selected currencies to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty and other payments received in the U.S. In addition, where practical, McDonalds restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges, and the Company typically finances in local currencies, creating economic hedges. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. At year end 2002 and 2001, assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed in U.S. Dollars. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2002 2001 Euro $ 1,536 $ 1,251 British Pounds Sterling 700 786 Canadian Dollars 808 738 Australian Dollars 620 516 Brazilian Reais 385 490 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2002 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2002 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with our borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2002. (See discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the December 31, 2002 consolidated financial statements for further details.) 20 Contractual cash flows Outflows Inflows IN MILLIONS Operating leases Debt obligations(1) Minimum rent under franchise arrangements 2003 $ 913 $ 337 $ 1,735 2004 848 975 1,707 2005 789 2,017 1,662 2006 735 1,014 1,613 2007 683 663 1,566 Thereafter 6,059 4,609 13,127 Total $ 10,027 $ 9,615 $ 21,410 (1)The maturities reflect reclassifications of short term obligations to long term obligations of $810 million in 2005 and $500 million thereafter as they are supported by long term line of credit agreements. Debt obligations do not include $365 million of SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustments. In addition to long term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $102 million at December 31, 2002. OUTLOOK FOR 2003 The Companys strategies for 2003 are designed to reverse the negative comparable sales trend through a heightened focus on restaurant level execution and marketing. The Companys outlook remains cautious until we see improved performance in our major markets. As a guideline, generally one percentage point of comparable sales in the U.S. impacts annual earnings per share by 1.5 cents and one percentage point of comparable sales in Europe impacts annual earnings per share by about 1 cent, assuming no change in profit margins. The Company expects the total amount of selling, general & administrative expenses in 2003 to be relatively flat in constant currencies compared with 2002. A significant part of McDonalds operating income is from outside the U.S. and more than 60% of total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. The Euro and the British Pound are the most significant currencies impacting our business. If the Euro and the British Pound move 10% (compared with 2002 average rates), McDonalds annual reported earnings per share would change by about 4 cents to 5 cents. The Company expects to decrease its debt level in 2003, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The Company expects its 2003 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. The Company is currently reviewing its previously announced plans for capital expenditures and restaurant openings for 2003 and expects to reduce both its capital expenditures and restaurant openings compared with 2002. The plans are expected to be finalized and communicated in early April. OTHER MATTERS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity. (See summary of significant accounting policies more fully described on pages 28 through 32.) Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods. Long lived assets Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If the Companys estimates or the underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. 21 Restructuring and litigation accruals In 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded charges related to restructuring markets, eliminating positions and strategic changes. The accruals recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities. Although the Company does not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates. From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers and competitors. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $3.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Asset retirement obligations In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. The Statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost will be capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. Application of the new rules, which for the Company relates to lease obligations in certain international markets, is expected to result in a cumulative effect of adoption in the first quarter 2003 that will reduce net income and shareholders equity by approximately $30 million to $40 million. The adoption of the new rules is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys ongoing results of operations or financial position. Variable interest entities In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN No. 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which requires an enterprise to consolidate or make certain disclosures about variable interest entities that meet certain criteria, effective July 1, 2003. The Company is currently performing an analysis to determine the applicability of FIN No. 46 to SCC. See summary of significant accounting policies on page 31 for further details. Effects of changing prices inflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. In hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices typically are adjusted to keep pace with inflation, mitigating the effect on reported results.
