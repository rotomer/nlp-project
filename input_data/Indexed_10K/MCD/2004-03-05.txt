Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company primarily operates and franchises McDonalds restaurants. In addition, the Company operates certain non McDonalds brands that are not material to the Companys overall results. Of the more than 30,000 McDonalds restaurants in over 100 countries, more than 8,000 are operated by the Company, approximately 18,000 are operated by franchisees and about 4,000 are operated by affiliates under license agreements. Regardless of who operates the restaurant, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures long term leases for restaurant sites. This ensures long term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. Fees vary by type of site, investment by the Company and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have 20 year terms. We manage the business based on geographic segments: United States; Europe; Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA); Latin America and Canada. In addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled Other that includes non McDonalds brands. The U.S. and Europe segments account for approximately 70% of total revenues. France, Germany and the United Kingdom account for about 65% of Europes revenues; Australia, China and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method) account for about 45% of APMEAs revenues; and Brazil accounts for about 40% of Latin Americas revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including Systemwide sales growth, comparable sales growth and Company operated margins. Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because they are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all Systemwide restaurants in operation at least thirteen months. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the Company believes they better represent the underlying business trends. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND 2003 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE In 2001 and 2002, the Companys results reflected a focus on growth through adding new restaurants, with associated high levels of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt financing. This strategy, combined with challenging economic conditions and increased competition in certain key markets, adversely affected results and returns on investment. In 2003, the Company introduced a comprehensive revitalization plan to increase McDonalds relevance to todays consumers as well as improve our financial discipline. We redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants. In line with this, we took a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and put a greater emphasis on controlling expenses. We aligned the System around our customer focused Plan to Win, designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing. This Plan contains aggressive goals and measures for success based on the five drivers of exceptional customer experiences people, products, place, price and promotion. Our near term goal was to fortify the foundation of our business. Our long term goal is to create a differentiated customer experience one that builds brand loyalty and enables us to deliver attractive top and bottom line growth and returns on a sustained basis. For 2005 and beyond, McDonalds is targeting annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, annual operating income growth of 6 percent to 7 percent and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. (Return on incremental invested capital is the change in operating income plus depreciation divided by the change in gross assets.) These targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. We made significant progress in 2003 in operational excellence and leadership marketing. We improved our core menu and added several successful new products. We used more consistent, rigorous measurements such as evaluations by Company personnel, independent mystery shoppers and customer research to evaluate restaurant performance. Using this information, along with enhanced training and other processes, we have strengthened our operations. We have expanded our everyday value offerings, attracting more customer visits. We began to create more relevant McDonalds Corporation 9 restaurant environments by updating, rebuilding and relocating some of our restaurants. We also introduced our first global marketing strategy, embodied by the im lovin it theme, which emphasizes more contemporary music and images and is connecting with both our customers and our employees. From a financial perspective, our results also improved in 2003. In concert with the Companys strategic shift to emphasize growth from existing restaurants, management is focusing in particular on comparable sales and Company operated margin trends, both of which gained momentum during the year. Performance in the U.S. was impressive, with robust annual comparable sales and margin increases. In Europe, while comparable sales were slightly negative for the year, they improved sequentially each quarter, as did Company operated margins, compared with the prior year. APMEAs comparable sales and Company operated margins declined for the year, but both showed significant improvement in the second half. As part of the Companys revitalization plan, we eliminated projects not directly affecting our customers experience and narrowed non McDonalds brand activities. These actions along with the write down of a portion of our goodwill and restaurant assets resulted in the Company recording $408 million of pretax charges (primarily noncash) in 2003. Highlights from the year included: Comparable sales increased 2.4%, a significant improvement over the 2.1% decline in 2002. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to a new record high of $17 billion. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, revenues increased 6%. Systemwide sales increased 11%. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, Systemwide sales increased 5%. Net income per common share totaled $1.15, compared with $0.70 in 2002. Company operated margins as a percent of sales improved 10 basis points, progressing toward our goal of increasing margins by 35 basis points per year beginning in 2005. Cash from operations increased $400 million to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by higher sales at existing restaurants and stronger foreign currencies. Capital expenditures were reduced by $700 million to $1.3 billion. Debt pay down totaled approximately $900 million. The annual dividend increased 70% to more than $500 million. Share repurchases totaled about $440 million. OUTLOOK FOR 2004 We expect 2004 to be a year of ongoing progress in operational excellence, leadership marketing and key financial metrics. We will continue to focus our revitalization efforts on improving our customers experiences by providing better service, enhancing food taste, menu variety and value offerings, and creating more relevant marketing. While we are confident in our plans for 2004, we also are conscious of the challenges we face. For example, we must continue to deliver solid results in the U.S., a very competitive marketplace, despite sequentially more difficult sales comparisons. We believe that the combination of initiatives that benefited our U.S. business in 2003 will continue to create positive momentum in 2004. Outside the U.S., some key markets must increase customer relevance, while others have economic challenges. We believe that we are in a better position to overcome these issues today than we have been for some time. Our plan is to leverage successes in the U.S. and other markets like Australia such as more relevant menus, strong value platforms, creative marketing and better restaurant level execution to improve results in additional markets around the world. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results. Changes in constant currency Systemwide sales are driven by restaurant unit expansion and changes in comparable sales. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately one percentage point to sales and operating income growth in 2004 (in constant currencies). Most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in 2003. The Company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure a one percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about 2 cents. Similarly, an increase of one percentage point in Europes comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about 1.5 cents. The Company expects full year 2004 selling, general & administrative expenses to be relatively flat to up slightly in constant currencies and to decline as a percent of revenues and Systemwide sales, compared with 2003. However, due to the timing of certain expenses, the Company expects selling, general & administrative expenses to increase in the first half of 2004 and to decline in the second half, compared with 2003. A significant part of the Companys operating income is from outside the U.S., and more than 70% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction (compared with 2003 average rates), 10 McDonalds Corporation the Companys annual earnings per share would change by about 5 cents to 6 cents. In 2003, foreign currency translation benefited earnings per share by 7 cents. For 2004, the Company expects its net debt principal repayments to be approximately $400 million to $700 million. However, despite lower average debt balances, the Company expects interest expense to be relatively flat compared with 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for 2004 to be between 32.5% and 33.5%. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2004 to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. The Company expects to return about $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2004. A number of factors can affect our business, including effectiveness of operating initiatives and changes in global and local business and economic conditions. These and other risks are noted in the Forward looking statements at the end of Managements discussion and analysis.

STRATEGIC ACTIONS In 2003, the Company eliminated projects not directly impacting its customers experience, narrowed its non McDonalds brand activities, aligned its System around a single action plan (Plan to Win), and re established McDonalds marketing leadership through the introduction of its first ever global brand strategy embodied by the im lovin it theme. These actions were consistent with managements strategy of concentrating the Companys capital and resources on the best near term opportunities and avoiding those that distract from restaurant level execution. In 2002, the Company initiated actions designed to optimize restaurant operations and improve the business. They included the restructuring of certain international markets, the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants, the decision to terminate a long term technology project, and the consolidation of certain home office facilities and elimination of positions to control costs, streamline operations and reallocate resources. McDonalds Corporation 11 In 2001, the Company also implemented structural changes and restaurant initiatives, primarily in the U.S. The changes included streamlining operations by reducing the number of U.S. regions and divisions, enabling the Company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. The Company recorded charges associated with certain of the above actions as special items. Special items generally represent actions or transactions related to the implementation of strategic initiatives of the Company, items that are unusual or infrequent in nature (such as the dispositions of certain non McDonalds brands in 2003 and the Japan IPO gain in 2001), and charges resulting from annual goodwill and asset impairment testing. McDonalds management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because they do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results. On a pretax basis, the Company recorded $408 million of special charges in 2003, $853 million of special charges in 2002 and $253 million of special items in 2001. All special items were recorded in other operating expense, except as noted in the discussion that follows.

The Company expects to use cash provided by operations to fund the remaining employee severance and lease obligations associated with the special charges. (2) Certain special items were not tax effected. Restructuring In 2003, the Company recorded $272 million of pretax charges consisting of: $237 million related to the loss on the sale of Donatos Pizzeria, the closing of all Donatos and Boston Market restaurants outside the U.S. and the exit of a domestic joint venture with Fazolis; and $35 million related to revitalization plan actions of McDonalds Japan, including headcount reductions, the closing of Pret A Manger stores in Japan, and the early termination of a long term management services agreement. In 2002, the Company recorded $267 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $201 million related to the anticipated transfer of ownership in five countries in the Middle East and Latin America to developmental licensees and ceasing operations in two countries in Latin America; $81 million primarily related to eliminating approximately 600 positions (about half of which were in the U.S. and half of which were in international markets), reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs; and a $15 million favorable adjustment to the 2001 restructuring charge due to lower employee related costs than originally anticipated. Under the developmental license business structure, which the Company successfully employs in about 30 markets outside the U.S. (approximately 400 restaurants), the licensee owns the business, including the real estate interest. While the Company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales. In 2001, the Company recorded $200 million of pretax restructuring charges related to initiatives designed to improve the restaurant experience, primarily in the U.S. These initiatives included streamlining operations by reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the Company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. In connection with these initiatives, the Company eliminated approximately 850 positions (700 in the U.S., primarily in the divisions and regions, and 150 in international markets). Restaurant closings/asset impairment In 2003, the Company recorded $136 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $148 million primarily related to asset/goodwill impairment, mainly in Latin America; $30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in Latin America; and a $42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings, primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated. The lower closings were primarily due to managements reassessment of the plans as a result of the new strategic direction of the Company. In 2002, the Company recorded $402 million of pretax charges consisting of: $302 million related to managements decision to close 751 underperforming restaurants primarily in the U.S. and Japan; and $100 million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in Europe and Latin America. Most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and or very low annual sales volumes. Also, in many cases they would have required significant capital investment to remain financially viable. 12 McDonalds Corporation In 2001, the Company recorded $135 million of pretax charges consisting of: $91 million related to the closing of 163 underperforming restaurants in international markets; a $24 million asset impairment charge in Turkey; and $20 million related to the disposition of Aroma Caf&eacute; in the U.K. Although restaurant closings occur each year, these restaurant closing charges in each year were identified as special charges because they were the result of separate intensive reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions. Other In 2002, the Company recorded $184 million of pretax charges consisting of: $170 million primarily related to the write off of software development costs as a result of managements decision to terminate a long term technology project; and $14 million primarily related to the write off of receivables and inventory in Venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all McDonalds restaurants due to a national strike. Although the terminated technology project was expected to deliver long term benefits, it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital, as the anticipated Systemwide cost over several years was expected to be more than $1 billion. In 2001, the Company recorded $55 million of pretax charges consisting of: $18 million primarily related to the write off of certain technology costs; $12 million (recorded in nonoperating expense) primarily related to the write off of a corporate investment; and $25 million primarily related to the unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the Companys Monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces. Fifty individuals (none of whom were Company employees) were convicted of conspiracy and or mail fraud charges. McDonalds Japan IPO gain In 2001, McDonalds Japan, the Companys 50% owned affiliate, completed an IPO of 12 million shares. The Company recorded a $137 million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the IPO received by McDonalds Japan. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds lessens exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2003, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and earnings per share due to the strengthening of several major currencies, primarily the Euro. In 2002, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on revenues as the stronger Euro and British Pound were offset by weaker Latin American currencies (primarily the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real and Venezuelan Bolivar). Operating income in 2002 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger Euro and British Pound.

These initiatives included the introduction of Premium Salads and McGriddles breakfast sandwiches, the Dollar Menu, extended hours, a heightened focus on operations, more disciplined measurements and a new marketing direction. Results also reflected improvement in the U.S. economy in 2003. In 2002, revenues increased slightly due to restaurant expansion. Results in 2002, in part, reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition. In 2003 and 2002, Europes revenues reflected strong performance in Russia driven by expansion and positive comparable sales, along with expansion in France. These results were partly offset by weak results in the U.K. and Germany, although Germanys performance improved in the second half of 2003. In 2003 and 2002, APMEAs revenues benefited from positive comparable sales in Australia and expansion in China. Revenues were negatively affected in 2003 by weak results in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, compounded by consumer concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in several markets in the first half of the year. In addition, Japan had negative comparable sales for 2003 and 2002, although the markets performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2002, revenues reflected a benefit from the restructuring of our ownership in the Philippines, effective July 2001, that resulted in the reclassification of franchised restaurants to Company operated. In Latin America, revenues in 2003 increased in constant currencies primarily due to a higher percentage of Company operated restaurants. The increase in revenues in 2002 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in Brazil and expansion in Mexico. 14 McDonalds Corporation The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and the increase or decrease in comparable sales.

In 2003, U.S. operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars, higher selling, general & administrative expenses and higher other operating expenses (excluding special charges). U.S. operating income in 2002 included lower combined operating margin dollars, lower selling, general & administrative expenses and lower other operating income (excluding special charges). Europes constant currency results in 2003 and 2002 benefited from strong performances in France and Russia. However, difficult economic conditions in Germany and weak results in the U.K. negatively impacted results in both years. Despite the difficult economic conditions, Germanys performance improved in the second half of 2003. APMEAs constant currency results in 2003 reflected strong results in Australia. However, weak results in most other markets, compounded by concerns about SARS in certain markets, negatively impacted the segment. In 2002, strong results in Australia were more than offset by weak results in Japan and Hong Kong. Latin Americas operating income in constant currencies significantly declined in both 2003 and 2002 due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by several key markets in the segment. In addition, Latin Americas results for both years were negatively impacted by higher provisions for uncollectible receivables. The Company is currently in litigation with about one third of the franchisees in Brazil, which is negatively impacting the Companys results in Latin America. We expect this to continue in the near term. 16 McDonalds Corporation OPERATING MARGINS Operating margin information and discussions relate to McDonalds restaurants only and exclude non McDonalds brands. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars represent sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars increased $182 million or 12% (5% in constant currencies) in 2003 and declined $12 million or 1% (3% in constant currencies) in 2002. The constant currency increase in 2003 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in the U.S. The constant currency decrease in 2002 was primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher labor rates, partly offset by restaurant expansion.

The U.S. Company operated margin percent increased in 2003 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower payroll as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and lower wage inflation. Higher commodity costs partly offset these trends. In 2002, the U.S. Company operated margin percent benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization and a lower advertising contribution rate, while weak comparable sales and higher labor costs negatively impacted the margin. In 2003, Europes Company operated margin percent reflected weak performance in the U.K. (which has the largest number of Company operated restaurants in Europe), partly offset by improved margin performance in Germany and France. In 2002, Europes Company operated margin percent reflected higher labor costs and an increase in occupancy & other operating expenses. Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented more than 65% of the combined operating margins in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Franchised margin dollars increased $341 million or 11% (5% in constant currencies) in 2003 and $36 million or 1% (flat in constant currencies) in 2002.

The decline in the consolidated franchised margin percent in 2002 reflected negative comparable sales, higher rent assistance to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and higher occupancy costs, due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 7% in 2003 and 3% in 2002 (3% and 4% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher performance based incentive compensation, as well as severance and other costs associated with the strategic decision to reduce restaurant openings. The constant currency increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending on technology in the Corporate segment, higher advertising expenses in the U.S. primarily related to the introduction of the Dollar Menu, and higher expenses for non McDonalds brands. McDonalds Corporation 17 Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined to 10.7% in 2003 compared with 11.1% in 2002 and 11.2% in 2001, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales declined to 4.0% in 2003 compared with 4.1% in 2002 and 2001. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants.

Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses). The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company expects lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2004 compared with 2003. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to strong results in the U.S. The decrease in 2002 was due to a net loss from our Japanese affiliate compared with earnings in 2001. Other expense Other expense in 2003 reflected higher losses on asset dispositions, higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in Latin America), and costs in the U.S. related to sites that will no longer be developed as a result of managements decision to significantly reduce capital expenditures. Other expense in 2002 reflected payments to U.S. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter service system and higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in Europe and Latin America), partly offset by a benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization. The Company expects lower other expense in 2004 compared with 2003. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased in 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels and interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2002 due to lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies. NONOPERATING EXPENSE, NET Nonoperating expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income, minority interests, and gains and losses related to other investments, financings and foreign currency translation. Nonoperating expense in 2003 reflected an $11 million loss on the early extinguishment of $200 million of debt as well as higher foreign currency translation losses compared with 2002. Nonoperating expense in 2002 reflected higher minority interest expense and foreign currency translation losses in 2002 compared with foreign currency translation gains 18 McDonalds Corporation in 2001. In addition, nonoperating expense in 2001 included $12 million primarily related to the write off of a corporate investment as well as minority interest expense related to the sale of real estate in Singapore. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The following table presents the reported effective income tax rates as well as the effective income tax rates before special items. 2003 2002 2001 Reported effective income tax rates 35.7 % 40.3 % 29.8 % Impact of special items(1) (2.2 ) (7.6 ) 1.3 Effective income tax rates before special items 33.5 % 32.7 % 31.1 % (1) Certain special items were not tax effected. The 2001 effective income tax rate reflected a benefit from the impact of tax law changes in certain international markets. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1,032 million in 2003 and $867 million in 2002. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. See summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending. Cash from operations totaled $3.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.0 billion in 2003, while cash from operations totaled $2.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $0.9 billion in 2002. Cash provided by operations, along with borrowings and other sources of cash, is used for capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations DOLLARS IN MILLIONS 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by operations $ 3,269 $ 2,890 $ 2,688 Cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures 250 % 144 % 141 % In addition to its cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Accordingly, the Company purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio, which was .76 at year end 2003. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES As a result of the Company strategically shifting its focus from adding new restaurants to building sales at existing restaurants, the Company significantly reduced capital expenditures and restaurant openings in 2003 compared with 2002 and 2001. In 2003, the Company opened 513 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 319 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 486 traditional restaurants and 184 satellite restaurants. In 2002, the Company opened 1,247 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 392 satellite restaurants, and closed 474 traditional restaurants and 158 satellite restaurants. About 65% of McDonalds restaurant additions occurred in the major markets in 2003.

In 2004, the Company expects to open about 550 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 300 satellite restaurants and close about 300 traditional restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants. Approximately 60% of Company operated restaurants and more than 85% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2003. Franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of McDonalds restaurants at year end 2003. Non McDonalds brand restaurants are primarily Company operated. Capital expenditures decreased $697 million or 35% in 2003 and increased $98 million or 5% in 2002. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to lower restaurant openings, consistent with our shift in strategic focus, partly offset by stronger foreign currencies (foreign currency translation increased capital expenditures by $73 million). The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending in the U.S. and Canada, partly offset by lower capital expenditures for new restaurants in Latin America. Capital expenditures for McDonalds restaurants McDonalds Corporation 19 in 2003, 2002 and 2001 reflected the leasing of a higher proportion of new sites and a program that gave U.S. franchisees the option to purchase new restaurant buildings. During 2003, the Company began to phase out the option for U.S. franchisees to purchase new restaurant buildings. Consequently, the Company is currently purchasing most buildings and, as a result, collects additional rent from the franchisees. Capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding Japan represented approximately 70% of the total in 2003 and 2002 and 60% in 2001. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. Capital expenditures IN MILLIONS 2003 2002 2001 New restaurants $ 617 $ 1,161 $ 1,198 Existing restaurants(1) 564 659 571 Other properties(2) 126 184 137 Total $ 1,307 $ 2,004 $ 1,906 Total assets $ 25,525 $ 23,971 $ 22,535 (1) Includes technology to improve service and food quality and enhancements to facilities to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. (2) Primarily computer equipment and furnishings for office buildings. Capital expenditures for new restaurants decreased $544 million or 47% in 2003 because the Company opened fewer restaurants and concentrated new restaurant investments in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. While capital expenditures for existing restaurants decreased in 2003, they increased as a percentage of total capital spending. This is due to the Companys focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as restaurant reimaging in several markets around the world, including the U.S. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment owned by the Company, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, standardization and global sourcing. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. In 2004, the Company is targeting eleven consolidated markets, including the U.S., for opening ten or more restaurants. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2003 total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants averaged approximately $1.8 million in the U.S. and approximately $1.7 million in the ten markets outside the U.S. The Company and its affiliates owned about 37% of the land and 60% of the buildings for its restaurants at year end 2003 and 2002. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS During 2003, the Company acquired 18.9 million shares of McDonalds stock for approximately $439 million under a $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized in 2001. Through 2003, 39.0 million shares for $975 million have been repurchased under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 28 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. In 2003, the Company declared a 70% increase in the annual dividend to $504 million, reflecting the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow, the positive results from its revitalization efforts and favorable changes in the U.S. tax law. As in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets grew by $1.6 billion or 6% in 2003 and $1.4 billion or 6% in 2002. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.9 billion in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. At year end 2003 and 2002, approximately 65% of consolidated assets was located in the major markets excluding Japan. Net property and equipment rose $1.3 billion in 2003 and represented 78% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2003 2002 2001 Return on average assets 11.4 % 9.2 % 12.3 % Return on average common equity 13.3 9.8 17.5 Special charges reduced return on average assets by 1.4% points in 2003, 3.6% points in 2002 and 1.8% points in 2001. In addition, these charges reduced return on average common equity by 2.8% points in 2003, 7.0% points in 2002 and 1.6% points in 2001. In 2003, return on average assets and return on average common equity both began to stabilize due to strong operating results in the U.S., partly offset by continued weak operating results in most markets in APMEA and Latin America. In 2002, return on average assets and return on average common equity both declined, primarily due to weak operating results in APMEA and Latin America. During 2004, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonalds restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. 20 McDonalds Corporation FINANCINGS AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2003 totaled $9.7 billion compared with $10.0 billion at December 31, 2002. The net decrease in 2003 was due to net payments ($892 million) and SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments ($44 million), partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($686 million). Debt highlights(1) 2003 2002 2001 Fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt(2,3) 62 % 62 % 45 % Weighted average annual interest rate of total debt 4.1 4.1 5.4 Foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt(2,3) 71 64 57 Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total shareholders equity)(2) 44 48 48 Cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt(2) 35 30 30 (1) All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted average annual interest rate, which is for the year.

Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch currently rate McDonalds commercial paper P 1, A 1 and F1; and its long term debt A2, A and A, respectively. Historically the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt using a multiple of eight times rent expense after considering certain adjustments to more accurately reflect its total aggregate lease commitments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 20% of Company operated restaurant leases outside the U.S., based on the Companys estimate); capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by approximately half of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. The Company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as $1.6 billion under a U.S. shelf registration and $607 million under a Euro Medium Term Notes program for future debt issuance. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Companys Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002 as follows: miscellaneous other assets$102 million and $134 million; other long term liabilities (excluding interest)$136 million and $39 million; and accrued payroll and other liabilities$29 million and $24 million. See summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No.133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.8 billion at year end 2003 and $6.2 billion at year end 2002. In addition, where practical, McDonalds restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2003, the Company was required to post collateral of $11.6 million, and at December 31, 2002, collateral of $2.2 million was posted by a counterparty. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2003 2002 Euro $ 1,922 $ 1,536 Canadian Dollars 1,086 808 Australian Dollars 781 620 British Pounds Sterling 741 700 Brazilian Reais 365 385 McDonalds Corporation 21 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2003 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2003 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2003. (See discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the December 31, 2003 consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $321 million of SFAS No.133 noncash fair value adjustments. The Company maintains a nonqualified, unfunded Supplemental Plan that allows participants to make tax deferred contributions and receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns in the Supplemental Plan are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities under the Supplemental Plan were $329 million at December 31, 2003 and $297 million at December 31, 2002, and were included in other long term liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. In addition to long term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $89 million at December 31, 2003. OTHER MATTERS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods. 22 McDonalds Corporation Long Lived Assets Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. (The biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales.) Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Restructuring and Litigation Accruals The Company has recorded charges related to restructuring markets, closing restaurants, eliminating positions and other strategic changes. The accruals recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs, number of restaurants to be closed and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities. Although the Company does not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates. From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers, competitors and intellectual property. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $4.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.
