Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company primarily franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. In addition, the Company operates certain non McDonalds brands that are not material to the Companys overall results. Of the more than 30,000 McDonalds restaurants in over 100 countries, over 8,000 are operated by the Company, more than 18,000 are operated by franchisees/licensees and over 4,000 are operated by affiliates. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&eacute;cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both Company operated and franchised restaurant sites. This ensures long term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for 100% of the business, including the real estate interest, while the Company generally has no capital invested. While we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor, we continually review our restaurant ownership mix (that is our mix between Company operated, conventional franchise, joint venture or developmental license) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability, with a focus on underperforming markets and markets where direct restaurant operation by us is unattractive due to market size, business conditions or legal considerations. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants along with our franchisees, we can develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. Our Company operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations, the financial health of franchisees or other factors. Revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20 year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments: United States; Europe; Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA); Latin America; and Canada. In addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled Other that includes non McDonalds brands (e.g., Boston Market and Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle)). The U.S. and Europe segments each account for approximately 35% of total revenues. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, collectively, account for over 60% of Europes revenues; Australia, China and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for nearly 50% of APMEAs revenues; and Brazil accounts for over 40% of Latin Americas revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating margins and returns. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the Company believes they better represent the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonalds restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction, reimaging or remodeling, and natural disasters. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales. The Company refers to this impact as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment. This impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales. Typically, the annual impact is minimal, with the exception of leap years. Systemwide sales include sales at all McDonalds and Other restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, McDonalds Corporation 13 management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because it is the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over a one year time period as well as longer time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by taking the constant foreign exchange rate change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) and dividing this by the constant foreign exchange rate adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator). The calculation assumes an average exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. Strategic direction and financial performance The Companys 50 years of success has been driven by the strength of McDonalds global brand and our unique business relationship among franchisees, suppliers and the Company (collectively referred to as the System). This business model is key to our success, fostering our ability to be locally relevant, a competitor in the marketplace and a contributor to our communities. This strategic alignment enables the System to pursue innovative ideas that satisfy our customers and profitably grow our business. In 2003, the Company initiated a comprehensive revitalization plan focused on maximizing customer satisfaction and strengthening our financial position. We redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants and aligned the System around our customer focused Plan to Win. A combination of customer centric initiatives designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing were implemented around five drivers of exceptional customer experiences people, products, place, price and promotion. In 2004, we substantially achieved our near term goals by executing our strategy. We improved the taste of many of our core menu offerings and introduced a variety of menu choices that were well received by customers such as new salad lines, breakfast and chicken offerings. We offered a variety of price points to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers. We streamlined processes such as new product development and restaurant operations, improved our training programs, and implemented performance measures, including a restaurant review and measurement process, to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to serve customers better. We also launched the im lovin it marketing theme, which achieved high levels of customer awareness worldwide. Throughout 2005, we remained aligned and focused on executing the Plan to Win, using our customer centric philosophy as our guide. Our 2005 performance reflected our continuously evolving customer relevance and powerful brand strength that culminated with December 2005 marking our 32nd consecutive month of positive global comparable sales. In the U.S., our strong sales momentum continued as increased customer demand for our core and premium products, breakfast menu and more convenient hours fueled growth on top of strong prior year comparisons. In Europe, we focused on gaining traction and building momentum across the entire segment. We had success in France and Russia and we gained traction in Germany where customers responded favorably to our Ein Mal Eins (one by one) value platform and premium products like Salads Plus. The U.K. remained a challenging marketplace and our efforts to gain traction in this market will take time. We are encouraged by our progress in Europe and confident that our focus on enhancing customers experience through menu, marketing and value initiatives will generate improvements over time. Over the past three years, in line with our commitment to revitalize the brand, we have exercised greater financial discipline. We delivered against the targets laid out in our revitalization plan and achieved many significant milestones. Today, our resulting financial strength and substantial cash generating ability is a testament to System alignment and focus on growing our existing restaurant business. Our progress has created the opportunity to return even greater amounts of cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases after funding investments in our business that offer solid returns. In 2005, we increased the dividend to $.67 per share, a 185% increase from the 2002 dividend and we repurchased over $2.2 billion of common stock since the beginning of 2003 to enhance shareholder value. Highlights from the year included: Comparable sales increased 3.9% building on a 6.9% increase in 2004. Systemwide sales increased 6%. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, Systemwide sales increased 5%. Consolidated revenues increased 7% to a record high of over $20 billion. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, revenues increased 6%. Net income per common share was $2.04 compared with $1.79 in 2004. Cash from operations increased $433 million to $4.3 billion. Capital expenditures were about $1.6 billion. The annual dividend was increased 22% per share, to $0.67 or $842 million. Share repurchases totaled about $1.2 billion. One year ROIIC was 46.0% and three year ROIIC was 36.6% for 2005. The decrease in Impairment and other charges (credits) included in operating income benefited these returns 20 percentage points and 18 percentage points, respectively. (See Other matters for details of the calculation.) 14 McDonalds Corporation On January 1, 2005, the Company early adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No.123(R)). This new accounting standard requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment prospectively. In connection with the adoption, the Company adjusted the mix of employee long term incentive based compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing certain cash based compensation (primarily annual incentive based compensation) and other equity based awards. Share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for years prior to the adoption. In 2005, share based and related compensation expense was $0.10 per share. The pro forma share based compensation for 2004 and 2003 was $0.11 per share and $0.17 per share, respectively. During 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $3 billion of foreign historical earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA). A majority of the repatriation was funded through local borrowings in certain markets, which totaled $2.9 billion. This resulted in an increase in cash and debt on our consolidated balance sheet at year end, which is expected to be temporary and does not signal any change in our financial and capital discipline. The repatriated cash will primarily be used to fund capital expenditures under our remodeling initiative, new restaurant openings and salaries in the U.S. Apart from HIA related activity, the Company paid down over $1.2 billion of debt during 2005. Outlook for 2006 The Companys long term goal is to create a differentiated customer experience one that builds brand loyalty and delivers long term, profitable growth for all shareholders and the System. Our long term goals remain unchanged: average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%, average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%, and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. These goals exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. Our guiding customer centric framework, the Plan to Win, remains solidly in place. We plan to create more relevant and deeper connections with our customers by capturing significant opportunities within the five fundamental drivers of our plan people, products, place, price and promotion. The initiatives around each P continuously evolve to maximize customer relevance and System profitability. We are confident that our Plan, supported by our unique system of franchisees and suppliers and our collective alignment will continue to drive long term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. In 2006, we remain committed to offering quality products that satisfy our customers demands for choice and variety, promoting the importance of physical activity and providing nutritional information on our food packaging. We will continue to introduce locally relevant new products that complement our core menu and provide customers with more reasons to visit, more often. In the U.S., we will extend the variety of our salad and chicken lines with the introduction of an Asian chicken salad, and we expect to strengthen our share of the growing chicken sandwich market with our premium Spicy Chicken Sandwich. In Europe, we are continuing our focus on our everyday value menus, such as Ein Mal Eins and Pound Saver along with premium offerings including salads and sandwiches such as the Big Tasty. In Asia, where rice is a daily staple, we successfully introduced an innovative rice burger in 2005 in Taiwan Kalubi beef or Spicy Chicken served on a lightly toasted rice patty and have plans to extend this concept to other Asian markets in 2006. Delivering value through a variety of menu price points that appeal to our broad range of customers has long been part of our history. A strong balance of core menu favorites, premium products and everyday value ensures that we can appeal to most people. In Europe and elsewhere, we continue to combine everyday value with a strong trade up strategy to remain relevant to todays customer and drive profitability. We also plan to capitalize on opportunities to improve the customer experience in our restaurants through improved service and ambiance. We continue to implement people training programs to enhance the overall service experience and we will extend our Restaurant Operation Improvement Process (ROIP) measurement of restaurant execution to even more markets this year. Our remodeling efforts will continue around the globe. In 2006, 2,500 restaurants worldwide are expected to be remodeled, utilizing innovative, modern designs. We will continue to enhance customer convenience by extending operating hours, accepting debit, credit and gift cards, enabling wireless internet access and adding double drive thru lanes in select restaurants. We believe providing information on nutrition and promoting physical activity support our customers needs to make the best choices for their lifestyles. Starting in 2006, we will provide nutrition information on the majority of our food packaging using an easy to understand icon and bar chart format. We plan to implement the new packaging in more than 20,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We are the first quick service restaurant to do this, guided by customer input and independent experts from around the world. In connection with executing the Plan to Win, to improve local relevance, profitability and returns, we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to identify potential operational and growth opportunities. The ownership mix in a given market depends on our plans for the market, local operating conditions, restaurant level results in the market and legal and regulatory constraints. In the United States, France, Germany and Australia, for example, we believe that our current ownership mix is appropriate in light of current operating results. By contrast, we plan to re franchise at least 50 Company operated restaurants in the U.K. in 2006 and McDonalds Corporation 15 we expect that the percentage of Company operated restaurants in that market will continue to decline from its current 63%. In Canada, we plan to review our Company operated restaurants and determine the most appropriate ownership mix and organize personnel around a revised structure for the business. In countries where franchising is not yet a well established business model, such as China or Russia, we will continue to own and operate our restaurants. We have also recently identified between 15 and 20 markets where we will pursue converting our existing ownership to a developmental licensee structure over the next three years. Under this structure, which the Company successfully employs in 32 countries outside the U.S. (approximately 800 restaurants), the licensees own the business, including the real estate interest, and use their local knowledge and their capital to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. Included in these 32 countries were two additional markets (325 restaurants) that became developmental licensees in 2005 and work on this change of ownership began a couple of years ago. While the Company generally has no capital invested in this type of market, it does receive a royalty based on a percent of sales. The royalty rate varies by market and is based on growth and profitability opportunity within the market. Our plans to change our ownership mix through conventional re franchising and increased use of developmental licenses will affect our results. The results of Company operated restaurants are recorded in our consolidated financial statements, and we are responsible for their ongoing capital investments, whereas restaurants operated under franchise or license agreements generate revenue streams without a comparable level of capital investment by us. We do not expect that the financial impact of our plans to adjust our ownership mix will be material in 2006 given the time required to execute these plans. Our plans to convert markets to a developmental license structure depend on our ability to identify prospective licensees with the experience and financial resources to be effective operators of McDonalds restaurants. We are in the process of identifying potential licensees in some of these markets, but we cannot predict how quickly we will complete transactions. The markets that we have targeted as candidates for developmental licenses had in the aggregate about 1,500 restaurants (predominately Company operated) and in 2005 had $1.5 billion in sales, $50 million in capital expenditures, $100 million in selling, general & administrative expenses and generated a modest operating loss. At December 31, 2005, the Companys net investment in these markets was about $1.6 billion. As a result of our annual testing, we recorded impairment charges for some of these markets in the last three years. For others, current cash flows or undiscounted projected cash flows are such that no impairment charges were required. In each case, our impairment testing was based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure. We will continue our annual impairment testing for these assets based on this assumption until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within 12 months, and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds. We may not recover our entire net investment in each of these markets and may therefore record losses in future periods as we adjust our ownership mix. The timing and amount of any losses will depend on the circumstances of each transaction. Currently, we do not believe that any significant transactions are likely to be completed within 12 months. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results. Changes in constant currency Systemwide sales are driven by changes in comparable sales and restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add about 1 percentage point to sales growth in 2006 (in constant currencies). Most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in 2005. The Company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would increase annual earnings per share by about 2 cents. Similarly, an increase of 1 percentage point in Europes comparable sales would increase annual earnings per share by about 1.5 cents. The Company expects full year 2006 selling, general & administrative expenses to increase at a rate less than Systemwide sales, in constant currencies, and to decline as a percent of revenues, compared with 2005 without considering any impact of changes in ownership mix. A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 80% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction compared with 2005, the Companys annual earnings per share would change about 6 cents to 7 cents. Based on current rates, foreign currency translation is expected to negatively affect earnings in the first quarter 2006. The Company plans to return to pre HIA debt and cash levels as we pay down debt over the next couple of years. The late 2005 borrowings, used to fund dividend payments to repatriate earnings back to the U.S. parent company, resulted in a temporary increase in both cash and debt on our year end consolidated balance sheet. However, our net debt position (gross debt outstanding less cash available for investment) has improved significantly, excluding this one time opportunity. The Company expects interest expense in 2006 to increase 7% to 9% compared with 2005, based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We expect this increase will be partly offset by the related higher interest income from cash available for investing, resulting in a 4% to 6% increase in interest expense, net of interest income. 16 McDonalds Corporation The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2006 to be approximately 31% to 33%, although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2006 to be approximately $1.8 billion. In 2006 and 2007 combined, the Company expects to return between $5 billion and $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends. The Company expects to complete share repurchases of about $1 billion in the first quarter of 2006. In January 2006, Chipotle completed an initial public offering of 6.1 million shares resulting in proceeds of approximately $120 million to Chipotle. McDonalds sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares resulting in proceeds to the Company of $61 million, while still remaining the majority shareholder. As a result of the offering, the Company will record a pretax nonoperating gain of about $50 million in the first quarter of 2006. During the first quarter 2006, the Company has taken certain actions to improve profitability in two challenging markets. In Brazil, we reached an agreement to acquire restaurants operated by several litigating franchisees and expect to incur pretax charges of approximately $20 million. In the U.K., as part of a strategic review of its high street locations, the Company has developed a plan that focuses on improving profits of those sites. In connection with that plan, we expect to close 25 restaurants in the U.K. in the first quarter 2006, resulting in lease cancellation and other charges of approximately $40 million pretax.

McDonalds Corporation 17 Net income and diluted net income per common share In 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2,602 million and $2.04, respectively. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No.123(R) and the related compensation remix, 2005 net income included $130 million or $0.10 per share of share based and related compensation expense. The 2005 results also included a net tax benefit of $73 million or $0.05 per share comprised of $179 million or $0.14 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. tax returns and $106 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate foreign earnings under HIA. In addition, 2005 included impairment and other charges and credits that netted to $28 million of pretax income ($12 million income after tax or $0.01 of income per share). In 2004, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2,279 million and $1.79, respectively (or $1.68 per share including pro forma share based compensation expense of $0.11 per share). The 2004 results included pretax operating charges of $160 million ($105 million after tax or $0.08 per share) related to a lease accounting correction and $130 million ($116 million after tax or $0.09 per share) related to asset and goodwill impairment charges, primarily in South Korea. In 2004, results also included pretax nonoperating income of $49 million ($49 million after tax or $0.04 per share) relating to the sale of the Companys interest in a U.S. real estate partnership that resulted in the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. In 2003, net income and diluted net income per common share after cumulative effect of accounting change were $1,471 million and $1.15, respectively (or $0.98 per share including pro forma share based compensation expense of $0.17 per share). The 2003 results included net pretax charges of $408 million ($323 million after tax or $0.25 per share) primarily related to the disposition of certain non McDonalds brands and asset and goodwill impairment, primarily in Latin America. Refer to the Impairment and other charges (credits), net section as well as the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. For 2005, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to 2004. Shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than the prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004. Treasury stock purchased in 2005 offset this higher balance as well as the impact of options exercised during the year. In 2004, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased compared to 2003. Shares outstanding at the beginning of the year were lower than the prior year due to treasury stock purchased exceeding stock options exercised in 2003, partly offset by a higher dilutive effect of stock options outstanding. Impact of foreign currencies on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2005, revenues were positively impacted by the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation. The Euro had a minimal impact on reported results. In 2004 and 2003, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and net income due to the strengthening of several major currencies, primarily the Euro.

In the U.S., the increase in revenues in 2005 was driven by multiple initiatives that are delivering variety like our new Premium Chicken Sandwiches, convenience such as cashless payment options and extended hours as well as our continued focus on value. In 2004, the increase in revenues was due to the combined strength of the strategic menu, marketing and service initiatives. Franchised and affiliated revenues increased at a higher rate than Company operated sales in 2004 due to a higher percentage of franchised restaurants throughout the year compared with 2003. Europes increase in revenues for 2005 was due to strong comparable sales in Russia, which is entirely Company operated, and positive comparable sales in France and Germany, partly offset by negative comparable sales in the U.K. In 2004, the increase in Europes revenues was due to strong comparable sales in Russia and positive comparable sales in France, the U.K. and many other markets, partly offset by poor performance in Germany. In APMEA, revenues for 2005 benefited from strong comparable sales in Australia and Taiwan, and were negatively impacted by the conversion of two markets (about 325 restaurants) to developmental licensee structures during 2005. In addition, revenues benefited from expansion in China, partly offset by that markets negative comparable sales. In 2004, the increase in APMEAs revenues was due primarily to strong performance in China and Australia as well as positive comparable sales in many other markets, partly offset by poor performance in South Korea. In Latin America, revenues in 2005 and 2004 increased in constant currencies primarily due to positive comparable sales in many markets and a higher percentage of Company operated restaurants compared with prior years.

Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented more than 65% of the combined operating margins in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Franchised margin dollars increased $246 million or 6% (6% in constant currencies) in 2005 and $427 million or 13% (8% in constant currencies) in 2004. The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for more than 85% of the franchised margin dollars in all three years.

In 2004, the Company operated margin percent increased primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity costs and higher staffing levels. Commodity cost pressures are expected to ease in 2006. In Europe, the Company operated margin percent in 2005 decreased due to the U.K., primarily as a result of higher labor costs and negative comparable sales, partly offset by strong performance in Russia. In addition, higher beef costs had a negative impact across the segment for the year. In 2004, Russias strong performance also benefited the Company operated margin percent but was more than offset by weak performance in Germany and the U.K. as well as higher commodity costs across the segment. Commodities are expected to have a slightly negative impact in the first quarter of 2006 and remain relatively flat for the year. In APMEA, the Company operated margin percent in both 2005 and 2004 was negatively impacted by weak results in South Korea, partly offset by improvements in Hong Kong. In addition, 2004 benefited from improved performance in Australia and China. In Latin America, the Company operated margin percent in both years reflected improved performance, driven by strong comparable sales in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. 20 McDonalds Corporation Supplemental information regarding Company operated McDonalds restaurants As noted earlier, we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants, we can develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. Like other restaurant companies, we report results for Company operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs, and we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and, to a lesser extent, write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe that the following supplemental information regarding our Company operated restaurants in our most mature and significant markets will assist investors in understanding the performance of this business as if it were operated as franchised restaurants. While this analysis would shift certain revenues and costs between Company operated and franchised margins, consolidated operating margins would not change. In our Company operated margins, our occupancy expense (outside rent expense and depreciation for buildings & leasehold improvements) would be replaced by rents and service fees comparable to those paid by franchisees. Since selling, general & administrative expenses are not specifically allocated to the Company operated restaurant business, an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the U.S., Canada and our three major markets in Europe. We believe, on average, a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant is typical, but will vary depending on local circumstances and the structure of the market. These costs reflect the support services we believe are necessary to provide the best customer experience. Other selling, general & administrative costs to support the brand would be covered by a service fee charged to this business.

McDonalds Corporation 21 Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 12% in 2005 and 8% in 2004 (11% and 5% in constant currencies). The share based and related incremental compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No.123(R) accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in 2005. The constant currency increase in 2004 reflected higher performance based incentive compensation. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 10.9% in 2005 compared with 10.4% in 2004 and 10.7% in 2003, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 4.1% in 2005 compared with 3.9% in 2004 and 4.0% in 2003. The share based and related incremental compensation expense increased these ratios 0.9 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, in 2005. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants.

(2) Certain items were not tax effected. Restaurant closings/impairment In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $23 million and $130 million of pretax charges for impairment, respectively, primarily due to South Korea and its continued poor results. In 2003, the Company recorded $136 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $148 million primarily related to impairment in Latin America; $30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in Latin America; and a $42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings, primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated. Restructuring In 2005, the Company recorded $51 million of pretax income, primarily due to favorable adjustments related to the conversion of a market to a developmental licensee in APMEA and certain liabilities established in 2001 and 2002 due to lower than originally anticipated employee related and lease termination costs. In 2003, the Company recorded $272 million of pretax charges consisting of: $237 million related to the loss on the sale of Donatos Pizzeria, the closing of all Donatos and Boston Market restaurants outside the U.S. and the exit of a domestic joint venture with Fazolis; and $35 million related to revitalization plan actions of McDonalds Japan. Lease accounting correction During 2004, like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries, the Company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions. Following this review and in consultation with its external auditors, the Company corrected an error in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property. The result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed rent escalations by revising the computation of straight line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods. As the correction related solely to accounting treatment, it did not affect McDonalds historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases. Its effect on the Companys earning per share, cash from operations and shareholders equity was immaterial. These adjustments primarily impacted the U.S., China, Boston Market and Chipotle. Other markets were less significantly impacted, as many of the leases outside of the U.S. do not contain fixed rent escalations.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. Results in 2005 decreased primarily due to results at our Japanese affiliate, which included a one time adjustment for restaurant employees back pay. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to stronger performance in the U.S. and improved results from our Japanese affiliate. Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense for 2005 reflected lower losses on asset dispositions and lower costs to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in Brazil. Asset dispositions and other expense in 2004 reflected higher losses on asset dispositions compared with 2003, certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants operated by litigating franchisees in Brazil and provisions for certain contingencies.

(2) Calculated by subtracting pro forma share based expense from reported operating income. The following discussion on Operating income relates to pro forma increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation in the table above. In 2005 and 2004, U.S. operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars compared to 2004 and 2003, respectively. Selling, general & administrative expense in 2005 was higher partly due to certain information technology expenses previously recorded in the Corporate segment. Other operating expense decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to higher asset dispositions in 2004. In 2004, operating income included charges related to the lease accounting correction of $70 million as well as impairment charges of $10 million. In Europe, results for 2005 reflected strong performance in France and Russia, improved performance in Germany and weak results in the U.K. In addition, results included a supply chain charge of $24 million, which negatively impacted the operating income growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points. In 2004, results benefited from strong performances in France and Russia as well as improved performance in Italy, offset by weak results in the U.K. and Germany. In addition, 2004 results included impairment charges of $25 million. In APMEA, results for 2005 were positively impacted by strong performance in Australia partly offset by weak results in Japan, China and South Korea. In 2004, operating income also benefited from Australias performance as well as improved performance in Hong Kong and China, partly offset by poor results in South Korea. Results for 2004 also included charges related to the lease accounting correction of $46 million as well as impairment charges of $93 million. In Latin America, results for 2005 improved due to continued strong sales performance in most markets as well as lower costs to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in Brazil when compared to 2004. In 2004, Latin Americas operating loss decreased as compared with 2003, due to impairment charges in 2003 as well as significantly lower provisions for uncollectible receivables and improved performance in Venezuela and Argentina. In addition, operating income in 2004 included certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in Brazil. In the Corporate segment, results for 2005 benefited from lower share based compensation, certain information technology expenses that are now reflected in the U.S. segment, lower incentive based compensation and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in 2001 and 2002 due to lower than originally anticipated employee related and lease termination costs. Interest expense Interest expense for 2005 reflected higher average interest rates and lower average debt levels. HIA debt borrowed late in the fourth quarter had a minimal impact on the average debt levels for 2005. Interest expense decreased in 2004 due to lower average debt levels and interest rates, partly offset by stronger foreign currencies.

McDonalds Corporation 25 Provision for income taxes In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.7%, 28.9% and 35.7%, respectively. In 2005, the effective tax rate included a benefit of $179 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by additional expense of approximately $106 million related to the Companys decision to take advantage of the one time opportunity provided under HIA to repatriate certain foreign earnings. The net of both items benefited the 2005 effective tax rate by about 2 percentage points. The effective income tax rate for the full year 2004 benefited from an international transaction and the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. In 2003, the effective income tax rate included a benefit of $102 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Companys 19971999 U.S. tax returns, as well as certain asset impairment and other charges that were not tax affected. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1,111 million in 2005 and $1,319 million in 2004. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Accounting changes SFAS Statement No.123(R) Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost in 2005 includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all share based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and (2) all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Refer to the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this item. In 2005, in connection with its adoption of SFAS No.123(R), the Company adjusted the mix of employee long term incentive compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing cash based incentives and other equity based awards. For the year ended 2005, results included pretax expense of $191 million (or $0.10 per share after tax) of which $154 million related to share based compensation and $37 million related to the compensation shift. Cumulative effect of accounting change Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. The ongoing annual impact of this statement is not material to the Company. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchase. Cash from operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.7 billion in 2005, while cash from operations totaled $3.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.5 billion in 2004. Cash provided by operations increased $433 million in 2005 and $635 million in 2004 due to strong operating results, primarily in the U.S., and changes in working capital. The changes in working capital in 2005 benefited from lower income tax payments compared with the prior year. The Company expects to have higher income tax payments in 2006. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.8 billion in 2005, an increase of $435 million primarily due to higher capital expenditures and increased purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2004, flat compared with 2003, due to higher capital expenditures and lower sales of property, offset by lower purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash from financing activities totaled $362 million in 2005, an increase of $2.0 billion primarily due to $2.9 billion of local borrowings related to HIA and higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The increase was partly offset by higher share repurchases, higher debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend. In 2004, cash used for financing activities totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $103 million primarily due to higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises and lower debt repayments, partly offset by higher share repurchases and an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance increased $2.9 billion in 2005 to $4.3 billion, compared to an increase of $887 million in 2004. The Company plans to return to pre HIA cash levels over the next couple of years as we use this cash to fund capital expenditures under our remodeling initiatives, new restaurants openings and salaries in the U.S. In addition to cash and equivalents and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2005, the Company opened 558 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 120 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 145 traditional restaurants and 263 satellite restaurants. In 2004, the Company opened 430 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 198 satellite restaurants, and closed 185 traditional restaurants and 134 satellite restaurants. About 85% and 70% of McDonalds net restaurant additions occurred in the major markets in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 26 McDonalds Corporation Systemwide restaurants at year end(1) 2005 2004 2003 U.S. 13,727 13,673 13,609 Europe 6,352 6,287 6,186 APMEA 7,692 7,567 7,475 Latin America 1,617 1,607 1,578 Canada 1,378 1,362 1,339 Other 1,120 1,065 942 Total 31,886 31,561 31,129 (1) Includes satellite units at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 as follows: U.S.1,268, 1,341, 1,307; Europe190, 181, 150; APMEA (primarily Japan)1,730, 1,819, 1,841; Latin America8,13, 20; and Canada395, 378, 350. In 2006, the Company expects to open about 700 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants and close about 225 traditional restaurants and 125 satellite restaurants. Approximately 65% of Company operated restaurants and more than 85% of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2005. Franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of McDonalds restaurants at year end 2005. Non McDonalds brand restaurants are primarily Company operated. Capital expenditures increased $188 million or 13% in 2005 and $112 million or 9% in 2004. The increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. The increase in capital expenditures in 2004 was also due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, partly offset by lower expenditures on restaurant openings. Capital expenditures in both years reflects the Companys focus on growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in both 2005 and 2004 were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and or opportunities for long term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2005 total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants averaged approximately $1.9 million in the U.S. and approximately $1.7 million in the 9 markets where development was concentrated outside the U.S. For 2006, the U.S., China and eight other consolidated markets are expected to account for about 75% of restaurant openings. The Company and its affiliates owned 37% of the land and 59% of the buildings for its restaurants at year end 2005 and 2004. Share repurchases and dividends For the past three years, the Company has returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders through shares repurchased and dividends. In 2006 and 2007 combined, the Company expects to return between $5 billion and $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends. The Company expects to complete share repurchases of about $1 billion in the first quarter of 2006. Shares repurchased and dividends IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2005 2004 2003 Number of shares repurchased 39.5 22.2 18.9 Dividends declared per share $ .67 $ .55 $ .40 Dollar amount of shares repurchased $ 1,228 $ 605 $ 439 Dividends $ 842 $ 695 $ 504 Total cash returned to shareholders $ 2,070 $ 1,300 $ 943 The Company repurchases shares of its common stock under a $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized in 2001. Through 2005, 100.7 million shares have been repurchased for $2.8 billion under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 30 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. In 2005, the Company declared a 22% per share increase in the annual dividend to $0.67 per share or $842 million, reflecting the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. This represents a 185% increase from the 2002 dividend. As in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing dividend yields, profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. McDonalds Corporation 27 FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets grew by $2.2 billion or 8% in 2005 and $2.0 billion or 8% in 2004. Total assets in 2005 included $2.9 billion of cash borrowed under HIA, partly offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased total assets by approximately $1.3 billion in 2005. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by $1.0 billion in 2004. Nearly 65% of consolidated assets were located in the major markets at year end 2005. Net property and equipment decreased $795 million in 2005 and represented 66% of total assets at year end. Operating income, which excludes interest income, is used to compute return on average assets, while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2005 2004 2003 Return on average assets(1) 14.4 % 13.4 % 11.4 % Return on average common equity 17.8 17.8 13.3 (1) Return on average assets was negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the Companys planning related to HIA and subsequent repatriation of earnings in 2005. Cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 1.2 percentage points, 0.6 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Impairment and other charges reduced return on average assets by 0.9 percentage points in 2004 and 1.4 percentage points in 2003. In addition, these charges reduced return on average common equity by 1.3 percentage points in 2004 and 2.8 percentage points in 2003. In 2005 and 2004, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S. In addition, returns in 2004 benefited from improved results in Europe. In 2005, return on average common equity reflected the same percentage increase in both net income and average shareholders equity (driven by the significant increase in shareholders equity at the end of 2004 compared with 2003). During 2006, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonalds restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth, such as China. In addition, the Company expects to return between $5 billion and $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends in 2006 and 2007 combined. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2005 totaled $10.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The net increase in 2005 was due to net issuances related to HIA ($2.9 billion), partly offset by net payments ($1.2 billion), the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($580 million) and the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) noncash fair value adjustments ($112 million).

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. (4) HIA related borrowings caused an 18 percentage point decrease in fixed rate debt in 2005. (5) HIA related borrowings caused an 8 percentage point increase in foreign currency denominated debt in 2005. Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch currently rate the Companys commercial paper P 1, A 1 and F1, respectively; and its long term debt A2, A and A, respectively. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, which includes debt outstanding on the Companys balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $7 billion and $10 billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 25% of Company operated restaurant leases outside the U.S., based on the Companys estimate); capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating 28 McDonalds Corporation on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. The Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as approximately $1.4 billion under a U.S. shelf registration and $416 million under a Euro Medium Term Notes program for future debt issuance. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and 2004 primarily in miscellaneous other assets ($83 million and $102 million, respectively) and other long term liabilities ($103 million and $218 million, respectively). See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No.133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2005, the Company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to HIA. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $8.1 billion and $6.6 billion for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was required to post collateral of $24 million and $46 million, respectively. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2005 2004 Euro $ 2,073 $ 2,453 Canadian Dollars 1,070 964 British Pounds Sterling 822 1,086 Australian Dollars 682 880 Brazilian Reais 395 372 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2005 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2005 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2005. (See discussions of Cash flows and Financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $191 million of SFAS No.133 noncash fair value adjustments. This effect is excluded as these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the Companys qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $366 million at December 31, 2005 and $350 million at December 31, 2004 and were included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to long term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $46 million at December 31, 2005. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgements based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and or complexity. Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods. Share based compensation The Company has share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Long lived assets impairment review Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. The biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. 30 McDonalds Corporation Losses on assets held for sale are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets, the assets are available for sale and probable of occurring within 12 months and the net sales proceeds from the assets are expected to be less than its net book value. Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2005, the Company recorded a $179 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the Companys 20002002 U.S. tax returns. During 2003, the Company recorded a $102 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the Companys 1997 1999 tax returns. The Companys 2003 2004 U.S. tax returns are under audit. The audit is expected to be completed in late 2006 or early 2007 and no estimate can be made of the benefit or charge, if any, resulting from the completion of the audit. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $3.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in the businesses. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing pricesinflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management to determine the effectiveness of capital deployed. ROIIC is calculated as a percentage and is calculated on a one year basis and a three year basis. The numerator is the Companys constant foreign exchange rate (excludes the impact of foreign currency translation) incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, based on a comparison of the current and base periods. The denominator is the constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less net cash (collections) and issuances of notes receivable, which do not generate operating income. Constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis detailed in the tables below. These weightings reflect the relative contribution of each quarters investing activities to constant foreign exchange rate incremental operating income. Once the weightings are applied to the adjusted cash used for investing activities in each quarter, the results are aggregated to arrive at the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. McDonalds Corporation 31 The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year ROIIC are as follows: One year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Pro forma operating income(1) $ 4,021.6 $ 3,299.3 $ 722.3 Depreciation and amortization 1,249.5 1,201.0 48.5 Currency translation(2) (26.6 ) Constant foreign exchange rate incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization $ 744.2 DENOMINATOR: Weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $ 1,625.4 Currency translation(2) (6.0 ) Constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities $ 1,619.4 One year ROIIC(4) 46.0 % (1) Reflects adjustments for comparability purposes with respect to share based expense as described in discussion of Operating income.
