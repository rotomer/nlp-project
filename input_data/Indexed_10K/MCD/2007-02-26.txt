ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company primarily franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. In addition, the Company operates and has investments in certain non McDonalds brands that are not material to the Companys overall results. Of the 31,046 McDonalds restaurants in 118 countries at year end 2006, 18,685 are operated by franchisees (including 1,091 operated by developmental licensees), 4,195 are operated by affiliates and 8,166 are operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&eacute;cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both Company operated and franchised restaurant sites. This ensures long term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide ongoing capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, while the Company generally has no capital invested. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix (that is our mix among Company operated, franchised conventional or developmental license, and joint venture) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve both goals. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants, and in collaboration with our franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. Our Company operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations. Revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20 year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments: United States; Europe; Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA); Latin America; and Canada. In addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled Corporate & Other that includes Corporate activities and non McDonalds brands (e.g., Boston Market). The U.S. and Europe segments each account for approximately 35% of total revenues. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 60% of Europes revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for nearly 50% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. During 2006, the Company disposed of its entire investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock. As a result of the complete disposition of Chipotle, the Company has reflected Chipotles results for all years shown as discontinued operations, including gains from the disposition in 2006. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating margins and returns. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because we believe they better represent the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonalds restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction, reimaging or remodeling, and natural disasters. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales. The Company refers to this impact as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment. This impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales. Typically, the annual impact is minimal, with the exception of leap years. Systemwide sales include sales at all McDonalds and Boston Market restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because it is the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. 11 Table of Contents Strategic direction and financial performance The unique business relationship among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success over the years. This business model enables McDonalds to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers. In addition, our strategic alignment facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business. The Company is focused on increasing McDonalds relevance to consumers through the execution of multiple initiatives under our Plan to Win in order to be better, not just bigger. This plan is designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing leveraged around five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences people, products, place, price and promotion. Our long term financial targets include average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. These targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. Since implementing our Plan to Win, we improved the taste of many of our menu items and have introduced a variety of new menu choices such as premium salads, premium burgers and additional chicken offerings in many markets worldwide. We appeal to a broad range of customer preferences using a locally relevant three tier menu strategy featuring premium salad and sandwich selections, classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings. We strive for continuous improvement in our training programs and restaurant execution through a comprehensive restaurant operations improvement process to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to improve the customer experience. In addition, our im lovin it global marketing theme continues to evolve to extend our marketing reach to consumers via print, billboards and digital communications in addition to television advertising. These efforts have increased our consumer relevance and delivered strong results in each of the last three years with revenue growth, operating income growth and returns on incremental invested capital meeting or exceeding our long term financial targets. In addition, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends paid and shares acquired from 2004 through 2006. In 2006, the Companys increased relevance contributed to more customers visiting our restaurants, helping drive global comparable sales up 5.7% and extending our consecutive monthly increases to 44 months through December 2006. The momentum of our U.S. business continued as a result of further strengthening our robust breakfast business and expanding our beverage, salad and chicken offerings, including the successful introductions of Premium Roast Coffee, the Asian Salad and the Snack Wrap. Initiatives such as reimaging restaurants, extending operating hours and providing cashless payment options helped make McDonalds more inviting and convenient for customers. In Europe, we built momentum using locally relevant menu offerings such as premium burgers and classic menu favorites, as well as value platforms such as Ein Mal Eins in Germany and Pound Saver in the U.K. The markets provided predictable menu choice and variety through popular food promotions, and engaged consumers with innovative marketing. Europes results were driven by strong performance in France, Germany and most other markets as well as significantly improved performance in the U.K. We also made progress improving consumer perceptions in Europe, including the U.K., by aggressively communicating McDonalds food quality, nutrition and employment facts. In addition, to enhance local relevance by having local franchisees operate more restaurants and to improve returns, we reduced our percentage of Company operated restaurants in the U.K. from 63% at the end of 2005 to 54% at the end of 2006. We are encouraged by our momentum in Europe and confident that our combined initiatives designed to enhance the customers experience will continue to drive growth over the long term. In APMEA, Systemwide sales and revenue growth were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Japan and Australia and new restaurant expansion and positive comparable sales in China. Strategic menu pricing in Japan and China contributed to this segments performance. In 2006, we also entered into a strategic alliance with Sinopec, Chinas largest petroleum retailer. This agreement provides us the opportunity to co develop drive thru restaurants at existing and new Sinopec locations, positioning us to capitalize on changing consumer lifestyles in China. We believe that the long term growth potential for our business in China is substantial and we are well positioned to capture the opportunity. We continue to focus our management and financial resources on the core McDonalds business as the opportunities for growth remain significant. Accordingly, during 2006, we disposed of our entire investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings and an October tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock. These transactions provided the Company with $329 million in cash proceeds and facilitated the acquisition of 18.6 million shares of McDonalds stock via the exchange. In 2006, our strong global performance generated $4.3 billion of cash provided by operations. About $1.7 billion of this cash was reinvested in our business primarily to remodel existing restaurants and build new ones. We increased our annual dividend nearly 50% to $1 per share. We also acquired 98.4 million shares through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange. In addition, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt in 2006 reducing the 2005 increase related to the Homeland Investment Act. To improve local relevance, profitability and returns, we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets. The ownership mix in a given market depends on current and potential results, the risks associated with operating in certain countries, and legal and regulatory constraints. As part of this evaluation, in 2006, we established a target of having less than 30% Company operated restaurants in each of our major consolidated markets and began working toward this goal, specifically in the U.K. and Canada. For certain markets like China, we believe owning and operating the restaurants is prudent until the legal environment in these countries becomes more conducive to franchising. In addition to our franchising efforts discussed above, we have identified markets with about 2,300 restaurants collectively, primarily Company operated restaurants in Latin America and APMEA, that we intend to transition to a developmental license structure. Under a developmental license, a local entrepreneur owns the business, including controlling the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the Brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. Under this arrangement, the Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital. During 2006, this royalty averaged about five percent of sales. We have successfully used this structure for more than 15 years, and currently have 36 countries that are solely operated by developmental licensees. In addition to the financial benefits the Company achieves when markets are developmentally licensed 12 Table of Contents such as reduced capital spending, improved returns and a stable stream of royalties, this strategy allows the local owner to improve relevance and accelerate growth in the market, and allows management to focus most of their time and energy on the markets that have the largest impact on results. Highlights from the year included: Comparable sales increased 5.7% building on a 3.9% increase in 2005. Systemwide sales increased 7% both as reported and in constant currencies. Consolidated revenues increased 9% (7% in constant currencies). Income from continuing operations per common share was $2.30 compared with $2.03 in 2005, an increase of 13%. Cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion. The Company increased the annual dividend nearly 50% to $1.00 per share, or $1.2 billion in total. The Company also acquired 98.4 million shares for $3.7 billion, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding at year end compared with 2005. One year ROIIC was 24.9% and three year ROIIC was 41.3% for 2006. Outlook for 2007 The McDonalds System is energized by our current momentum. We intend to build on this momentum by further enhancing every element of the Brand experience and strengthening our connection with customers to capture the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We will do this by continuing to execute our Plan to Win with a strategic focus on our customers and restaurants, while continuing to exercise disciplined financial management. We are confident that our Plan to be better, not just bigger, supported by the alignment of our unique system of franchisees and suppliers, will continue to drive enduring profitable growth. Our financial targets, previously discussed, focus management on those opportunities that best optimize shareholder value over the long term. In 2007, we will continue to leverage our three tier menu approach featuring premium selections, core menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings to appeal to a broad range of consumers. We will complement this three tier strategy with permanent and limited time offerings of new products that enhance menu choice, variety and value. In the U.S., our strategies focus on chicken, breakfast, beverages and convenience. We are introducing Snack Wrap variations and the new Southwest Salad as well as additional breakfast offerings. We will also enhance the drive thru experience by continuing to optimize the layout of restaurant interiors and exteriors. In Europe, we will continue to attract customers with a variety of new food offerings, such as Premium Chicken Sandwiches and Snack Wraps, while leveraging the strength of our everyday affordability platforms. Building greater brand trust will remain a priority in Europe with ongoing aggressive communication efforts surrounding our food quality, nutrition and employment image. In addition, we will focus on remodeling restaurants and improving operations to enhance local relevance and upgrade the customer experience. In APMEA, where a large percentage of the population already eats breakfast away from home, we are introducing or expanding breakfast as well as extending restaurant operating hours. We will also continue to reinforce everyday value offerings and work on optimizing our menu pricing structure to enhance profitability. We will continue to support consumers desire to make balanced lifestyle choices by educating them about our foods nutritional value and encouraging greater physical activity. We added nutrition labeling to the packaging of many of our branded core menu items in more than 25,000 restaurants worldwide by the end of 2006. We will extend this effort to cover even more restaurants and products in 2007. We will also continue to play a leadership role in addressing childrens well being as we pursue initiatives designed to positively affect childrens choice and activity. This includes committing a large portion of our childrens marketing budget toward communications that encourage kids to be more active physically and mentally. We will also work to further enhance the customer experience by refining and executing our restaurant operations improvement process and expanding the use of our new point of sale software (POS), which was in approximately 8,400 restaurants as of year end 2006. Tests indicate this new POS helps improve order accuracy and drive thru service speed. In addition, we will continue developing a new flexible operating system that takes a modular plug and play approach to kitchen configuration and restaurant operations. In the future, this system will enable greater menu flexibility based on local market needs while making it easier for crew to satisfy customers. Due to our expectations for continued strong results, relatively stable capital expenditures over the next few years, and the Companys intent on maintaining current debt to capital levels of 35% to 40%, we believe that cash available for dividends and share repurchases will continue to grow. We expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in share count in the years ahead given our reduction in equity compensation and fewer stock options outstanding, compared to prior years. In 2007, we will continue to reduce the percentage of Company operated restaurants in the U.K. and Canada, and we will continue to pursue the developmental license strategy described earlier. The previously mentioned 2,300 restaurants identified for potential conversion to developmental licensees represented nearly $3 billion in sales in 2006, but only generated $30 million in operating income after impairment and other charges. To achieve these results, we spent about $180 million in selling, general & administrative expenses and invested more than $100 million in capital expenditures. As appropriate, we may license some of these markets as a group to a single developmental licensee. These 2,300 restaurants are about 75% Company operated and represent about $3 billion in combined net investment, which includes approximately $800 million in accumulated currency translation losses reflected in shareholders equity on our balance sheet. Our intent is to complete these transactions by the end of 2008. If we are able to complete these transactions, we do not anticipate recovering either the $800 million in historical currency translation losses or most of the remaining $2.2 billion in net book value in the form of sales proceeds, and therefore, we expect that the loss, in the aggregate, would be significant. We will continue impairment testing for these assets annually and as otherwise required by applicable accounting standards. In particular, our annual impairment testing for these assets is based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within 12 months, and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds. The timing and amount of any loss for a particular transaction will depend on individual circumstances. In 2006, we completed the transfer of 121 restaurants in four markets to developmental licensees and recorded pretax losses totaling $36 million related to this strategy. 13 Table of Contents While the Company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than 1 percentage point to 2007 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 359 net traditional McDonalds restaurants added during 2006. In 2007, the Company expects to open about 800 McDonalds restaurants (700 traditional and 100 satellites). We expect net additions of about 400 (450 net traditional additions and 50 net satellite closings). The Company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2.5 cents. Similarly, an increase of 1 percentage point in Europes comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2 cents. The primary food commodities impacting McDonalds business are beef and chicken. In 2007, U.S. beef costs are expected to be down slightly, while we expect U.S. chicken costs to rise. In Europe, both beef and chicken costs are expected to increase slightly in 2007. The Company expects full year 2007 selling, general & administrative expenses to decline modestly as a percent of revenues and Systemwide sales compared with 2006. A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 80% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction compared with 2006, the Companys annual net income per share would change by about 7 cents to 8 cents. In 2007, based on current business performance and plans, the Company expects to maintain a debt to capital ratio of 35% to 40%. Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2007 to remain relatively flat compared with 2006, while it expects interest income to decrease about 40% to 50% due to lower cash balances. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2007 to be approximately 31% to 33%, although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2007 to be approximately $1.9 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to build new restaurants. In 2006, the Company returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders. In 2007 and 2008 combined, the Company expects to return at least an additional $5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.

During 2006, the Company disposed of its entire investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock and as a result, has reflected Chipotles results of operations and transaction gains as discontinued operations. The 2006 results included $671 million of income, or $0.53 per share, related to discontinued operations. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.30 per share, which included impairment and other charges of $134 million ($98 million after tax or $0.07 per share), as well as net incremental tax expense of $0.01 per share primarily related to a one time impact from a tax law change in Canada. In 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.6 billion and $2.04. Income from discontinued operations was $16 million or $0.01 per share, while income from continuing operations was $2.6 billion or $2.03 per share. The 2005 results from continuing operations included a net tax benefit of $73 million or $0.05 per share comprised of $179 million or $0.14 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. tax returns and $106 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate certain foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA). In addition, 2005 included impairment and other charges (credits), net of $28 million pretax income ($12 million after tax or $0.01 per share). In 2004, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.3 billion and $1.79 and income from continuing operations was also $2.3 billion or $1.79 per share. The 2004 income from continuing operations included pretax operating charges of $151 million ($99 million after tax or $0.08 per share) related to a lease accounting correction and $130 million ($116 million after tax or $0.09 per share) related to impairment charges. Results also included pretax nonoperating income of $49 million ($49 million after tax or $0.04 per share) relating to the sale of the Companys interest in a U.S. real estate partnership that resulted in the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. Refer to the Impairment and other charges (credits), net and Discontinued operations sections for further discussion. In 2006, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased primarily due to treasury stock acquisitions exceeding stock option exercises in 2005 and 2006. The Company acquired 98.4 million shares, or $3.7 billion through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding compared with yearend 2005. For 2005, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to 2004. Shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than the prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004. Treasury stock purchased in 2005 offset this higher balance and the impact of options exercised during the year. Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2006, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and net income primarily due to the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound. Consolidated revenues were positively impacted by the stronger Brazilian Real. In 2005, revenues were positively impacted by the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation. In 2004, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and net income due to the strengthening of several major currencies, primarily the Euro.

In the U.S., the increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily driven by our popular breakfast menu featuring Premium Roast Coffee, new products like our Asian Salad and Snack Wrap, and a wide variety of premium chicken options, as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience. In 2005, the increase in revenues was driven by multiple initiatives that delivered variety like the introduction of Premium Chicken Sandwiches, convenience such as cashless payment options and extended hours as well as our focus on value. Europes constant currency increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in France, Germany and Russia (which is entirely Company operated). In addition, revenues in 2006 benefited from positive comparable sales in the U.K., which were offset by the impact of the markets Company operated restaurant closings and sales to franchisees and affiliates throughout the year. In 2005, the increase in revenues was due to strong comparable sales in Russia and positive comparable sales in France and Germany, partly offset by negative comparable sales in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily driven by the consolidation of Malaysia for financial reporting purposes due to an increase in the Companys ownership during the first quarter 2006, expansion and positive comparable sales in China, as well as positive comparable sales in most markets. The increase was partly offset by the 2005 conversion of the Philippines and Turkey (about 325 restaurants) to developmental licensee structures. In 2005, revenues benefited from strong comparable sales in Australia and Taiwan, and were negatively impacted by the Philippines and Turkey as mentioned above. In addition, revenues in 2005 benefited from expansion in China, partly offset by that markets negative comparable sales. 16 Table of Contents The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and the increase in comparable sales for McDonalds restaurants: Systemwide salesMcDonalds restaurants Increase Increaseexcluding currencytranslation 2006 2005 2006 2005 U.S. 6 % 5 % 6 % 5 % Europe 8 4 7 4 APMEA 5 6 8 6 Latin America 21 21 16 13 Canada 12 8 5 1 Total 7 % 6 % 7 % 5 % Comparable salesMcDonalds restaurants Increase 2006 2005 2004 U.S. 5.2 % 4.4 % 9.6 % Europe 5.8 2.6 2.4 APMEA 5.5 4.0 5.6 Latin America 14.6 11.6 13.0 Canada 4.7 0.3 5.4 Total 5.7 % 3.9 % 6.9 % Operating margins Operating margin information and discussions relate to McDonalds restaurants only and exclude non McDonalds brands. Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented about 65% of the combined operating margins in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Franchised margin dollars increased $357 million or 9% (8% in constant currencies) in 2006 and $246 million or 6% as reported and in constant currencies in 2005. The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for more than 85% of the franchised margin dollars in all three years.

In 2005, the Company operated margin percent benefited from positive comparable sales, more than offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Europes Company operated margin percent increased in 2006 primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs throughout the segment. In addition, initiatives in the U.K. such as the closing of certain underperforming restaurants in the first quarter and the sales of Company operated restaurants to franchisees and affiliates throughout the year, contributed to the increase. In 2005, the Company operated margin percent decreased due to higher labor costs and negative comparable sales in the U.K., partly offset by strong performance in Russia. In addition, higher beef costs in 2005 had a negative impact across the segment. In APMEA, the Company operated margin percent in 2006 reflected improving results in China and many other markets. In 2005, the Company operated margin percent was negatively impacted by weak results in South Korea, partly offset by improvements in Hong Kong. Supplemental information regarding Company operated McDonalds restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals. Although direct 17 Table of Contents restaurant operation is significantly more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants, we develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. We report results for Company operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company operated restaurants in our most significant markets will provide an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The tables below seek to illustrate the two components of our Company operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to below as Restaurant margin. The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and service fees. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company operated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and service fees, although rent and service fees for Company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and service fees for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual percentage attributable to rent varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Service fees may also vary by market. As shown below, in disaggregating the components of our Company operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company operated restaurants would be reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of Occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Restaurant margin would reflect rent and service fees paid, and those fees would be accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or operating margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted above, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company operated business. An estimate of costs to support this business was made by the U.S., Canada and our three major markets in Europe. We believe, on average, that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant is typical, but the actual costs will vary by restaurant depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and service fees as a percentage of sales. Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 8% in 2006 and 12% in 2005 (7% and 11% in constant currencies). In 2006, the increase was due to higher employee related costs, including performance based compensation expense. Share based compensation expense due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in 2005.

Effective January 1, 2005, there was a reclassification of certain information technology expenses totaling approximately $22 million from the Corporate & Other segment to the U.S. segment. (2) On January 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R). This accounting standard requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for years prior to the adoption. For 2004, pro forma share based expense as reported in the Companys year end 2004 Form 10 K was $156 million after tax, of which $7 million of expense related to restricted stock units (RSUs) was included in net income. The remaining $149 million after tax ($241 million pretax) was disclosed in a note to the consolidated financial statements, as required, for pro forma purposes. The segments reflected the following pro forma share based expense in 2004 (in millions): U.S.$69; Europe$49; APMEA$22; Latin America$9; Canada$8; Corporate & Other$84; Total$241. The above pro forma increase/(decrease) is using an adjusted 2004 expense which is calculated by adding pro forma share based expense to reported selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 10.8% in 2006 compared with 10.9% in 2005 and 10.4% in 2004, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 4.1% in 2006 compared with 4.0% in 2005 and 3.8% in 2004. On a pro forma basis, share based compensation expense would increase these ratios 1.3 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, for 2004. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. Impairment and other charges (credits), net On a pretax basis, the Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of $134 million in 2006, ($28) million in 2005 and $281 million in 2004 associated with impairment, as well as certain strategic actions in 2006 and a lease accounting correction in 2004. McDonalds management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results.

In 2005, the Company recorded $23 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in South Korea. In addition, the Company recorded $51 million of pretax income, primarily due to the transfer of the Companys ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employee related and lease termination costs. In 2004, the Company recorded $130 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in South Korea. In addition, like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries, the Company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions. Following this review and in consultation with its external auditors, the Company corrected an error in the amount of $151 million pretax in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property. The result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed rent escalations by revising the computation of straight line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods. As the correction related solely to accounting treatment, it did not affect McDonalds historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases. Its effect on the Companys net income per share, cash provided by operations and shareholders equity was immaterial. These adjustments primarily impacted the U.S., China and Boston Market. Other markets were less significantly impacted, as many of the leases outside of the U.S. do not contain fixed rent escalations.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesbusinesses in which the Company actively participates but does not controlrepresents McDonalds share of each affiliates results. These results are reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for partnerships in certain markets such as the U.S., which are reported before income taxes. Results in 2006 increased partly due to improved results from our Japanese affiliate. Results in 2005 decreased primarily due to results from our Japanese affiliate, which included a one time adjustment for restaurant employees back pay. Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables, and other miscellaneous expenses. These amounts can vary significantly by year. In 2006, results included a gain of $26 million related to the sale of an office building in Russia and results for 2005 reflected a $24 million charge related to a supply chain arrangement in Europe. 20 Table of Contents Operating income Consolidated operating income in 2006 and 2005 included higher combined operating margin dollars, partly offset by higher selling, general & administrative expenses compared with the prior year.

The above pro forma increase/(decrease) is using an adjusted 2004 expense which is calculated by subtracting pro forma share based expense from reported operating income. When comparing 2005 to 2004, the following discussion of operating income relates to the pro forma increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation in the table above. In 2006 and 2005, U.S. operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars compared to 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2004, operating income included charges related to the lease accounting correction of $70 million, impairment charges of $10 million and higher asset dispositions compared to 2005. In Europe, results for 2006 reflected strong performance in France and a gain on the sale of an office building in Russia, partly offset by impairment and other charges. In addition, 2006 operating results in the U.K. and Germany contributed to the increase in operating income. In 2005, results reflected strong performance in France and Russia, improved performance in Germany and weak results in the U.K. In addition, results in 2005 included a supply chain charge of $24 million. In APMEA, results for 2006 were driven by strong performance in Australia as well as improved results in China and Japan, partly offset by impairment and other charges. Results for 2005 were positively impacted by strong performance in Australia, partly offset by weak results in Japan, China and South Korea. In addition, lower impairment and other charges in 2005 compared to 2004 benefited the growth rate. In Latin America, results for 2006 and 2005 reflected continued strong sales performance across most markets. In addition, 2006 results included $31 million of impairment and other charges, primarily due to the buy out of certain litigating franchisees in Brazil. In 2005, results reflected lower asset dispositions and other expense compared to 2004. Results for 2006 in the Corporate & Other segment reflected higher performance based compensation, as well as costs related to our biennial worldwide operator convention. Results for 2006 and 2005 included favorable adjustments to certain liabilities established in prior years of $7 million and $26 million, respectively. In 2005, results benefited from lower share based compensation, certain information technology expenses that are now reflected in the U.S. segment and lower performance based compensation compared to 2004. Interest expense Interest expense for 2006 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of activity related to HIA, funded by local borrowings, in late 2005 and higher average interest rates. In late fourth quarter 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $3 billion of certain foreign historical earnings under HIA, which had a minimal impact on the average debt levels for 2005. Interest expense for 2005 reflected higher average interest rates and lower average debt levels compared with 2004.

Translation losses primarily relate to the net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and minority interest. Interest income increases for 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to higher cash levels. Provision for income taxes In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.0%, 29.6%, and 28.8%, respectively. The 2006 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a tax law change in Canada. In 2005, the effective tax rate included a benefit of $179 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by approximately $106 million of expense related to the Companys decision to take advantage of the onetime opportunity provided under HIA. The effective income tax rate for 2004 benefited from an international transaction and the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.1 billion in both 2006 and 2005. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Discontinued operations In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $121 million to Chipotle and a tax free gain to McDonalds of $32 million reflecting an increase in the carrying value of the Companys investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonalds sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61 million and an additional gain of $13 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonalds sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $268 million and a gain of $128 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In October 2006, the Company completely separated from Chipotle through a tax free exchange of its remaining Chipotle shares for McDonalds common stock. McDonalds accepted 18.6 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the 16.5 million shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonalds and recorded a tax free gain of $480 million in the fourth quarter. As a result of the complete disposition of Chipotle, the Company has reflected Chipotles results of operations through the date of the exchange and transaction gains as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accounting changes SFAS Statement No. 123(R) Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS No. 123(R)) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost in 2005 includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all share based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and (2) all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Refer to the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this item. SFAS Statement No. 158 In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year changes occur through other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, as required. This resulted in a net adjustment to other comprehensive income of $89 million, for a limited number of applicable international markets. EITF Issue 06 2 In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). Under EITF 06 2, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. Previously, the Company expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. The Company adopted EITF 06 2 effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, we expect to record a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings of approximately $35 million in the first quarter of 2007. We expect the annual impact to earnings to be insignificant. FASB Interpretation No. 48 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements; however, we do not expect the impact to be significant. SFAS Statement No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008, as required. We cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adoption at this time. 22 Table of Contents CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash provided by operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments. Cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.6 billion in 2006, while cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.7 billion in 2005. In 2006, cash provided by operations was flat compared to 2005 due to increased operating results, offset by changes in working capital primarily due to higher 2006 income tax payments. In 2005, cash provided by operations increased $433 million compared to 2004 due to strong operating results, primarily in the U.S., and changes in working capital. The changes in working capital in 2005 benefited from lower income tax payments compared with the prior year. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2006, a decrease of $544 million compared to 2005. The increase in capital expenditures was more than offset by the proceeds from the disposition of Chipotle as well as the sales of short term investments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.8 billion in 2005, an increase of $435 million compared with 2004 primarily due to higher capital expenditures and increased purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.2 billion in 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $362 million in 2005. The 2006 activity was due to higher shares repurchased, higher net debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend. In 2005, cash provided by financing activities increased $2.0 billion primarily due to $2.9 billion of local borrowings related to HIA and higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The increase was partly offset by higher shares repurchased, higher debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend compared to 2004. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance decreased $2.1 billion in 2006 to $2.1 billion, compared to an increase of $2.9 billion in 2005. In addition to cash and equivalents and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2006, the Company opened 643 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 101 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 284 traditional restaurants and 180 satellite restaurants. In 2005, the Company opened 558 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 120 satellite restaurants, and closed 145 traditional restaurants and 263 satellite restaurants. About 65% and 70% of McDonalds restaurant openings occurred in the major markets in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(2) Represents Boston Market restaurants. In 2007, the Company expects to open about 700 traditional McDonalds restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants and close about 250 traditional restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants. Approximately 60% of Company operated restaurants and about 85% of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2006. Franchisees and affiliates operated about 75% of McDonalds restaurants at year end 2006. Boston Market restaurants are Company operated. Capital expenditures increased $135 million or 8% in 2006 and $188 million or 13% in 2005. The increase in capital expenditures in both years was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. Capital expenditures in both years reflects the Companys focus on growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world. Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $63 million, $84 million and $98 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and primarily related to new Chipotle restaurants. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in both 2006 and 2005 were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and or opportunities for long term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2006, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants averaged approximately $2.2 million in the U.S. and approximately 23 Table of Contents $1.9 million in the nine markets where development was concentrated outside the U.S. For 2007, the U.S., China and eight other consolidated markets are expected to open more than 500 restaurants. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and nearly 70% of the buildings for its restaurants at year end 2006 and 2005. Share repurchases and dividends In 2006, the Company returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares acquired and dividends paid. In 2007 and 2008 combined, the Company expects to return at least an additional $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of additional share repurchases and dividends. Shares acquired and dividends IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2006 2005 2004 Number of shares acquired(1) 98.4 39.5 22.2 Dividends declared per share $ 1.00 $ .67 $ .55 Dollar amount of shares acquired(1) $ 3,719 $ 1,228 $ 605 Dividends 1,217 842 695 Total returned to shareholders $ 4,936 $ 2,070 $ 1,300 (1) Includes 18.6 million shares or $743.6 million acquired through the October 2006 Chipotle exchange. During 2006, the Company completed a $5.0 billion share repurchase program initially authorized by the Board of Directors in 2001. In March 2006, a new $5.0 billion program was authorized. Through 2006, approximately 36 million shares have been repurchased for $1.5 billion under this new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by approximately 5% compared with 2005. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 31 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The Company has more than quadrupled the dividend from $0.235 per share in 2002 to $1.00 per share in 2006, totaling about $1.2 billion. This reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets decreased by $1.0 billion or 3% in 2006. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.3 billion in 2006, which was more than offset by a decrease in cash and the disposition of Chipotle. More than 65% of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at year end 2006. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion in 2006 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Total assets at December 31, 2005 included $2.9 billion of cash borrowed under HIA due to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Operating income, which excludes interest income, is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2006 2005 2004 Return on average assets(1) 14.9 % 14.5 % 13.5 % Return on average common equity 18.5 17.7 17.8 (1) Return on average assets has been negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the Companys repatriation of certain earnings related to HIA in 2005. Cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 2.2 percentage points, 1.2 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced/(increased) return on average assets by 0.4 percentage points, (0.2) percentage points and 0.9 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, these items along with the 2005 net tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement and incremental tax expense in connection with HIA and the 2004 nonoperating gain on the sale of a U.S. real estate partnership, reduced/(increased) return on average common equity by 0.6 percentage points, (0.6) percentage points and 1.3 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006 and 2005, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S. In addition, returns in 2006 benefited from improved results in Europe. During 2007, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonalds restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2006 totaled $8.4 billion, compared with $10.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The net decrease in 2006 was primarily due to net repayments ($2.3 billion) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) noncash fair value adjustments ($82 million), partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($605 million).

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. 24 Table of Contents (4) HIA related borrowings caused an 18 percentage point decrease in fixed rate debt in 2005. There was a slight increase in fixed rate debt in 2006 as the Company began to repay a portion of the HIA related borrowings. (5) HIA related borrowings caused an 8 percentage point increase in foreign currency denominated debt in 2005. Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch currently rate the Companys commercial paper P 1, A 1 and F1, respectively; and its long term debt A2, A and A, respectively. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, which includes debt outstanding on the Companys balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $7 billion and $11 billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 25% of Company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Companys estimate); capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. The Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as a U.S. shelf registration of debt securities and a Euro Medium Term Notes program that each have approximately $2.9 billion of Company authority remaining for future debt issuances. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Companys Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and 2005 primarily in miscellaneous other assets ($41 million and $83 million, respectively) and other long term liabilities ($166 million and $103 million, respectively). See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2006 and 2005, the Company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to HIA. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.8 billion and $8.1 billion for the years ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was required to post collateral of $49 million and $24 million, respectively. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2006 2005 Euro $ 2,758 $ 2,073 Canadian Dollars 1,099 1,070 Australian Dollars 837 682 British Pounds Sterling 770 822 Brazilian Reais 431 395 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2006 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2006 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. 25 Table of Contents Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2006. (See discussions of Cash flows and Financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $109 million of SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments. This effect is excluded because these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the Companys qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $379 million at December 31, 2006 and $366 million at December 31, 2005 and were included in other long term liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. In addition to long term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $12 million at December 31, 2006. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity: Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods. Share based compensation The Company has share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and RSUs to employees and non employee directors. The expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Long lived assets impairment review Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. The biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. 26 Table of Contents Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2005, the Company recorded a $179 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the Companys 20002002 U.S. tax returns. The Companys 2003 2004 U.S. tax returns are under audit and are expected to be settled in 2007. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $5 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices inflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, from the base period. The denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities adjusted for cash generated from (used for) investing activities related to Chipotle. The weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2006 cash used for investing activities is weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2006 cash used for investing activities is included in the one year and three year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2005 cash used for investing activities is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2006 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2005 cash used for investing activities is included in the one year and three year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 27 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year ROIIC are as follows: One year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Operating income $4,445.1 $3,992.5 $ 452.6 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,224.9 1,220.3 4.6 Currency translation(2) (41.2 ) Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 416.0 DENOMINATOR: Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $1,661.4 Currency translation(2) 12.6 Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $1,674.0 One year ROIIC(4) 24.9 % (1) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations.
