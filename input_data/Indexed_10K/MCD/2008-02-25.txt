ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company primarily franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 31,377 restaurants in 118 countries at year end 2007, 20,505 are operated by franchisees (including 2,781 operated by developmental licensees), 3,966 are operated by affiliates and 6,906 are operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&eacute;cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This ensures long term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, while the Company generally has no capital invested. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix (that is, our mix among Company operated, franchised, conventional or developmental license, and affiliated) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve both goals. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants, and in collaboration with our franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. Our Company operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations. Revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20 year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries & Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities and certain investments. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 35%, 39% and 16% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 60% of Europes revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for long term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during the third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Markets and Chipotles results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because we believe they better represent the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction, reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, and natural disasters. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales. The Company refers to this impact as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment. This impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales. Typically, the annual impact is minimal, with the exception of leap years. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because it is the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. 11 Table of Contents Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. Strategic direction and financial performance The unique business relationship among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success over the years. This business model enables McDonalds to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers. In addition, it facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business worldwide. Since implementing the customer centered Plan to Win several years ago, our focus has been on being better, not just bigger. Our strategic alignment behind this plan has created better McDonalds experiences through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences people, products, place, price and promotion. While our focus has remained the same, we have adapted and evolved our initiatives based on the changing needs and preferences of our customers. These multiple initiatives have increased our consumer relevance and contributed to sales and guest counts worldwide increasing every year since 2003. As a result, we have met or exceeded our long term financial targets, excluding the 2007 impact of the sale of 18 Latin American and Caribbean markets to a developmental licensee. These targets, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, include average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. We believe our financial targets are realistic and sustainable and enable our management to focus on those opportunities that best optimize long term shareholder value. In 2007, we built on our strong performance by focusing on what consumer insights indicate are key drivers of our global business today convenience, branded affordability, daypart expansion and menu choice. Leveraging our ability to replicate and scale success in these areas worldwide, we drove global comparable sales up 6.8% and extended the number of consecutive monthly increases to 56 through December 2007. In the U.S., our momentum continued as we further built on our market leading breakfast business; introduced new products such as the Southwest Salad, Cinnamon Melts and the McSkillet Burrito; extended our Snack Wrap line and offered greater beverage choices including Premium Roast iced coffee and sweet tea. These initiatives, along with longer operating hours and everyday value, resonated with consumers to drive increased customer visits and increased sales. In addition, our efforts to strengthen employee engagement and optimize efficiency in the drive thru and at breakfast helped us to better serve even more customers. In Europe, we sustained strong sales growth in virtually every country. Primary contributors to this performance included France, Germany, Russia and the U.K. Our success in Europe was driven by continued execution along three key priorities: upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency, and enhancing local relevance. Key initiatives included reimaging more than 600 locations, actively communicating McDonalds food quality, nutrition and employment facts and implementing a new kitchen operating system, which is now in over half of our European restaurants, to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety. In addition, we satisfied consumer desire for choice and value with locally relevant menus that feature a blend of premium sandwiches and salads, classic menu favorites, new products, limited time food promotions as well as everyday value offerings. In APMEA, our business posted strong sales performance, driven by positive comparable sales in nearly every country, led by Japan, Australia and China. In addition, restaurant expansion in China where we believe our growth potential is significant contributed to revenue and operating income growth. Throughout APMEA, we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants offering 24 hours or extended hours of service to approximately 4,500. We also continued to deliver value to customers through branded affordability platforms and offer menu choice and variety with locally relevant core menu extensions such as the Teriyaki Mac in Japan and variations of the Filet O Fish in China. In addition, we invigorated our breakfast business in APMEA with the national launch of breakfast in China and the introduction of McGriddles sandwiches in Japan. Strong global performance generated $4.9 billion of cash from operations in 2007. About $1.9 billion of this cash was invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and build new ones. For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2007, we increased our annual dividend 50% to $1.50 per share more than six times higher than the amount paid in 2002 and repurchased over 77 million shares for $3.9 billion. In 2007, we took a number of steps to strengthen managements focus on the core McDonalds business and those markets that have the largest impact on results. We sold our investment in Boston Market in 2007, receiving proceeds of approximately $250 million. In addition, the Company retained about 50 sites, the majority of which will be converted to McDonalds restaurants. We also made significant progress enhancing the mix of franchised and Company operated restaurants, including executing our developmental license strategy, to maximize long term brand performance and returns. Under a developmental license, a local entrepreneur owns the business, including controlling the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the McDonalds Brand and optimize long term sales and profitability. The Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital for new restaurants or reinvestments. We have successfully used this structure for more than 15 years and had it in place in 59 countries at year end 2007. In August 2007, we completed the transition of 1,571 restaurants in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, 12 Table of Contents Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental license structure. The Company refers to these markets as Latam. Based on approval by the Companys Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the held for sale criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities in McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet totaling $179 million at year end 2007. The buyers of the Companys operations in Latam have entered into a 20 year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonalds restaurants over the first three years and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants. In addition, we transitioned another five small markets in Europe with a total of 24 restaurants to the developmental license structure in 2007. We also made progress franchising certain Company operated restaurants in key markets. As a result of our developmental license strategy and franchising initiatives, the percent of franchised and affiliated restaurants worldwide increased from 74% at year end 2006 to 78% at year end 2007. Highlights from the year included: Comparable sales increased 6.8% building on a 5.7% increase in 2006. Systemwide sales increased 12% (8% in constant currencies). Company operated margins reached an eight year high of 17.3%. Franchised margins were 81.5% a level not achieved in over ten years. Cash provided by operations totaled $4.9 billion and capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion. The Company announced that for 2007 through 2009, we expect to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2007, the Company raised its annual dividend by 50% to $1.50 per share, or $1.8 billion, and repurchased 77.1 million shares for $3.9 billion, driving a reduction of over 3% of total shares outstanding at year end compared with 2006. One year ROIIC was 49.9% and three year ROIIC was 39.4% for 2007. Outlook for 2008 The McDonalds System is energized by our current worldwide momentum. We intend to build on this momentum by continuing to execute our Plan to Win with its strategic focus on our customers and restaurants while exercising disciplined financial management. As we do so, we are confident we will continue to meet or exceed the long term financial targets previously discussed. We will continue to drive success in 2008 and beyond by leveraging key consumer insights and our global experience, while relying on our strengths in developing, testing and implementing initiatives surrounding our global business drivers of convenience, branded affordability, daypart expansion and menu variety. In the U.S., our key areas of focus will be breakfast, chicken, beverages and convenience. In 2008, we expect to build on our breakfast momentum and at the same time extend our leadership in the chicken category with the launch of the Southern Style Chicken Biscuit Sandwich for breakfast and the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich for the remainder of the day. We will also continue to provide value and convenience to solidify our connection with consumer lifestyles. In addition, as part of a comprehensive, multi year beverage business strategy designed to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category, we will begin introducing hot specialty coffee offerings in 2008, on a market by market basis. It will not be until late 2009 when we will begin to recognize the full sales benefit of our beverage opportunity. This first component of our beverage business may require construction, new equipment, new processes and training in our restaurants; all of which will serve as a platform for the anticipated future introduction of smoothies, frappes and other beverage options. In Europe, we plan to strengthen our local relevance using a tiered menu approach featuring premium selections, classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings. We will complement these with new products and limited time food promotions developed in our European food studio. Building greater brand transparency will remain a priority in Europe, especially in the U.K., with ongoing communication efforts highlighting the quality of our food and building our reputation as an employer of choice. We will also create stronger bonds of trust by being accessible and maintaining an open dialogue with customers and key stakeholders. As part of our efforts to upgrade the customer experience, we will continue remodeling additional restaurants in the U.K. and Germany. In Germany, an integral part of our reimaging program includes adding about 100 McCafes in 2008. We will also continue installing our new kitchen operating system to ensure that we can consistently deliver high food quality, with a goal for this new system to be in virtually all of our European restaurants by the end of 2009. In APMEA, locally relevant execution of our strategies surrounding convenience, breakfast, core menu extensions and value is essential to sustaining momentum in this diverse and dynamic part of the world. Convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24 hours or extended hours of service, offering delivery service in certain countries and building our drive thru business, particularly in China. In addition, we will continue to emphasize breakfast to further build this daypart, communicate our everyday value offerings and feature limited time variations of classic menu favorites. 13 Table of Contents We believe locally owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage and make us not just a global brand but a locally relevant one. To that end, we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns. We completed a detailed analysis of the appropriate ownership mix in key markets around the world taking into account our plans for each of those markets, the risks associated with operating in the market and restaurant level results. This analysis also considered the current legal and regulatory environment which, in some countries such as China and Russia, may make it prudent for the Company to own and operate the restaurants. Based on this analysis, we expect to refranchise a total of 1,000 to 1,500 existing Company operated restaurants, primarily in our major markets, over the next three or more years. This will be dependent on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets. In addition, we will continue to evaluate several small markets in APMEA and Europe for potential transition to developmental license structures. We will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long term. Our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest, the strength and stability of our cash flow and for our returns. As a result, we expect free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures will continue to grow and be a significant source of cash used to fund our total cash returned to shareholders target for 2007 through 2009 of $15 billion to $17 billion. In addition, we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in the share count in the years ahead. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than 1 percentage point to 2008 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 503 net traditional restaurants added in 2007. The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2.5 cents. Similarly, an increase of 1 percentage point in Europes comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2.5 cents. In 2008, U.S. beef costs are expected to be relatively flat and chicken costs are expected to rise about 4% to 5%. In Europe, beef costs are expected to be relatively flat in 2008, while chicken costs are expected to increase approximately 6% to 8%. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. The Company expects full year 2008 selling, general & administrative expenses to decline, in constant currencies, although fluctuations may be experienced between the quarters due to items such as the 2008 biennial worldwide owner/operator convention, the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the August 2007 sale of the Companys businesses in Latam. Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2008 to increase approximately 15% to 20% compared with 2007, while 2008 interest income is expected to be about half of 2007 interest income. A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 65% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction compared with 2007, the Companys annual net income per share would change by about 8 cents to 9 cents. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2008 to be approximately 30% to 32%, although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2008 to be approximately $2 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open 1,000 restaurants (950 traditional and 50 satellites). We expect net additions of about 600 (700 net traditional additions and 100 net satellite closings). For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2007, the Company returned $5.7 billion of this goal to shareholders. As a result of the new developmental licensee structure, the Companys operating results in Latin America will reflect royalty income of approximately 5% of sales and minimal selling, general & administrative expenses to support the business. We continually review our restaurant ownership structures to maximize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance. We expect to optimize our restaurant ownership mix by refranchising 1,000 to 1,500 Company operated restaurants over the next three or more years, primarily in our major markets, and by continuing to execute our developmental license strategy. In February 2008, a European private equity firm agreed to acquire U.K. based Pret a Manger. As part of that transaction and consistent with its focus on the McDonalds restaurant business, McDonalds has agreed to sell its minority interest in Pret a Manger. The Company expects to recognize a nonoperating gain upon the closing of the transaction in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2008, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 14 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Operating results DOLLARS IN MILLIONS,EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2007 2006 2005 Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 16,611 8 % $ 15,402 10 % $ 14,018 Revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants 6,176 12 5,493 8 5,099 Total revenues 22,787 9 20,895 9 19,117 Operating costs and expenses Company operated restaurant expenses 13,742 6 12,905 8 11,919 Franchised restaurantsoccupancy expenses 1,140 8 1,058 4 1,021 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,367 3 2,296 8 2,118 Impairment and other charges (credits), net 1,670 nm 134 nm (28 ) Other operating (income) expense, net (11 ) nm 69 (33 ) 103 Total operating costs and expenses 18,908 15 16,462 9 15,133 Operating income 3,879 (12 ) 4,433 11 3,984 Interest expense 410 2 402 13 356 Nonoperating income, net (103 ) (16 ) (123 ) nm (32 ) Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 3,572 (14 ) 4,154 13 3,660 Provision for income taxes 1,237 (4 ) 1,288 19 1,082 Income from continuing operations 2,335 (19 ) 2,866 11 2,578 Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35, $102 and $17) 60 nm 678 nm 24 Net income $ 2,395 (32 )% $ 3,544 36 % $ 2,602 Income per common sharediluted Continuing operations $ 1.93 (16 )% $ 2.29 13 % $ 2.02 Discontinued operations 0.05 nm 0.54 nm 0.02 Net income $ 1.98 (30 )% $ 2.83 39 % $ 2.04 Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted 1,211.8 1,251.7 1,274.2 nm Not meaningful. In addition to the consolidated operating results shown above, consolidated results for 2007 are presented in the following table, excluding the impact of the Latam developmental license transaction.

The tax benefit of $62 million was minimal due to the Companys inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. ** The results for the full year 2006 included impairment and other charges of $134 million of operating expenses primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns. *** The following items positively impacted the growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted income per share by 15 percentage points and 12 percentage points, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with 2006: 2007 $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. 2006 $0.08 per share of operating expenses primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns; and $0.01 per share of net incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Net income and diluted net income per common share In 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per share resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. In 2006, net income and diluted net income per common share were $3.5 billion and $2.83. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.29 per share, which included $134 million ($98 million after tax or $0.08 per share) of impairment and other charges primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns, as well as $0.01 per share of net incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $678 million or $0.54 per share. In 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.6 billion and $2.04. Income from continuing operations was $2.6 billion or $2.02 per share, while income from discontinued operations was $24 million or $0.02 per share. The 2005 results from continuing operations included a net tax benefit of $73 million or $0.05 per share comprised of $179 million or $0.14 per share tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by $106 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate certain foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA).

Refer to the Impairment and other charges (credits), net and Discontinued operations sections for further discussion. In 2007, the Company repurchased 77.1 million shares for $3.9 billion, driving a reduction of over 3% of total shares outstanding compared with year end 2006, after considering stock option exercises. In 2006, the Company acquired 98.4 million shares or $3.7 billion, through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding compared with year end 2005, after considering stock option exercises. 16 Table of Contents Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and net income per share, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2006, consolidated revenues, operating income and net income were positively impacted by the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound. Consolidated revenues in 2006 were also positively impacted by the stronger Brazilian Real. In 2005, consolidated revenues were positively impacted by the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation.

New products introduced in 2007 included the Southwest Salad and an extended Snack Wrap line, while new products introduced in 2006 included Snack Wraps and the Asian Salad. Europes constant currency increase in revenues in 2007 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in France, Russia (which is entirely Company operated), the U.K. and Germany, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In 2006, the increase in revenues was due to strong comparable sales in France, Germany and Russia. In addition, revenues in 2006 benefited from positive comparable sales in the U.K., which were partly offset by the impact of closing certain Company operated restaurants. The increases for both 2007 and 2006 were partly offset by a higher proportion of franchised and affiliated restaurants compared with the prior year, primarily due to sales of Company operated restaurants, in conjunction with our overall franchising strategy, specifically in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2007 was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in China and Australia, as well as positive comparable sales in substantially all other markets. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increase. In 2006, the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the consolidation of Malaysia for financial reporting purposes due to an increase in the Companys ownership during the first quarter 2006, expansion and positive comparable sales in China, as well as positive comparable sales in most markets. The increase was partly offset by the 2005 conversion of the Philippines and Turkey (about 325 restaurants) to developmental license structures. In Other Countries & Corporate, Company operated sales declined in 2007 while franchised and affiliated revenues increased as a result of the completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 65% of the combined restaurant margins in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Franchised margin dollars increased $601 million or 14% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007 and $357 million or 9% (8% in constant currencies) in 2006. The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for about 85% of the franchised margin dollars in all three years.

The 2007 increase in franchised margin for Other Countries & Corporate is primarily due to the sale of Latam in August 2007. As a result of the sale, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars represent sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars increased $372 million or 15% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007 and increased $398 million or 19% (17% in constant currencies) in 2006.

In 2006, the Company operated margin percent increased due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs, commodity costs and utilities. Europes Company operated margin percent increased in 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and commodity costs. In 2006, the Company operated margin percent increased due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. In addition, initiatives in the U.K., such as the closing of certain underperforming restaurants in the first quarter 2006 and the sales of Company operated restaurants to franchisees and affiliates, contributed to the increases in 2006, and to a lesser extent, 2007. In APMEA, the Company operated margin percent in 2007 increased due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. In both years, the Company operated margin percent reflected improved results in China and many other markets. In Other Countries & Corporate, the Company operated margin in 2007 reflected Latam operations through July 2007 and the benefit due to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid April through July 2007. Supplemental information regarding Company operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals. Although direct restaurant operation is significantly more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. In addition, we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. We report results for Company operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to below as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company operated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalties may also vary by market. As shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted above, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company operated business. An estimate of costs to support this business was made by the U.S. and our three major markets in Europe. We believe, on average, that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant is typical, but the actual costs will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. 19 Table of Contents U.S. Europe DOLLARS IN MILLIONS 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 As reported Number of Company operated restaurants at year end 2,090 2,104 2,097 2,177 2,253 2,382 Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 4,682 $ 4,410 $ 4,098 $ 6,817 $ 5,885 $ 5,465 Company operated margin $ 876 $ 843 $ 768 $ 1,205 $ 960 $ 817 Store operating margin Company operated margin $ 876 $ 843 $ 768 $ 1,205 $ 960 $ 817 Plus: Outside rent expense (1) 82 82 79 248 229 225 Depreciation buildings & leasehold improvements(1) 78 74 68 107 98 97 Less: Rent & royalties(2) (691 ) (651 ) (605 ) (1,294 ) (1,099 ) (1,048 ) Store operating margin $ 345 $ 348 $ 310 $ 266 $ 188 $ 91 Brand/real estate margin Rent & royalties(2) $ 691 $ 651 $ 605 $ 1,294 $ 1,099 $ 1,048 Less: Outside rent expense (1) (82 ) (82 ) (79 ) (248 ) (229 ) (225 ) Depreciation buildings & leasehold improvements(1) (78 ) (74 ) (68 ) (107 ) (98 ) (97 ) Brand/real estate margin $ 531 $ 495 $ 458 $ 939 $ 772 $ 726 (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy & other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2007 and 8% (7% in constant currencies) in 2006. In 2007, higher employee related costs were offset by a reduction in costs due to the Latam transaction. In 2006, the increase was due to higher employee related costs, including performance based compensation expense.

In addition, the Company recorded a $16 million write off of assets associated with the Toasted Deli Sandwich products in Canada and a net gain of $14 million as a result of the transfer of the Companys ownership interest in three European markets to a developmental licensee, partly offset by a loss on the anticipated transfer of a small market in Europe to a developmental licensee. In 2006, the Company recorded $134 million of pretax impairment charges primarily related to the following items: losses incurred on the transfers of the Companys ownership interest in certain markets to developmental licensees ($36 million); the closing of certain restaurants in the U.K. in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review ($35 million); costs to buy out certain litigating franchisees in Brazil ($29 million); asset write offs and other charges in APMEA ($18 million); and a loss related to the decision to dispose of supply chain operations in Russia ($13 million). In 2005, the Company recorded $23 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in South Korea. In addition, the Company recorded $51 million of pretax income, primarily due to the transfer of the Companys ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employee related and lease termination costs.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company operated restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy in the Companys major markets.

These results are reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for partnerships in certain markets such as the U.S., which are reported before income taxes. Results in 2007 and 2006 increased partly due to improved results from our Japanese affiliate. Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables, and other miscellaneous expenses.

In order to provide managements view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. In 2007 and 2006, U.S. operating income included higher combined restaurant margin dollars compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively. In Europe, results for 2007 were driven by strong performance in France, the U.K. and Russia, as well as positive results in most other markets. Impairment and other charges (credits) benefited the growth rate in 2007. In 2006, results reflected strong performance in France and a gain on the sale of an office building in Russia, partly offset by impairment and other charges. In addition, operating results in the U.K. and Germany contributed to the 2006 increase in operating income. In APMEA, results for 2007 were driven by improved results in China, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and most other markets. Results for 2006 reflected strong performance in Australia as well as improved results in China and Japan, partly offset by impairment and other charges. In Other Countries & Corporate, results for 2007 and 2006 reflected strong sales performance across most markets in Latin America. Results for 2006 also reflected higher performance based compensation, as well as costs related to our biennial worldwide owner/operator convention. Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 17.0%, 21.2% and 20.8%, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits) negatively impacted the 2007 and 2006 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, and positively impacted the 2005 combined operating margin by 0.1 percentage point. Interest expense Interest expense for 2007 increased primarily due to higher average interest rates and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels. Interest expense for 2006 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of activity related to HIA, funded by local borrowings in late 2005, and higher average interest rates. In late 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $3 billion of certain foreign historical earnings under HIA.

Translation losses primarily relate to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and minority interest. Interest income decreased for 2007 primarily due to lower average cash levels, while 2006 increased primarily due to higher cash levels. Provision for income taxes In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the reported effective income tax rates were 34.6%, 31.0%, and 29.6%, respectively. In 2007, the effective income tax rate was higher by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to net expense of $1,641 million associated with the Latam transaction. This benefit was minimal due to our inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. In 2005, the effective income tax rate included a benefit of $179 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by $106 million of expense related to the Companys decision to take advantage of the one time opportunity provided under HIA. The net of these items decreased the effective income tax rate by about 2 percentage points. 22 Table of Contents Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in 2007 and $1.2 billion in 2006. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Discontinued operations The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during the third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings in the first and second quarters and a tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock in the fourth quarter. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Markets and Chipotles results of operations and transaction gains are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In connection with the Companys sale of its investment in Boston Market in August 2007, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Markets net income (loss) for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was ($9) million, $7 million and $9 million, respectively. In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in a tax free gain to McDonalds of $32 million to reflect an increase in the carrying value of the Companys investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonalds sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61 million and an additional gain of $14 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonalds sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $267 million and a gain of $128 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company completely separated from Chipotle through a noncash, tax free exchange of its remaining Chipotle shares for its common stock. McDonalds accepted 18.6 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the 16.5 million shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonalds and recorded a tax free gain of $480 million. In addition, Chipotles net income for 2006 and 2005 was $18 million and $16 million, respectively. Accounting changes SFAS Statement No. 158 In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year changes occur through other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, as required. This resulted in a net adjustment to other comprehensive income of $89 million, for a limited number of applicable international markets. EITF Issue 06 2 In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). Under EITF 06 2, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. Previously, the Company expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. The Company adopted EITF 06 2 effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, we recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings of this accounting change is not significant. FASB Interpretation No. 48 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of FIN 48, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long term and included in other long term liabilities. SFAS Statement No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157, as issued, are effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). We adopted the required provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008. The annual impact of this accounting change is not expected to be significant. 23 Table of Contents SFAS Statement No. 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has decided not to adopt this optional standard. SFAS Statement No. 141(R) In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values, changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from preacquisition contingencies, and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS Statement No. 160 In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB 51)) (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 becomes effective beginning January 1, 2009 and is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the reclassification of noncontrolling interests to equity and the recasting of net income (loss) attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests, which are required to be adopted retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments. Cash provided by operations totaled $4.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.9 billion in 2007, while cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.6 billion in 2006. In 2007, cash provided by operations increased $535 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased operating results and lower income tax payments. In 2006, cash provided by operations was flat compared to 2005 due to increased operating results, offset by changes in working capital primarily due to higher income tax payments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.2 billion in 2007, a decrease of $124 million compared to 2006, primarily due to net proceeds received from the Latam transaction and the sale of Boston Market in 2007, partly offset by higher capital expenditures in 2007. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2006, a decrease of $544 million compared to 2005. The increase in capital expenditures was more than offset by the proceeds from the disposition of Chipotle as well as the sales of short term investments. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2007, a decrease of $1.5 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividend in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2006, cash used for financing activities totaled $5.5 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of $442 million in 2005. The 2006 activity reflected higher shares repurchased, higher net debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance decreased $147 million in 2007 to $2.0 billion, compared to a decrease of $2.1 billion in 2006. In addition to cash and equivalents and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2007, the Company opened 743 traditional restaurants and 93 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 240 traditional restaurants and 265 satellite restaurants. In 2006, the Company opened 643 traditional restaurants and 101 satellite restaurants, and closed 284 traditional restaurants and 180 satellite restaurants. About 65% of the restaurant openings occurred in the major markets in both 2007 and 2006.

In 2008, the Company expects to open about 950 traditional restaurants and 50 satellite restaurants (of which the U.S., China and six other consolidated markets are expected to open more than 550 restaurants) and close about 250 traditional restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants. Approximately 65% of Company operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2007. Franchisees and affiliates operated 78% of the restaurants at year end 2007. Capital expenditures increased $205 million or 12% in 2007 and $135 million or 8% in 2006. The increase in capital expenditures in 2007 was primarily due to increased investment in new restaurants, primarily in Europe and the U.S., and the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. Capital expenditures in both years reflected 24 Table of Contents the Companys focus on growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world. Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $10 million, $82 million and $110 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The expenditures in 2007 primarily related to investment in existing Boston Market restaurants and expenditures in 2006 and 2005, primarily related to new Chipotle restaurants. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented approximately 75% of the total in 2007 and about 70% of the total in 2006 and 2005. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. Capital expenditures IN MILLIONS 2007 2006 2005 New restaurants $ 687 $ 530 $ 511 Existing restaurants 1,158 1,075 950 Other properties(1) 102 137 146 Total capital expenditures $ 1,947 $ 1,742 $ 1,607 Total assets $ 29,392 $ 28,974 $ 29,989 (1) Primarily corporate related equipment and furnishings for office buildings. New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and or opportunities for long term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, in 2007, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.5 million. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for its restaurants at year end 2007 and 2006. Share repurchases and dividends In 2007, the Company returned approximately $5.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. Shares repurchased and dividends IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2007 2006 2005 Number of shares repurchased(1) 77.1 98.4 39.5 Shares outstanding at year end 1,165 1,204 1,263 Dividends declared per share $ 1.50 $ 1.00 $ .67 Dollar amount of shares repurchased(1) $ 3,949 $ 3,719 $ 1,228 Dividends paid 1,766 1,217 842 Total returned to shareholders $ 5,715 $ 4,936 $ 2,070 (1) 2006 included 18.6 million shares or $743.6 million acquired through the October 2006 Chipotle exchange. In October 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. The Companys Board of Directors subsequently increased the size of the program by $5.0 billion in March 2006 and $3.0 billion in May 2007. In September 2007, the Company terminated the existing share repurchase program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2007, approximately 77 million shares were repurchased for $3.9 billion, of which 27 million shares or $1.6 billion were purchased under the new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 3% compared with 2006, after considering stock option exercises. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 32 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. In 2007, the Company increased the annual dividend 50% to $1.50 per share or $1.8 billion. At $1.50 per share, the Companys dividend is now more than six times higher than the $0.235 per share paid in 2002, reflecting the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs. The Companys Board of Directors has decided that beginning in 2008, dividends declared will be paid on a quarterly basis, at the Boards discretion. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets increased by $417 million or 1% in 2007. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.4 billion in 2007. This increase was partly offset by the sales of the Latam businesses and Boston Market in 2007. About 70% of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at year end 2007. Net property and equipment increased $1.5 billion in 2007 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Operating income, which excludes interest income, is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2007 2006 2005 Return on average assets 13.2 % 15.0 % 14.6 % Return on average common equity 15.1 18.4 17.6 Return on average assets has been negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the Companys repatriation of earnings related to HIA in 2005. Cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 1.3 percentage points, 2.1 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 25 Table of Contents Impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced/(increased) return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points, 0.4 percentage points and (0.2) percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, these items along with the 2007 and 2005 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of IRS examinations and incremental tax expense in connection with HIA, reduced/(increased) return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points, 0.6 percentage points and (0.5) percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S. and Europe, as well as improved results in APMEA. During 2008, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2007 totaled $9.3 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 2006. The net increase in 2007 was primarily due to net issuances of $573 million and the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $342 million, partly offset by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) noncash fair value adjustments of $23 million.

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. Fitch, Standard & Poors and Moodys currently rate the Companys commercial paper F1, A 1 and P 2, respectively; and its long term debt A, A and A3, respectively. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Companys balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $7 billion and $11 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 25% of Company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Companys estimate); capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. The Company has approximately $7.3 billion of authority to issue debt securities, including debt securities registered on a U.S. shelf registration statement and in connection with a Euro Medium Term Notes program. The Company also has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) and authority to issue commercial paper. In 2008, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt in order to refinance maturing debt and finance a portion of the Companys previously disclosed expectation to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders. Debt maturing in 2008 includes approximately $1.8 billion of outstanding borrowings under the HIA multi currency term loan facility and $800 million of long term corporate debt. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. Derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Companys Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 and 2006 in miscellaneous other assets of $64 million and $41 million, respectively, and other long term liabilities of $70 million and $117 million, respectively. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. 26 Table of Contents The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.1 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was required to post collateral of $55 million and $49 million, respectively, which was used to reduce the carrying value of the derivatives recorded in other long term liabilities. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2007 2006 Euro $ 3,999 $ 2,758 Australian Dollars 1,147 837 Canadian Dollars 929 1,099 British Pounds Sterling 634 770 Russian Ruble 463 359 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2007 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2007 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2007. (See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $85 million of SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $148 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the Companys qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $415 million at December 31, 2007 and $379 million at December 31, 2006 and were included in other long term liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. Also included in other long term liabilities at December 31, 2007 were gross unrecognized tax benefits of $250 million and liabilities for international retirement plans of $129 million. In connection with the Latam transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities in McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet totaling $179 million at year end 2007. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. 27 Table of Contents The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity: Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods. Share based compensation The Company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Long lived assets impairment review Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are held for sale in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and, if required, the Companys Board of Directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. An alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two componentsthe cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. The Company bases its accounting policy on managements determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 28 Table of Contents Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. tax returns. During 2005, the Company recorded a $179 million benefit due to the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2000 2002 U.S. tax returns. The Companys 2005 2006 U.S. tax returns are under audit and the completion is expected in late 2008 or early 2009. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $6.7 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices inflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, from the base period, adjusted for the impact of the Latam developmental license transaction in 2007. While the Company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. The denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle and Latam transactions. The weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2006 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2007 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2006 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 29 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year ROIIC are as follows: One year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $3,879.0 $4,433.0 $ (554.0 ) Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,192.8 1,190.9 1.9 Latam transaction 1,665.3 1,665.3 Currency translation (2) (257.0 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 856.2 DENOMINATOR: Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $ 1,714.9 Currency translation (2) 1.2 Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,716.1 One year ROIIC(4) 49.9 % (1) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations.
