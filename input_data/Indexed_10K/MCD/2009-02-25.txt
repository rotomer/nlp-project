ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 31,967 restaurants in 118 countries at year end 2008, 25,465 were operated by franchisees (including 18,402 operated by conventional franchisees, 2,926 operated by developmental licensees and 4,137 operated by foreign affiliated markets (affiliates) primarily in Japan) and 6,502 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&eacute;cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, while the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our mix of Company operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and affiliated) restaurants to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve both goals. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues, Company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company operated restaurants, and in collaboration with our franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. Our Company operated business also helps to facilitate strategic changes in restaurant ownership. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20 year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries & Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 34%, 42% and 18% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 55% of Europes revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for long term growth remain significant. Accordingly, in second quarter 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K. based Pret A Manger for $229 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recognized a nonoperating gain. During the third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Markets and Chipotles results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to the leap year. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While sales by franchisees are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and 12 Table of Contents records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. Strategic direction and financial performance The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success over the years. This business model enables McDonalds to consistently deliver locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet our customers changing needs and preferences. McDonalds customer centered Plan to Win which is focused on being better, not just bigger provides a common framework for our restaurants yet allows for local adaptation. The Plan facilitates the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences people, products, place, price and promotion. Through the execution of these initiatives, we have enhanced the McDonalds experience for customers worldwide, growing sales and guest counts in each of the last five years. This Plan, coupled with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for shareholders. We have exceeded our long term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plans implementation in 2003, after adjusting 2007 for the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable, enabling us to focus on those opportunities that best optimize long term shareholder value. In 2008, we continued to focus on our key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience and daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Locally relevant initiatives around each of these success factors resonated with consumers increasingly busy lifestyles and their growing demand for menu variety, value and simple, enjoyable eating out experiences. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2008 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 6.9% and 3.1%, respectively, despite a challenging economic environment in many countries. In the U.S., we continued to drive sales higher and increase our share of the informal eating out market in 2008 due to our ongoing focus on breakfast, chicken, beverages, convenience and branded affordability. We extended our leadership in the breakfast and chicken categories with the launch of the Southern Style Chicken Biscuit for breakfast and Southern Style Chicken Sandwich for the remainder of the day. We profitably built greater visit frequency by leveraging our convenient locations, extended hours, drive thru service and value oriented local beverage promotions that often featured our popular Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea. As part of our multi year strategy to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category, we began rolling out espresso based hot and cold specialty coffees. At year end 2008, over 7,000 restaurants were offering the new specialty coffees, and we expect to complete the roll out in mid 2009. To accommodate the related new equipment as well as enable potential future offerings such as smoothies, frappes and bottled beverages, construction is required in many restaurants. In most cases this construction also involves expanding and optimizing the efficiency of our drive thru booth, which enables us to better serve even more customers, faster. The Company is investing capital to fund a portion of this construction related reinvestment for franchised restaurants. In Europe, we posted record high comparable sales growth in 2008. Every country contributed to this performance, which was led by France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. This success was driven in part by greater local customer relevance created by our tiered menu approach, featuring an effective combination of premium selections, classic menu favorites, everyday value and popular limited time food promotions. We also connected with customers throughout the day with new sandwiches such as the Bacon Roll for breakfast in the U.K. and premium M burger in France, Germany and the U.K. We continued upgrading the McDonalds experience by reimaging more than 650 locations, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. In addition, we continued the roll out of a new kitchen operating system currently in about 5,000 of our European restaurants to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety. Open communication and transparency is especially important to European consumers. To build brand trust, we actively communicated the facts about McDonalds as an employer and highlighted the quality and nutrition of our food with the early launch of the Companys new global packaging design. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, driven by Australia, Japan and China. In addition, aggressive restaurant development in China where we opened our 1,000th restaurant contributed to revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strategic initiatives surrounding convenience, breakfast, core menu extensions and value. We further enhanced McDonalds convenience with drive thru and delivery service, as well as expansion of extended hours to 60% (or about 5,000) of our restaurants in APMEA. We built on the momentum of our breakfast business, currently in 70% of our restaurants in APMEA, by raising customer awareness, trial and visit frequency with relevant marketing and new menu offerings like the egg, tomato and pepper McPuff in China. We also continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability platforms and locally relevant new product launches such as the premium chicken line in Australia and New Zealand. Our customer centered strategies to drive global momentum also consider price and product mix as a means to enhance restaurant profitability. This approach is complemented by a focus on optimizing restaurant operations and effectively managing food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies. As a result, amid a volatile commodity environment, McDonalds delivered consolidated Company operated restaurant margins of 17.6% its highest in nine years. Strong sales and margin performance positively impacted growth in cash from operations, which rose $1 billion to $5.9 billion in 2008. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provides us significant flexibility to 13 Table of Contents fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. In 2008, capital expenditures of $2.1 billion were primarily used to open 995 restaurants (590 net, after 405 closings) and reimage 1,450 locations. In addition, we believe strongly in returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In 2008, we returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, consisting of $1.8 billion in dividends and $4.0 billion in share repurchases. This brings total cash returned to $11.5 billion under our 2007 2009 $15 billion to $17 billion target. We are confident we will achieve this cash return target given the ongoing strength and stability of cash from operations and our continued evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital intensive business model. We believe locally owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage, making us not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one. In addition, an optimized mix of franchised and Company operated restaurants helps to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns. To that end, in August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. Under the new ownership structure, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. In addition, in 2007 we set a three year target to refranchise 1,000 to 1,500 existing Company operated restaurants between 2008 and 2010, primarily in our major markets. In 2008, we refranchised about 675 restaurants, increasing the percent of franchised restaurants worldwide to 80% from 78% at year end 2007. This transition to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants is expected to affect consolidated financial statements as follows: A negative impact on consolidated revenues as Company operated sales shift to franchised sales where we receive rent and or royalties, along with initial fees. A decrease in Company operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars, while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants. Fluctuations in Other Operating (Income) Expense due to gains and or losses resulting from sales of restaurants. An increase in combined operating margin percent. An increase in return on average assets due primarily to a decrease in average asset balances. Highlights from the year included: Comparable sales grew 6.9% and guest counts rose 3.1%, building on 2007 increases of 6.8% and 3.8%, respectively. Systemwide sales increased 11% (9% in constant currencies). Company operated margins improved to 17.6% and franchised margins improved to 82.3%. Net income per share from continuing operations was $3.76, an increase of 16% after adjusting for the impact of the 2007 Latin America transaction. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.9 billion and capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion. Returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through shares repurchased and dividends paid, including a 33% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter bringing our current annual dividend rate to $2.00 per share. One year ROIIC was 38.9% and three year ROIIC was 37.5% for 2008. Outlook for 2009 We will continue to drive success in 2009 and beyond by remaining focused on being better, not just bigger. We will do so by further enhancing our understanding of consumers needs and wants; facilitating greater sharing and adoption of best practices and new ideas worldwide; and leveraging a strategic approach to implementing initiatives to drive the best bottom line impact. Despite challenging economic conditions, the McDonalds System is energized by our current worldwide momentum. We will continue to build on our strength in five key areas: maintaining the balance between price and value; maximizing the benefit of available capital by improving the relevance and contemporary feel of our existing restaurants; leveraging the equity and unique tastes of core menu favorites like the Big Mac, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese and our world famous French Fries; continuing our financial discipline and evaluation of success measures to ensure these measures are driving actions that positively impact our restaurants; and furthering operations excellence by focusing on improved execution. As we do so, we are confident we can meet or exceed the long term constant currency financial targets previously discussed. In the U.S., our 2009 focus is to continue to build relevance and loyalty by staying connected to customers needs for menu variety and beverage choice, everyday affordability and convenience. Our initiatives will include reminding customers of the enduring appeal of menu classics such as the Big Mac and encouraging trial of new sandwich and beverage options including specialty coffees. Also in 2009, we will continue to offer value across our menu from the Dollar Menu to our premium products, as well as our classic menu favorites and mid tier offerings such as our Double Cheeseburger and Snack Wraps. These initiatives combined with the convenience of our locations, optimized drive thru service, cashless transactions and longer operating hours will reinforce McDonalds position as our customers preferred place and way to eat. Our priorities in Europe remain upgrading the customer and employee experience, enhancing local relevance and building brand transparency. In 2009, we will continue upgrading our restaurants ambiance through reimaging, including adding another 200 McCafes primarily in Germany and France. In addition, we will focus on optimizing our drive thru service, completing the conversion of our kitchen operating system in most European restaurants and increasing total locations offering extended and 24 hour service. We also will strengthen our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with new products and a relevant variety of limited time food events featuring beef, chicken, desserts and coffee selections. In the area of brand transparency, we will remain open and accessible and will continue to inform consumers about our food quality and reputation as an employer. In APMEA, our goal is to be consumers first choice when eating out. To achieve this goal, locally relevant strategies surrounding convenience, breakfast and branded affordability are essential in this diverse and dynamic part of the world. Convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24 hour or extended operating hours, offering delivery service and building our drive thru 14 Table of Contents traffic. We will also aggressively continue to open new restaurants in China. We will further build our breakfast business in APMEA by increasing the number of locations where it is served, utilizing innovative marketing support and launching new products. At the same time, we will continue to highlight our classic menu favorites and offer locally relevant extensions of these products. In addition, we are further leveraging a strategic pricing tool to optimize menu prices to drive sales and profits. In 2009, we will continue to optimize the mix of franchised and Company operated restaurants and will refranchise restaurants under the previously mentioned target. The speed with which we make progress toward this goal will depend on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets. We will also continue to evaluate several small markets in APMEA and Europe for potential transition to developmental license structures. We will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long term. As previously discussed, our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest, the strength and stability of our cash flow and our long term returns. As a result, we expect free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures will continue to grow and be a significant source to fund total cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in our outstanding share count. Finally, we will continue to be disciplined financially, remaining diligent about how and where we invest capital and selling, general and administrative expenses to grow our business. Consistent with the last few years, to drive sales and returns we will allocate nearly 50% of our $2.1 billion of planned 2009 capital expenditures toward reinvestments in existing restaurants, mainly related to the reimaging of locations in Europe and the rollout of the beverage strategy in the U.S. The remainder of our capital expenditures will primarily be used to build new locations. McDonalds does not provide specific guidance on net income per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly 2 percentage points to 2009 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 709 net traditional restaurants added in 2008. The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual net income per share by about 3 cents. With about 75% of McDonalds grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Companys commodity costs. For the full year 2009, the total basket of goods is expected to rise about 5% to 5.5% in the U.S. and about 4% to 4.5% in Europe with more of this pressure occurring in the first half of the year. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. The Company expects full year 2009 selling, general & administrative expenses to decline, in constant currencies, although fluctuations may be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2008 such as the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and the Beijing Summer Olympics. Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2009 to be relatively flat compared with 2008. Interest income in 2009 is expected to decrease about 80% compared with 2008 due to expected lower average interest rates and average cash balances. A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 45% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Companys operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction compared with 2008, the Companys annual net income per share would change by about 12 to 15 cents. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to virtually all foreign currencies, full year 2009 revenues and operating income will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2009 to be approximately 29% to 31%. In the normal course of business and based on the timing of certain transactions and events, some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2009 to be approximately $2.1 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open about 1,000 restaurants (950 traditional and 50 satellites). The Company expects net additions of about 650 restaurants (750 net traditional additions and 100 net satellite closings). These restaurant numbers include new unit openings (approximately 30%) in affiliated and developmental licensed markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. For 2007 and 2008 combined, the Company returned $11.5 billion to shareholders. The Company continually reviews its restaurant ownership structures to optimize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance. The Company expects to refranchise 1,000 to 1,500 Company operated restaurants between 2008 and 2010, primarily in its major markets, and by continuing to utilize its developmental license strategy. In 2008, the Company refranchised about 675 restaurants, primarily in its major markets. In February 2009, consistent with its focus on the McDonalds restaurant business, McDonalds agreed to sell its minority interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, an automated DVD rental service. The Company expects to recognize a nonoperating gain upon the closing of the transaction in first quarter 2009. 15 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Operating results 2008 2007 2006 Dollars in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 16,561 % $ 16,611 8 % $ 15,402 Revenues from franchised restaurants 6,961 13 6,176 12 5,493 Total revenues 23,522 3 22,787 9 20,895 Operating costs and expenses Company operated restaurant expenses 13,653 (1 ) 13,742 6 12,905 Franchised restaurants occupancy expenses 1,230 8 1,140 8 1,058 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,355 2,367 3 2,296 Impairment and other charges, net 6 nm 1,670 nm 134 Other operating (income) expense, net (165 ) nm (11 ) nm 69 Total operating costs and expenses 17,079 (10 ) 18,908 15 16,462 Operating income 6,443 66 3,879 (12 ) 4,433 Interest expense 523 27 410 2 402 Nonoperating (income) expense, net (78 ) 25 (103 ) (16 ) (123 ) Gain on sale of investment (160 ) nm Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 6,158 72 3,572 (14 ) 4,154 Provision for income taxes 1,845 49 1,237 (4 ) 1,288 Income from continuing operations 4,313 85 2,335 (19 ) 2,866 Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35 and $102) nm 60 nm 678 Net income $ 4,313 80 % $ 2,395 (32 )% $ 3,544 Income per common sharediluted Continuing operations $ 3.76 95 % $ 1.93 (16 )% $ 2.29 Discontinued operations nm 0.05 nm 0.54 Net income $ 3.76 90 % $ 1.98 (30 )% $ 2.83 Weighted average common shares outstandingdiluted 1,146.0 1,211.8 1,251.7 nm Not meaningful. In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as Latam. As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. Based on approval by the Companys Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the held for sale criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet, totaling $142 million at December 31, 2008 and $179 million at December 31, 2007. The change in the balance was primarily due to foreign currency translation. The Company mitigates the currency impact to income through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements. The buyers of the Companys operations in Latam entered into a 20 year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonalds restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants. 16 Table of Contents In addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page, consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 and 2007 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. These results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results. While the Company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.

(1) The results for the full year 2007 included impairment and other charges of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid April 2007, and a tax benefit of $62 million. (2) The following items impact the comparison of adjusted growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with 2007. On a net basis, these items negatively impact the comparison by 7 and 6 percentage points, respectively: 2008 $0.09 per share gain on the sale of the Companys minority interest in Pret A Manger. 2007 $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. (3) The following items impact the comparison of adjusted growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with 2006. On a net basis, these items positively impact the comparison by 15 and 12 percentage points, respectively: 2007 $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. 2006 $0.08 per share of operating expenses primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns; and $0.01 per share of incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Net income and diluted net income per common share In 2008, net income and diluted net income per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million, or $0.09 per share, gain on the sale of the Companys minority interest in Pret A Manger. In 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per share resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. In 2006, net income and diluted net income per common share were $3.5 billion and $2.83. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.29 per share, which included $134 million ($98 million after tax or $0.08 per share) of impairment and other charges primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns, as well as $0.01 per share of net incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $678 million or $0.54 per share. Refer to the Impairment and other charges, net and Discontinued operations sections for further discussion. The Company repurchased 69.7 million shares of its stock for $4.0 billion in 2008 and 77.1 million shares for $3.9 billion in 2007, driving reductions of over 4% and 3% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. 17 Table of Contents Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound. However, in fourth quarter 2008, the U.S. Dollar strengthened significantly against nearly every foreign currency, reducing the full year foreign currency benefit. Due to this strengthening, full year 2009 revenues and operating income will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2006, consolidated operating results were positively impacted by the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound.

Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. In both 2008 and 2007, consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales as well as stronger foreign currencies. Revenue growth in both years was negatively impacted by the Latam transaction. Upon completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of Company operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. Revenue growth in 2008 was also partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the Companys major markets, which resulted in a higher proportion of franchised restaurants compared with 2007.

New products introduced in 2008 included Southern Style Chicken products, Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea, while new products introduced in 2007 included the Southwest Salad and an extended Snack Wrap line. In 2008, revenue growth was largely offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy. Europes constant currency increase in revenues in 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in Russia (which is entirely Company operated), France and the U.K., as well as positive comparable sales in all other markets. These increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, primarily in the U.K. and Germany in 2008 and in the U.K. in 2007. In APMEA, the constant currency increases in revenues in 2008 and 2007 were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Australia and China, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. In Other Countries & Corporate, Company operated sales declined in 2008 and 2007 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the Latam transaction in August 2007.

In addition, the Company expects a decrease in Company operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars, while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants. Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the Companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented about 65% of the combined restaurant margins in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Franchised margin dollars increased $695 million or 14% (11% in constant currencies) in 2008 and $601 million or 14% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007. The August 2007 Latam transaction contributed to the growth in franchised margin dollars in both 2008 and 2007 and the refranchising strategy contributed to the growth in 2008.

In 2008, the U.S. franchised margin percent was negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy. Europes franchised margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy. Higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives also negatively affected the franchised margin percent in 2008. The Company will continue to execute these strategies, which are designed to drive comparable guest count growth and long term profitability and are expected to negatively impact the 2009 franchised margin percent. In Other Countries & Corporate, the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 as a result of the Latam transaction. The Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and, beginning in 2008, Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a large proportion of developmental licensed and or affiliated restaurants where we have royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars represent sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars increased $39 million or 1% (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008 and increased $372 million or 15% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007. After the Latam transaction in August 2007, there are no Company operated restaurants remaining in Latin America. Company operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 19 Table of Contents 2008. The refranchising strategy had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2008, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.

Europes Company operated margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In APMEA, the Company operated margin percent in 2008 and 2007 increased due to strong comparable sales in most markets. Both years were negatively impacted by higher labor costs and 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs. In Other Countries & Corporate, the Company operated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid April through July 2007. Supplemental information regarding Company operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to below as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded on the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted above, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. 20 Table of Contents U.S. Europe Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 As reported Number of Company operatedrestaurants at year end 1,782 2,090 2,104 2,024 2,177 2,253 Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 4,636 $ 4,682 $ 4,410 $ 7,424 $ 6,817 $ 5,885 Company operated margin $ 856 $ 876 $ 843 $ 1,340 $ 1,205 $ 960 Store operating margin Company operated margin $ 856 $ 876 $ 843 $ 1,340 $ 1,205 $ 960 Plus: Outside rent expense(1) 74 82 82 254 248 229 Depreciation buildings &leasehold improvements(1) 70 78 74 110 107 98 Less: Rent & royalties(2) (684 ) (691 ) (651 ) (1,435 ) (1,294 ) (1,099 ) Store operating margin $ 316 $ 345 $ 348 $ 269 $ 266 $ 188 Brand/real estate margin Rent & royalties(2) $ 684 $ 691 $ 651 $ 1,435 $ 1,294 $ 1,099 Less: Outside rent expense(1) (74 ) (82 ) (82 ) (254 ) (248 ) (229 ) Depreciation buildings &leasehold improvements(1) (70 ) (78 ) (74 ) (110 ) (107 ) (98 ) Brand/real estate margin $ 540 $ 531 $ 495 $ 1,071 $ 939 $ 772 (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy & other operating expenses on the Consolidated statement of income rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses were flat (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008 and increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2007. The 2008 constant currency change benefited by 3 percentage points due to the 2007 Latam transaction. In 2008, expenses included costs related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. In 2007, higher employee related costs were offset by a reduction in costs due to the Latam transaction.

In 2008, the charges primarily related to market restructuring costs in Greece. In 2007, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of pretax impairment charges primarily related to the Companys sale of its Latam businesses to a developmental licensee organization. In addition, the Company recorded a $16 million write off of assets associated with the Toasted Deli Sandwich products in Canada and a net gain of $14 million as a result of the transfer of the Companys ownership interest in three European markets to a developmental licensee, partly offset by a loss on the transfer of a small market in Europe to a developmental licensee. In 2006, the charges primarily related to losses of $36 million incurred on the transfers of the Companys ownership interest in certain markets, primarily in APMEA and Europe, to developmental licensees, costs of $35 million related to the closing of certain restaurants in the U.K. in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review, costs of $29 million to buy out certain litigating franchisees in Brazil, asset write offs and other charges in APMEA of $18 million, and a loss of $13 million related to the decision to dispose of supply chain operations in Russia.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2008 and 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company operated restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy in the Companys major markets. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets primarily Japan results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and are included in conventional franchised restaurant counts. Results in 2008 and 2007 reflected improved results from our Japanese affiliate. Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for store closings, contingencies and uncollectible receivables, and other miscellaneous expenses. Asset dispositions in 2008 reflected lower losses on restaurant closings and property disposals compared with 2007. In addition, 2008 results included income of $18 million due to the partial recovery of prior years sales taxes in the U.K. Results for 2006 reflected a gain of $26 million related to the sale of an office building in Russia. 22 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 U.S. $ 3,060 $ 2,842 $ 2,657 8 % 7 % 8 % 7 % Europe 2,608 2,125 1,610 23 32 17 21 APMEA 819 616 364 33 69 28 59 Other Countries & Corporate (44 ) (1,704 ) (198 ) 97 nm 97 nm Total $ 6,443 $ 3,879 $ 4,433 66 % (12 )% 62 % (18 )% Latam transaction (1,641 ) Total excluding Latam transaction* $ 6,443 $ 5,520 $ 4,433 17 % 25 % 14 % 19 % nm Not meaningful. * Results for 2007 included the impact of the Latam transaction in Other Countries & Corporate.

In order to provide managements view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. In the U.S., 2008 and 2007 results increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In 2007, operating income also included higher Company operated restaurant margin dollars compared with 2006. In Europe, results for 2008 and 2007 were driven by strong performance in France, Russia and the U.K. as well as positive results in Germany and most other markets. Impairment and other charges, net in 2006 benefited the growth rate in 2007. In APMEA, results for 2008 were driven by strong results in Australia and China, and positive performance in most other markets. Results for 2007 were driven by improved results in China, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and most other markets. Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 27.4%, 17.0% and 21.2%, respectively. Impairment and other charges negatively impacted the 2007 and 2006 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively. Interest expense Interest expense for 2008 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels, and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. Interest expense for 2007 increased primarily due to higher average interest rates and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels.

Translation and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and minority interest. Interest income decreased for 2008 primarily due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances, while 2007 decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances. Gain on Sale of Investment In second quarter 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K. based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million ($109 million after tax). Provision for income taxes In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the reported effective income tax rates were 30.0%, 34.6%, and 31.0%, respectively. In 2007, the effective income tax rate was impacted by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to the Latam impairment charge of $1,641 million. This benefit was minimal due to the Companys inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction in 2007. A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in 2008 and 2007. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Discontinued operations The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings in the first and second quarters and a tax free exchange for McDonalds common stock in the fourth quarter. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Markets and Chipotles results of operations and transaction gains are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 23 Table of Contents In connection with the Companys sale of its investment in Boston Market in August 2007, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Markets net income (loss) for 2007 and 2006 was ($9) million and $7 million, respectively. In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in a tax free gain to McDonalds of $32 million to reflect an increase in the carrying value of the Companys investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonalds sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61 million and an additional gain of $14 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonalds sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $267 million and a gain of $128 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company completely separated from Chipotle through a noncash, tax free exchange of its remaining Chipotle shares for its common stock. McDonalds accepted 18.6 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the 16.5 million shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonalds and recorded a tax free gain of $480 million. Chipotles net income for 2006 was $18 million. Accounting changes SFAS Statement No. 158 In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the Consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, as required. This resulted in a net decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $89 million, for a limited number of applicable international markets. EITF Issue 06 2 In 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). Under EITF 06 2, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. Previously, the Company expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. The Company adopted EITF 06 2 effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings is not significant. FASB Interpretation No. 48 In 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of FIN 48, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long term and included in other long term liabilities. SFAS Statement No. 157 In 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which allows entities to defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for one year, for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008 and elected the deferral for non financial assets and liabilities. The effect of adopting this standard was not significant, and we do not expect the January 1, 2009 adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non financial assets and liabilities to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS Statement No. 141(R) In 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values, changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from preacquisition contingencies, and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS Statement No. 160 In 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (ARB 51)) (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 becomes effective beginning January 1, 2009 and is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the reclassification of noncontrolling interests to equity and the recasting of net income (loss) attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests, which are required to be 24 Table of Contents adopted retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in 2008, while cash provided by operations totaled $4.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.9 billion in 2007. In 2008, cash provided by operations increased $1.0 billion or 21% compared to 2007 primarily due to increased operating results and changes in working capital, partly due to lower income tax payments and the receipt of $143 million related to an IRS examination completed in 2007. In 2007, cash provided by operations increased $535 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased operating results and lower income tax payments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of $475 million compared with 2007. Proceeds from certain asset sales were lower in 2008 (Pret A Manger) than 2007 (Latam and Boston Market). In addition, capital expenditures increased $189 million in 2008, primarily driven by increases in Europe and APMEA, partly offset by the elimination of capital expenditures as a result of the Latam transaction. The increase in cash used for investing activities was partly offset by higher proceeds from the sales of restaurant businesses and property and lower expenditures on purchases of restaurant businesses in conjunction with our overall refranchising strategy. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.2 billion in 2007, a decrease of $124 million compared with 2006, primarily due to net proceeds received from the Latam transaction and the sale of Boston Market in 2007, partly offset by higher capital expenditures. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.1 billion in 2008, an increase of $118 million compared with 2007. Financing activities in 2008 reflected lower proceeds from stock option exercises, mostly offset by higher net debt issuances. In 2007, cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion, a decrease of $1.5 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance increased $82 million in 2008 to $2.1 billion, compared with a decrease of $147 million in 2007. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2008, the Company opened 918 traditional restaurants and 77 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 209 traditional restaurants and 196 satellite restaurants. In 2007, the Company opened 743 traditional restaurants and 93 satellite restaurants, and closed 240 traditional restaurants and 265 satellite restaurants. About 60% of restaurant openings and more than 75% of restaurant closings occurred in the major markets in both years. Systemwide restaurants at year end(1) 2008 2007 2006 U.S. 13,918 13,862 13,774 Europe 6,628 6,480 6,403 APMEA 8,255 7,938 7,822 Other Countries & Corporate 3,166 3,097 3,047 Total 31,967 31,377 31,046 (1) Includes satellite units at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 as follows: U.S. 1,169, 1,233, 1,254; Europe226, 214, 201; APMEA (primarily Japan)1,379, 1,454, 1,640; Other Countries & Corporate447, 439, 417. In 2009, the Company expects to open about 950 traditional restaurants and 50 satellite restaurants and close about 200 traditional restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants. About 60% of total openings and 70% of total closings will be in major markets. Approximately 65% of Company operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2008. Franchisees operated 80% of the restaurants at year end 2008. Capital expenditures increased $189 million or 10% in 2008 and $205 million or 12% in 2007. The increases in capital expenditures in both years were primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants in Europe and APMEA in 2008 and in Europe and the U.S. in 2007. Capital expenditures reflected the Companys commitment to growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world in both years and the Combined Beverage Business in the U.S. in 2008. Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $10 million and $82 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expenditures in 2007 primarily related to investment in existing Boston Market restaurants and expenditures in 2006 primarily related to new Chipotle restaurants. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. Capital expenditures In millions 2008 2007 2006 New restaurants $ 897 $ 687 $ 530 Existing restaurants 1,152 1,158 1,075 Other(1) 87 102 137 Total capital expenditures $ 2,136 $ 1,947 $ 1,742 Total assets $ 28,462 $ 29,392 $ 28,974 (1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office related expenditures. New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.6 million in 2008. 25 Table of Contents The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year end 2008 and 2007. Share repurchases and dividends For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2008, the Company returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, bringing the two year total returned to shareholders for 2007 and 2008 to $11.5 billion. Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data 2008 2007 2006 Number of shares repurchased(1) 69.7 77.1 98.4 Shares outstanding at year end 1,115 1,165 1,204 Dividends declared per share $ 1.625 $ 1.50 $ 1.00 Dollar amount of shares repurchased(1) $ 3,981 $ 3,949 $ 3,719 Dividends paid 1,823 1,766 1,217 Total returned to shareholders $ 5,804 $ 5,715 $ 4,936 (1) 2006 included 18.6 million shares or $743.6 million acquired through the October 2006 Chipotle exchange. In September 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In 2007 and 2008 combined, approximately 147 million shares have been repurchased for $7.9 billion, of which 97 million shares or $5.6 billion were purchased under this program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 4% compared with 2007, net of stock option exercises. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 33 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The Companys Board of Directors decided that beginning in 2008, dividends declared will be paid on a quarterly basis, at the Boards discretion. The 2008 full year dividend of $1.625 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.375 per share, with an increase to $0.50 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 33% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.00 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets decreased $930 million or 3% in 2008. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $784 million in 2008 primarily due to capital expenditures. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year end 2008. Net property and equipment decreased $730 million in 2008 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $681 million. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2008 2007 2006 Return on average assets 21.8 % 13.2 % 15.0 % Return on average common equity 30.6 15.1 18.4 In 2008 and 2007, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S., Europe and APMEA. During 2009, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and invest new capital in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. Impairment and other charges reduced return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, impairment and other charges, partly offset by the 2007 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, reduced return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 1.9 percentage points, 1.3 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2008 totaled $10.2 billion, compared with $9.3 billion at December 31, 2007. The net increase in 2008 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.0 billion, partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $155 million.

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate exchange agreements. Fitch, Standard & Poors and Moodys currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Companys commercial paper F1, A 1 and P 2, respectively; and its long term debt A, A and A3, respectively. The Companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total 26 Table of Contents adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Companys balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $6 billion and $12 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 30% of Company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Companys estimate); capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2008, the Company has approximately $2.3 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) issuance of commercial paper; (iii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iv) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Euro Medium Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2009 is approximately $400 million of long term corporate debt and $230 million of outstanding commercial paper. In 2009, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt in order to refinance this maturing debt and potentially finance a portion of the Companys previously disclosed 2007 2009 expectation to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders. The Company also has $625 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year end. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. Although the recent instability in the financial markets has resulted in constraints on available credit, the Companys ability to raise funding in the long term and short term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected. In November 2008, the Company directly borrowed 40 billion Japanese Yen ($440 million) via a floating rate syndicated term loan maturing in 2014. In January 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 10 year U.S. Dollar denominated notes at a coupon rate of 5.0%, and $350 million of 30 year U.S. Dollar denominated bonds at a coupon rate of 5.7%. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. Derivatives were recorded at fair value on the Companys Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008 as follows: miscellaneous other assets$88 million; prepaid expenses and other current assets$44 million; accrued payroll and other liabilities$22 million; and other long term liabilities (excluding accrued interest)$4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Companys derivatives were recorded in miscellaneous other assets$64 million and other long term liabilities (excluding accrued interest)$70 million. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt was $4.5 billion and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2008, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2008 2007 Euro $ 4,551 $ 3,999 Australian Dollars 1,023 1,147 Canadian Dollars 795 929 British Pounds Sterling 785 634 Russian Ruble 407 463 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2008 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2008 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. 27 Table of Contents Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2008. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $108 million of SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $174 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the Companys qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $390 million at December 31, 2008 and were primarily included in other long term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. Also included in other long term liabilities at December 31, 2008 were gross unrecognized tax benefits of $272 million and liabilities for international retirement plans of $131 million. In connection with the Latam transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected in other long term liabilities on McDonalds Consolidated balance sheet totaling $142 million at year end 2008. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity: Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods. Share based compensation The Company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option, the risk free interest rate and expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Long lived assets impairment review Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are held for sale in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when 28 Table of Contents management and, if required, the Companys Board of Directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. An alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the 2007 Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two componentsthe cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. The Company bases its accounting policy on managements determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Companys 2005 2006 U.S. tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Companys 2003 2004 U.S. tax returns. The Companys 2007 U.S. tax return is currently under examination and the completion of the examination, which will ultimately include the 2008 U.S. tax return, is expected in 2011. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $6.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices inflation Although inflationary cost pressures increased globally in 2008, the Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, from the base period, adjusted for the impact of the Latam transaction in 2007. While the Company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. The denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle, Latam and Pret A Manger transactions. The weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2007 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2008 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 29 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year ROIIC are as follows: One year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 6,442.9 $ 3,879.0 $ 2,563.9 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,207.8 1,192.8 15.0 Latam transaction 1,665.3 (1,665.3 ) Currency translation(2) (180.7 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 732.9 DENOMINATOR: Weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $ 1,911.9 Currency translation(2) (25.9 ) Weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,886.0 One year ROIIC 38.9 % (1) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations.
