ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 32,737 restaurants in 117 countries at year end 2010, 26,338 were franchised or licensed (including 19,279 franchised to conventional franchisees, 3,485 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,574 licensed to foreign affiliates (affiliates) primarily Japan) and 6,399 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&eacute;cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20 year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries & Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 34%, 40% and 21% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, collectively, account for over 50% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonalds restaurant business as we believe significant opportunities remain for long term growth. Accordingly, in 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox) for total consideration of $140 million. In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K. based Pret A Manger for cash proceeds of $229 million. In connection with both sales, the Company recognized nonoperating gains. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. 10 Table of Contents Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success. This business model enables McDonalds to deliver consistent, locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences. McDonalds customer focused Plan to Win which concentrates on being better, not just bigger provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation. Through the execution of initiatives surrounding the five elements of our Plan to Win People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last seven years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders. We have exceeded our long term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plans implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long term benefit of our System. In 2010, we continued to enhance the customer experience by remaining focused on the Companys key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience including daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting Informal Eating Out (IEO) market in many countries. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2010 global comparable sales and guest counts, which increased 5.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Growth in comparable sales is driven by the Systems ability to optimize guest count growth, product mix shifts and menu price changes. Pricing actions reflect local market conditions, with a view to preserving and improving margins, while continuing to drive guest counts and market share gains. In general, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution of price and guest counts to comparable sales growth. In the U.S., we grew sales, guest counts, market share and restaurant cash flow, with comparable sales increasing for the 8th consecutive year, rising 3.8% in 2010. These positive results were achieved despite a declining IEO market. This performance was attributed to several factors including core menu items like Chicken McNuggets and burgers, everyday affordability and value options, such as the Breakfast Dollar Menu, additions to the McCaf&eacute; beverage line, new snack offerings and limited time offerings such as the McRib sandwich. The national launch of McCaf&eacute; frapp&eacute;s and real fruit smoothies provided a meaningful extension to the McCaf&eacute; line that was well received by customers. Extending the snack wrap line with the Angus Snack Wraps allowed customers to enjoy popular McDonalds burgers in a smaller, more portable fashion. Complementing these menu offerings were our convenient locations, efficient drive thru service and value oriented local beverage promotions. We broadened our accessibility through greater 24 hour operations and offered customers free Wi Fi in over 12,000 restaurants. Modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the extension of our interior and exterior reimaging program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants. In Europe, comparable sales rose 4.4%, marking the 7th consecutive year of comparable sales increases. Major contributors were France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. This performance reflected Europes strategic priorities of upgrading the customer and employee experience, increasing local relevance, and building brand transparency. Initiatives surrounding these platforms included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices, menu variety including limited time offerings, new dessert options, and reimaging almost 1,000 restaurants. We expanded our coffee business and have nearly 1,300 McCaf&eacute; locations, which in Europe generally represent a separate area inside the restaurant that serves specialty coffees, indulgent desserts and light snacks. The expansion of self order kiosks in France, Germany and Spain and the roll out of the new drive thru customer order display system in over 3,000 restaurants enhanced service. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended hours. We built upon the momentum of portable menu offerings with the introduction of McWraps larger sized beef and chicken wraps in Germany, and Ptit Plaisir offerings in France. Finally, we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonalds food and our sustainable business initiatives. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, led by Japan, Australia and China. Comparable sales rose 6.0% through strategies emphasizing value, core menu extensions, breakfast and convenience. Australia launched Family Dinner Boxes featuring popular menu items bundled together at a discounted price while China and Japan concentrated on affordability with Value Lunch platforms. New menu items such as a third Angus burger option in Australia and the extension of the Spicy Wings line in China were popular with consumers. Japan executed a successful U.S. themed burger promotion and a Chicken Festival promotion featuring several products. Our dessert strategy is introducing consumers to the McDonalds brand with products such as McFlurries and dessert kiosks in China, where we have become one of the largest retailers of ice cream. Our breakfast business continues to develop and is now offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. In Japan, value breakfast items, including the Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, were rotated across several months, while Australia launched new breakfast menu items. 11 Table of Contents Nearly two thirds of APMEA restaurants are now offering some form of extended hours and over 4,800 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now in approximately 1,600 restaurants, including nearly 400 in China. We continue to offer value to our customers by utilizing a strategic menu pricing tool that optimizes price, product mix, and promotions. This approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to execute our strategies successfully in every area of the world, grow comparable sales, leverage a low commodity cost environment and control selling, general & administrative expenses resulted in consolidated combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) of 31.0% in 2010, an improvement of 0.9 percentage points over 2009. In 2010, strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations, which rose $591 million to $6.3 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion were invested in our business primarily to open and reimage restaurants. Across the System, nearly 1,000 restaurants were opened and nearly 1,800 existing locations were reimaged. We returned $5.1 billion to shareholders consisting of $2.4 billion in dividends and nearly $2.7 billion in share repurchases. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators provides a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company owned model. We believe locally owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage, making McDonalds not just a global brand, but also a locally relevant one. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: Comparable sales grew 5.0% and guest counts rose 4.9%, building on 2009 increases of 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Revenues increased 6% (5% in constant currencies). Company operated margins improved to 19.6% and franchised margins improved to 82.4%. Operating income increased 9% (9% in constant currencies). Earnings per share was $4.58, an increase of 11%. Cash provided by operations increased $591 million to $6.3 billion. The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 11% to $0.61 for the fourth quarterbringing our current annual dividend rate to $2.44 per share. One year ROIIC was 37.3% and three year ROIIC was 38.3% for the period ended December 31, 2010 (see reconciliation on Page 25). The Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. OUTLOOK FOR 2011 We will continue to drive success in 2011 and beyond by enhancing customer relevance across all elements of our Plan to Win People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. Our global System continues to be energized by our ongoing momentum and significant growth opportunities. We continue to hold a strong competitive position in the market place, and we intend to further differentiate our brand by striving to become our customers favorite place and way to eat and drink. We will continue growing market share by executing our key strategies in the following areas: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening our accessibility. These efforts will include increasing menu choice, expanding destination beverages and desserts, enhancing our food image, accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers. We will execute these priorities to increase McDonalds brand relevance while continuing to practice operational and financial discipline. Consequently, we are confident we can again meet or exceed our long term constant currency financial targets. In the U.S., our 2011 focus will include highlighting core menu classics such as the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Chicken McNuggets, emphasizing the convenient and affordable food offered every day, and encouraging the trial of new products including Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and additional McCaf&eacute; beverage offerings. We will continue offering value across the menu through the Dollar Menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. Opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours and increasing restaurants that operate 24 hours per day will broaden accessibility to our customers. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology infrastructure with a new point of sale (POS) system, enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity, and contemporizing the interiors and exteriors of approximately 600 restaurants through reimaging. Our business in Europe will continue to be guided by three strategic priorities: increasing local relevance, upgrading the customer and employee experience, and building brand transparency. We will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of limited time food events as well as new snack and dessert options. In 2011, we will reimage approximately 850 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 90% of our interiors and over 50% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of 2012. Reimaging reinforces the quality of our brand while further differentiating us from the competition. We will leverage service innovations with the deployment of technologies such as the new POS system, self order kiosks, hand held order devices and drive thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help drive increased transactions and labor efficiency. We believe there is an opportunity to further build brand transparency by raising customer awareness about our food quality and product sourcing. In addition, we will communicate our efforts to preserve the environment through our sustainable business initiatives. Our European business in 2011 faces some headwinds from government initiated austerity measures being implemented in many countries. While we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures, we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth. In APMEA, we will continue our efforts to become our customers first choice for eating out by focusing on menu variety, value, restaurant experience and convenience. The markets will continue to execute against a combination of core menu 12 Table of Contents items, food events and limited time offerings to present a balanced mix of products to our customers. Value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers and build on our successful Value Lunch platforms. We will invest in our business primarily by opening over 600 new restaurants and reimaging over 500 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long term growth by increasing our base of restaurants by approximately 15% in 2011 toward our goal of nearly 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Convenience initiatives include expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours. McDonalds has an ongoing commitment to optimize our restaurant ownership structure. A heavily franchised, less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow, the amount of capital we invest and long term returns. We continue to maintain a strong culture of financial discipline by effectively managing all spending in order to maximize business performance. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to elevate the McDonalds experience by driving sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonalds does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2011 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 541 net traditional restaurants added in 2010. The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3 cents. With about 75% of McDonalds grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Companys commodity costs. For the full year 2011, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 2 2.5% in the U.S. and to increase 3.5 4.5% in Europe as compared to 2010. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. The Company expects full year 2011 selling, general & administrative expenses to decrease 2 3%, in constant currencies, partly due to higher incentive compensation in 2010 based on performance. In addition, fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2010, such as the Vancouver Winter Olympics in February and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April. Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2011 to increase approximately 7% compared with 2010. A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar, British Pound and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Companys operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Companys annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 20 cents. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2011 to be approximately 30% to 32%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2011 to be approximately $2.5 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,100 restaurants including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 750 traditional restaurants. The remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants. Over half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage approximately 2,200 locations worldwide, some of which will require no capital investment from the Company. 13 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Operating results 2010 2009 2008 Dollars in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/(decrease) Amount Increase/(decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 16,233 5 % $ 15,459 (7 )% $ 16,561 Revenues from franchised restaurants 7,842 8 7,286 5 6,961 Total revenues 24,075 6 22,745 (3 ) 23,522 Operating costs and expenses Company operated restaurant expenses 13,060 3 12,651 (7 ) 13,653 Franchised restaurants occupancy expenses 1,378 6 1,302 6 1,230 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,333 4 2,234 (5 ) 2,355 Impairment and other charges (credits), net 29 nm (61 ) nm 6 Other operating (income) expense, net (198 ) 11 (222 ) (35 ) (165 ) Total operating costs and expenses 16,602 4 15,904 (7 ) 17,079 Operating income 7,473 9 6,841 6 6,443 Interest expense 451 (5 ) 473 (9 ) 523 Nonoperating (income) expense, net 22 nm (24 ) 69 (78 ) Gain on sale of investment nm (95 ) 41 (160 ) Income before provision for income taxes 7,000 8 6,487 5 6,158 Provision for income taxes 2,054 6 1,936 5 1,845 Net income $ 4,946 9 % $ 4,551 6 % $ 4,313 Earnings per common share diluted $ 4.58 11 % $ 4.11 9 % $ 3.76 Weighted average common shares outstanding diluted 1,080.3 1,107.4 1,146.0 nm Not meaningful. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global curren cies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound.

Results for the year included after tax charges due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $25 million or $0.02 per share, primarily related to the Companys share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan (a 50% owned affiliate) in conjunction with the first quarter strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.01 per share on diluted earnings per share for the year. In 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.6 billion and $4.11. Results benefited by after tax income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $91 million or $0.08 per share, primarily due to the resolution of 14 Table of Contents certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Redbox, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million or $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. The Company repurchased 37.8 million shares of its stock for nearly $2.7 billion in 2010 and 50.3 million shares of its stock for $2.9 billion in 2009, driving reductions of over 2% and 3% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Over the past three years, the Company has continued to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. The shift to a greater percent age of franchised restaurants negatively impacted consolidated revenues as Company operated sales shifted to franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and or royalties based on a percent of sales. In 2010, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales. The impact of refranchising on consolidated revenues lessened because the number of Company operated restaurants sold to franchisees has declined compared with 2009 and 2008, in line with our overall strategy. In 2009, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion, partly offset by the impact of refranchising in certain of the Companys major markets.

New products introduced in 2010 included McCaf&eacute; frapp&eacute;s and smoothies as well as the Angus Snack Wraps, while new products introduced in 2009 included McCaf&eacute; premium coffees and the Angus Third Pounder. Refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in both years. Europes constant currency increases in revenues in 2010 and 2009 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia (which is entirely Company operated) as well as expansion in Russia. These increases were partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity, primarily in the U.K. in 2010 and the U.K. and Germany in 2009. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China, Australia and most other markets. The 2009 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Australia and most other Asian markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. 15 Table of Contents The following tables present comparable sales and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases): Comparable sales increases 2010 2009 2008 U.S. 3.8 % 2.6 % 4.0 % Europe 4.4 5.2 8.5 APMEA 6.0 3.4 9.0 Other Countries & Corporate 11.3 5.5 13.0 Total 5.0 % 3.8 % 6.9 % On a consolidated basis, comparable guest counts increased 4.9%, 1.4% and 3.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Franchised margin dollars represented about two thirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Franchised margin dollars increased $479 million or 8% (8% in constant currencies) in 2010 and $254 million or 4% (7% in constant currencies) in 2009. Positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in both years. Refranchising activity also contributed to the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010.

The 2009 decrease was due to additional depreciation primarily related to the Companys investment in the beverage initiative, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europes franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 and 2009 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses, the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2010 was primarily driven by foreign currency translation, mostly due to the stronger Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars represent sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars increased $366 million or 13% (12% in constant currencies) in 2010 and decreased $101 million or 3% (increased 3% in constant currencies) in 2009. Positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in Company operated margin dollars and percent in 2010. Positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity costs, drove growth in constant currency Company operated margin dollars and percent in 2009. In addition, refranchising activity negatively impacted Company operated margin dollars, but benefited Company operated margin percent in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010. 16 Table of Contents Company operated margins In millions 2010 2009 2008 U.S. $ 902 $ 832 $ 856 Europe 1,373 1,240 1,340 APMEA 764 624 584 Other Countries & Corporate 134 111 128 Total $ 3,173 $ 2,807 $ 2,908 Percent of sales U.S. 21.3 % 19.4 % 18.5 % Europe 19.8 18.4 18.0 APMEA 17.8 16.8 15.9 Other Countries & Corporate 17.2 15.2 15.3 Total 19.6 % 18.2 % 17.6 % In the U.S., the Company operated margin percent increased in 2010 due to lower commodity costs and positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by additional depreciation related to the beverage initiative and higher commodity costs. Refranchising had a positive impact on both periods. Europes Company operated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In 2009, local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs, primarily in Russia, and negatively impacted the Company operated margin percent. In APMEA, the Company operated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher occupancy & other costs and increased labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. Supplemental information regarding Company operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. 17 Table of Contents U.S. Europe Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 As reported Number of Company operated restaurants at year end 1,550 1,578 1,782 2,005 2,001 2,024 Sales by Company operated restaurants $ 4,229 $ 4,295 $ 4,636 $ 6,932 $ 6,721 $ 7,424 Company operated margin $ 902 $ 832 $ 856 $ 1,373 $ 1,240 $ 1,340 Store operating margin Company operated margin $ 902 $ 832 $ 856 $ 1,373 $ 1,240 $ 1,340 Plus: Outside rent expense(1) 60 65 74 223 222 254 Depreciation buildings & leasehold improvements(1) 65 70 70 105 100 110 Less: Rent & royalties(2) (619 ) (634 ) (684 ) (1,335 ) (1,306 ) (1,435 ) Store operating margin $ 408 $ 333 $ 316 $ 366 $ 256 $ 269 Brand/real estate margin Rent & royalties(2) $ 619 $ 634 $ 684 $ 1,335 $ 1,306 $ 1,435 Less: Outside rent expense(1) (60 ) (65 ) (74 ) (223 ) (222 ) (254 ) Depreciation buildings & leasehold improvements(1) (65 ) (70 ) (70 ) (105 ) (100 ) (110 ) Brand/real estate margin $ 494 $ 499 $ 540 $ 1,007 $ 984 $ 1,071 (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy & other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) in 2010 and decreased 5% (2% in constant currencies) in 2009. The Vancouver Winter Olympics in February and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April contributed to the increase in 2010. The 2009 expenses decreased partly due to costs in 2008 related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention.

Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 3.0% in 2010 compared with 3.1% in 2009 and 3.3% in 2008. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. 18 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NET The Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of $29 million in 2010, ($61) million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008.

In 2010, the Company recorded expense of $29 million primarily related to its share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan in conjunction with the first quarter strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. In 2009, the Company recorded income of $61 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense, net In millions 2010 2009 2008 Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (79 ) $ (113 ) $ (126 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (164 ) (168 ) (111 ) Asset dispositions and other expense 45 59 72 Total $ (198 ) $ (222 ) $ (165 ) Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who generally have options to purchase the businesses). The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2010 compared with 2009 and 2008 primarily as a result of selling less Company operated restaurants to franchisees. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets primarily Japan results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated affiliate restaurants worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in Japan. Results in 2009 also reflected improved operating performance in Japan and benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen. Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. 19 Table of Contents OPERATING INCOME Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 U.S. $ 3,446 $ 3,232 $ 3,060 7 % 6 % 7 % 6 % Europe 2,797 2,588 2,608 8 (1 ) 12 8 APMEA 1,200 989 819 21 21 11 23 Other Countries & Corporate 30 32 (44 ) (6 ) nm (43 ) nm Total $ 7,473 $ 6,841 $ 6,443 9 % 6 % 9 % 10 % nm Not meaningful. In the U.S., 2010 results increased due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars. Results for 2009 increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2010 and 2009 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, Russia and the U.K. In APMEA, 2010 results increased due to stronger results in Australia and many other markets. The Companys share of impairment charges related to restaurant closings in Japan negatively impacted the growth rate by 4 percentage points for the year. Results for 2009 were driven primarily by strong results in Australia and expansion in China. In Other Countries & Corporate, results for 2010 and 2009 included income of $21 million and $65 million, respectively, primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 31.0%, 30.1% and 27.4%, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits), net negatively impacted the combined operating margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2010, while positively impacting it by 0.3 percentage points in 2009. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower average interest rates slightly offset by higher average debt balances. Interest expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates, and to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by higher average debt levels.

Interest income decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates. Foreign currency and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and other nonoperating income and expenses. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $140 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax$59 million or $0.05 per share). In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K. based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million (after tax$109 million or $0.09 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.3%, 29.8% and 30.0%, respectively. In 2010, the effective income tax rate decreased due to higher tax benefits related to foreign operations. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair value measurements In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on fair value measurements, codified primarily in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial 20 Table of Contents statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. Variable interest entities and consolidation In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.2 billion in 2010, while cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in 2009. In 2010, cash provided by operations increased $591 million or 10% compared with 2009 primarily due to increased operating results. In 2009, cash provided by operations decreased $166 million or 3% compared with 2008 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments, higher noncash income items and the receipt of $143 million in 2008 related to the completion of an IRS examination. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $401 million compared with 2009. This reflects higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of investments and restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, an increase of $31 million compared with 2008. This reflects lower proceeds from sales of investments, restaurant businesses and property, offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily in the U.S. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $692 million compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, higher proceeds from stock option exercises and lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in the common stock dividend. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion in 2009, an increase of $307 million compared with 2008, primarily due to lower net debt issuances, an increase in the common stock dividend and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance increased $591 million in 2010 to $2.4 billion, compared with a decrease of $267 million in 2009. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2010, the Company opened 957 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 406 traditional restaurants and 327 satellite restaurants. Of these closures, there were over 400 in McDonalds Japan due to the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio. In 2009, the Company opened 824 traditional restaurants and 44 satellite restaurants and closed 215 traditional restaurants and 142 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Approximately 65% of Company operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2010. About 80% of the restaurants at year end 2010 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $183 million or 9% in 2010 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $184 million or 9% in 2009 primarily due to fewer restaurant openings, lower reinvestment in existing restaurants in the U.S. and the impact of foreign currency translation. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Companys commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 65% of the total in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.6 million in 2010. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year end 2010 and 2009. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2010, the Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid.

In 2009 and 2010 combined, approximately 45 million shares have been repurchased for $3.1 billion under this program. This program replaced the $10 billion share repurchase program that the Companys Board of Directors approved in September 2007. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 35 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2010 full year dividend of $2.26 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.55 per share, with an increase to $0.61 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 11% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.44 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.8 billion or 6% in 2010. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.7 billion in 2010. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year end 2010. Net property and equipment increased $529 million in 2010 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $719 million primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2010 2009 2008 Return on average assets 24.7 % 23.4 % 21.8 % Return on average common equity 35.3 34.0 30.6 In 2010, 2009 and 2008, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 1.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2010 totaled $11.5 billion, compared with $10.6 billion at December 31, 2009. The net increase in 2010 was primarily due to net issuances of $787 million and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $140 million.

Fitch, Standard & Poors and Moodys currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Companys commercial paper F1, A 1 and P 1, respectively; and its long term debt A, A and A2, respectively. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of 22 Table of Contents a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2010, the Company has $3 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Global Medium Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and Global market (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2011 is approximately $601 million of long term corporate debt. In 2011, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt to refinance this maturing debt. The Company also has $595 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year end 2010. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt was $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2010 2009 Euro $ 5,465 $ 5,151 Australian Dollars 2,075 1,460 Canadian Dollars 1,123 981 Russian Ruble 589 501 British Pounds Sterling 547 679 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2010 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2010 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. 23 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2010. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Contractual cash outflows Contractual cash inflows In millions Operatingleases Debtobligations(1) Minimum rent underfranchise arrangements 2011 $ 1,200 $ 8 $ 2,349 2012 1,116 2,212 2,289 2013 1,034 1,007 2,216 2014 926 708 2,120 2015 827 675 2,001 Thereafter 6,018 6,818 15,379 Total $ 11,121 $ 11,428 $ 26,354 (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short term obligations to long term obligations of $1.2 billion, as they are supported by a long term line of credit agreement expiring in March 2012. Debt obligations do not include $77 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $201 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $439 million. In addition, total liabilities for international retirement plans were $153 million and the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $573 million. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity: Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods. Share based compensation The Company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Long lived assets impairment review Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment 24 Table of Contents charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. As part of this exam, the Company resolved proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing matters that were previously received from the IRS. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this field examination was not significant. The Company continues to disagree with the IRS proposed adjustments related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company continues to believe that these adjustments are not justified, and intends to pursue all available remedies. The Company cannot predict with certainty the timing of resolution; however, the Company does not believe the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Companys 2005 and 2006 U.S. federal income tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. The IRS examination of the Companys 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns is expected to begin in 2011. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $11.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Latin America developmental license, Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2009 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2010 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 25 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year ROIIC are as follows (dollars in millions): One year ROIIC Calculation Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 7,473.1 $ 6,841.0 $ 632.1 Depreciation and amortization 1,276.2 1,216.2 60.0 Currency translation(1)  (22.2 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 669.9 DENOMINATOR: Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities(2) $ 1,821.1 Currency translation(1)  (26.5 ) Weightedaverage adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,794.6 One year ROIIC(3)  37.3 % (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.
