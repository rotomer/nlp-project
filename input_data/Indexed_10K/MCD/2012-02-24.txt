ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonalds restaurants. Of the 33,510 restaurants in 119 countries at year end 2011, 27,075 were franchised or licensed (including 19,527 franchised to conventional franchisees, 3,929 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,619 licensed to foreign affiliates (affiliates) primarily Japan) and 6,435 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&eacute;cor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20 year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present Other Countries & Corporate that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32%, 40% and 22% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, collectively, account for over 50% of Europes revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50% owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 55% of APMEAs revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Companys underlying business trends. Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Growth in comparable sales is driven by guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. McDonalds reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Companys financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities 10 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonalds success. This business model enables McDonalds to consistently deliver locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences. McDonalds customer focused Plan to Win which concentrates on being better, not just bigger provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five elements of our Plan to Win People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last eight years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders. We have exceeded our long term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plans implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long term benefit of our System. In 2011, we remained focused on customers needs and accelerated efforts within the Plan to Win where the greatest opportunity exists. The Companys key global priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our Brand represent areas where we are intensifying our efforts to drive the business further. Initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with consumers, driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment in many markets. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2011 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 5.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors, notably the food away from home and food at home inflation indices. In our Company operated restaurants, we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points, increase profitability and mitigate inflation, all while trying to maintain guest count momentum. In order to accomplish these objectives, we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price, product mix and promotion. Franchisees also have access to, and many utilize, this strategic pricing tool. In general, we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy. In 2011, we increased average price at Company operated restaurants in each area of the world, although increases varied by market and region. We look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry point value, core, premium and fourth tier offerings. We also introduce new products that meet customer needs, which can expand average check and increase guest counts. In the U.S., we grew sales, guest counts and market share with comparable sales up for the ninth consecutive year, rising 4.8% in 2011, while comparable guest counts rose 3.3%. These results were achieved despite a slight decline in the IEO segment. We remained focused on maximizing our core business while providing customers with affordable products and value throughout our menu including options available on the Dollar Menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. We highlighted core menu items like Chicken McNuggets that featured new sauces, breakfast products including our new Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, additions to the McCaf&eacute; beverage line and limited time offerings such as the McRib sandwich. The national launch of the McCaf&eacute; Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple real fruit smoothie provided meaningful extensions to the McCaf&eacute; beverage line. Convenient locations also continued to provide a competitive advantage with extended hours and efficient drive thru service. Modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the expansion of our major remodeling program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants and make our restaurants more relevant to our customers daily lives. Over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2011 with the majority adding drive thru capacity to capture additional guest counts. We also completed our two year, Systemwide roll out of a new point of sale system. This allows us to continue expanding our menu offerings while making it easier for our crew to fulfill every order accurately. In Europe, comparable sales rose 5.9%, marking the eighth consecutive year of comparable sales increases, and comparable guest counts rose 3.4%. Major contributors were the U.K., France, Russia and Germany. Initiatives that helped drive our business included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices, menu variety including new and limited time offerings, and reimaging over 900 restaurants. We continue to expand our coffee business and have over 1,500 McCaf&eacute; locations, which in Europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees, indulgent desserts and snacks. We completed the rollout of the new drive thru customer order display system in over 4,500 restaurants. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours. We offered new premium menu items such as the 1955 burger and expanded McWraps across several European markets. In many markets, we have continued to offer a fourth tier platform such as Little Tasters in the U.K. a range of tasty and appealing items in smaller portion sizes. Finally, we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonalds food and our commitment to sustainable business practices. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, led by China and Australia. Comparable sales rose 4.7% and comparable guest counts rose 4.3% with performance driven by strategies emphasizing value, breakfast, convenience, core menu extensions, desserts and promotional food events. Australia launched a Value Lunch program that features meals at discounted price points for certain hours while China and Japan concentrated on affordability by continuing their Value Lunch platforms. New menu items such as real fruit smoothies and frapp&eacute;s in Australia and the extension of the Value Breakfast program in China were popular with customers. Japan executed another successful U.S. themed burger promotion and celebrated its 40th anniversary by offering popular core menu items at reduced prices. Desserts McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 11 Table of Contents continue to play a meaningful role as we seek to deliver on customers menu expectations through products such as the McFlurry and unique delivery storefronts like the dessert kiosks in China, where we are now one of the largest ice cream retailers. Our breakfast business continues to evolve and is now offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. In Japan, rotational breakfast items, including the Chicken Muffin and Tuna Muffin, were offered during several months, while Australia launched new breakfast menu items such as bagel sandwiches. Nearly two thirds of APMEA restaurants are now offering some form of extended operating hours and over 4,600 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now available in over 1,500 restaurants, including nearly 500 in China. McDonalds Japan was negatively impacted by the natural disaster last March and as a result, continued to face some challenges throughout 2011. However, we remain confident that the market will continue to drive long term profitable growth. Our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to execute our strategies in every area of the world, grow comparable sales and control selling, general & administrative expenses resulted in combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) of 31.6% in 2011, an improvement of 0.6 percentage points over 2010. In 2011, strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations, which rose $808 million to $7.2 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion were invested in our business primarily to open new restaurants and reimage existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,150 restaurants were opened and over 2,500 existing locations were reimaged. In addition, we returned $6.0 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.4 billion in share repurchases and $2.6 billion in dividends. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company owned model. We believe locally owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages, making McDonalds not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: Comparable sales grew 5.6% and guest counts rose 3.7%, building on 2010 increases of 5.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Revenues increased 12% (8% in constant currencies). Operating income increased 14% (10% in constant currencies). Combined operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points to 31.6%. Diluted earnings per share was $5.27, an increase of 15% (11% in constant currencies). Cash provided by operations increased $808 million to $7.2 billion. One year ROIIC was 37.6% and three year ROIIC was 37.8% for the period ended December 31, 2011 (see reconciliation on page 25). The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 15% to $0.70 for the fourth quarter bringing our current annual dividend to $2.80 per share. The Company returned $6.0 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. OUTLOOK FOR 2012 We will continue to drive success in 2012 and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all elements of our Plan to Win. Our global System continues to be energized by our ongoing momentum and significant growth opportunities. We hold a strong competitive position in the market place, and we intend to further differentiate our brand by striving to become our customers favorite place and way to eat and drink. Growing market share will continue to be a focus as we execute our three global priorities: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening our accessibility. The menu efforts will include expanding destination beverages and desserts and enhancing our food image. The customer experience efforts will include accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and providing our restaurant teams with the appropriate tools, training, technology and staffing. The accessibility efforts will include increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers through greater proximity, extended operating hours and stronger value platforms. We will execute these priorities to increase McDonalds brand relevance with operational and financial discipline. Consequently, we are confident we can again meet or exceed our long term constant currency financial targets. In the U.S., our 2012 initiatives focus on balancing core menu classics with new products and promotional food events such as Chicken McBites, made with bite sized pieces of premium chicken breast, Blueberry Banana Nut Oatmeal, and additional McCaf&eacute; beverage offerings such as the Cherry Berry Chiller. We will continue offering value across the menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. Opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours during the breakfast and lunch day parts and increasing restaurants that operate 24 hours per day will allow us to broaden accessibility to our customers. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience include leveraging our new point of sale system with other technology enhancements such as using hand held order takers and advancements to improve our front counter service system. We also will expand our major remodel program to another 800 locations in 2012. Our business plans in Europe are focused on building market share with the right mix of guest counts, average check, strategic restaurant reimaging and expansion. We will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of promotional food events as well as new snack and dessert options. In 2012, we will reimage approximately 900 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 90% of our interiors and over 65% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of the year. We will leverage service innovations by continuing the deployment of technologies such as updating the point of sale system, self order kiosks and hand held order devices to enhance the customer experience and help drive increased transactions and 12 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents labor efficiency. We will also continue working to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools that enable us to use green energy in markets where available. In addition, the U.K. will be the proud host of our Olympic sponsorship, marking the ninth consecutive time that McDonalds will serve as the Official Restaurant of the Olympic Games. In 2012, our European business will continue to face headwinds due to economic uncertainty and additional government initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries. While we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures, we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth. In APMEA, we will continue our efforts to become our customers first choice for eating out by continuing to provide robust value platforms and focusing on menu variety, restaurant experience and convenience. Value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers across all dayparts, by building on our successful Value Lunch platforms and expanding our breakfast offerings. The markets will continue to execute against a combination of core menu items, promotional food events, desserts and limited time offerings to provide a balanced mix of products to our customers. We will grow our business by opening approximately 750 new restaurants and reimaging about 475 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long term growth by opening 225 to 250 restaurants in 2012 toward our goal of reaching 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Convenience initiatives will focus on expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours. We continue to maintain strong financial discipline by effectively managing spending in order to maximize financial performance. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonalds experience and drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonalds does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Companys results: Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2 percentage points to 2012 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to about 870 net traditional restaurants added in 2011. The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3 4 cents. With about 75% of McDonalds grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Companys commodity costs. For the full year 2012, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 4.5 5.5% in the U.S. and 2.5 3.5% in Europe, with more pressure expected in the first half. The Company expects full year 2012 selling, general & administrative expenses to increase about 6% in constant currencies, driven by certain technology investments, primarily to accelerate future restaurant capabilities, and costs related to the 2012 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and Olympics. The Company expects the magnitude of the increase to be confined to 2012. Fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to the timing of certain items such as the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and the Olympics. Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2012 to increase approximately 6 8% compared with 2011. A significant part of the Companys operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Companys operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Companys annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 24 cents. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2012 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. The Company expects capital expenditures for 2012 to be approximately $2.9 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open more than 1,300 restaurants including about 450 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 900 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants. Nearly half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage more than 2,400 locations worldwide, some of which will require no capital investment from the Company.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonalds mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar as well as most other currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily caused by the weaker Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.

Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 on diluted earnings per share. In 2010, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.9 billion and $4.58. Results included after tax charges due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $25 million or $0.02 per share, primarily related to the Companys share of restaurant closing costs in McDonalds Japan (a 50% owned affiliate) in conjunction with the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.01 per share on diluted earnings per share. In 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.6 billion and $4.11. Results benefited by after tax income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $91 million or $0.08 per share, primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Companys minority ownership interest in Redbox, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company repurchased 41.9 million shares of its stock for $3.4 billion in 2011 and 37.8 million shares of its stock for nearly $2.7 billion in 2010, driving reductions of over 3% and 2% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. REVENUES The Companys revenues consist of sales by Company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. In 2011 and 2010, constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion.

New products introduced in 2011 included Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and additions to the McCaf&eacute; beverage line, while new products introduced in 2010 included McCaf&eacute; frapp&eacute;s and smoothies as well as the Angus Snack Wraps. Refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in 2010. Europes constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Russia (which is entirely Company operated), the U.K., France and Germany, as well as expansion in Russia. The 2010 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia, as well as expansion in Russia, partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity primarily in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China and most other markets. The 2010 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China, Australia and most other markets. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years.

Franchised margin dollars represented about two thirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Franchised margin dollars increased $768 million or 12% (9% in constant currencies) in 2011 and $479 million or 8% (8% in constant currencies) in 2010. Positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchised margin dollars in both years.

In Europe, the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by 16 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents higher occupancy costs. Europes franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses, the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for Japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The 2010 decrease was primarily driven by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. Company operated margins Company operated margin dollars represent sales by Company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company operated margin dollars increased $282 million or 9% (5% in constant currencies) in 2011 and increased $366 million or 13% (12% in constant currencies) in 2010. The constant currency growth in Company operated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partially offset by higher costs, primarily commodity costs, in all segments. Positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in Company operated margin dollars in 2010.

The margin percent increased in 2010 due to lower commodity costs and positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. Refranchising also had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2010. Europes Company operated margin percent decreased in 2011 primarily due to higher commodity, labor, and occupancy costs, partially offset by positive comparable sales. The margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher labor costs. In APMEA, the Company operated margin percent in 2011 reflected positive comparable sales, offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the margin percent. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time. The APMEA margin percent increased in 2010 due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher occupancy & other costs and increased labor costs. Supplemental information regarding Company operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as Store operating margin. The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as Brand/real estate margin. Both Company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonalds investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonalds to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 17 Table of Contents generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company operated business. However, we believe that about $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is the typical cost to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

This adjustment is made to reflect expense in Store operating margin and income in Brand/real estate margin. Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2011 and increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) in 2010. The growth rate for 2011 was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentive based compensation and costs in 2010 related to the Vancouver Olympics and the Companys biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. The Olympics and Convention contributed to the increase in 2010.

In 2009, the Company recorded income of $61 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance.

The Companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of selling fewer Company operated restaurants to franchisees. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonalds share of results. For foreign affiliated markets primarily Japan results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonalds share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2011 reflected a benefit from stronger foreign currencies partly offset by the decline in the number of unconsolidated partnerships in the U.S. Results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated partnerships worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in Japan. Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense declined in 2011 primarily due to higher gains on unconsolidated partnership dissolutions in the U.S. OPERATING INCOME Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease)excluding currencytranslation Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2011 2010 U.S. $ 3,666 $ 3,446 $ 3,232 6 % 7 % 6 % 7 % Europe 3,227 2,797 2,588 15 8 10 12 APMEA 1,526 1,200 989 27 21 17 11 Other Countries & Corporate 111 30 32 nm (6 ) nm (43 ) Total $ 8,530 $ 7,473 $ 6,841 14 % 9 % 10 % 9 % nm Not meaningful. In the U.S., 2011 and 2010 results increased primarily due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2011 and 2010 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were driven by higher combined McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 19 Table of Contents restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars in 2011 and Company operated margin dollars in 2010. In APMEA, 2011 results increased due to stronger operating results in many markets. Results for 2010 were primarily driven by stronger results in Australia and many other markets. Impairment charges in 2010 positively impacted the constant currency growth rate for 2011 by 4 percentage points and negatively impacted the 2010 growth rate by 4 percentage points. Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 31.6%, 31.0% and 30.1%, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to higher average debt balances and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower average interest rates slightly offset by higher average debt balances.

Foreign currency and hedging activity includes net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of miscellaneous nonoperating income and expense items such as amortization of debt issuance costs. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $145 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax $59 million or $0.05 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.3%, 29.3% and 29.8%, respectively. In 2011, the effective income tax rate increased due to lower tax benefits related to certain foreign tax credits, partially offset by nonrecurring deferred tax benefits related to certain foreign operations. In 2010, the effective income tax rate decreased due to higher tax benefits related to foreign operations. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair value measurements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This update provides guidance on how fair value accounting should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards and does not extend the use of fair value accounting. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required, and does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to Topic 220 Comprehensive Income of the ASC. The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements and no longer permits the presentation of comprehensive income in the Consolidated statement of shareholders equity. The Company will adopt this new guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required. Variable interest entities and consolidation In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a companys involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $7.2 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.4 billion in 2011, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.2 billion in 2010. In 2011, cash provided by operations increased $808 million or 13% compared with 2010 primarily due to higher operating results. In 2010, cash provided by operations increased $591 million or 10% compared with 2009 primarily due to higher operating results. 20 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $515 million compared with 2010. This reflects higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $401 million compared with 2009. This reflects higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of investments and restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $804 million compared with 2010, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, an increase in the common stock dividend, and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by higher net debt issuances. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $692 million compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, higher proceeds from stock option exercises and lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Companys cash and equivalents balance decreased $51 million in 2011 to $2.3 billion, compared with an increase of $591 million in 2010. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2011, the Company opened 1,118 traditional restaurants and 32 satellite restaurants (small, limited menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 246 traditional restaurants and 131 satellite restaurants. In 2010, the Company opened 957 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants, and closed 406 traditional restaurants and 327 satellite restaurants. Of these closures, there were over 400 in McDonalds Japan due to the strategic review of the markets restaurant portfolio. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Approximately 65% of Company operated restaurants and over 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2011. Over 80% of the restaurants at year end 2011 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $595 million or 28% in 2011 primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures increased $183 million or 9% in 2010 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Companys commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 65% of the total in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonalds restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.7 million in 2011. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year end 2011 and 2010. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid.

In 2009, 2010 and 2011 combined, approximately 87 million shares have been repurchased for $6.5 billion under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 36 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2011 full year dividend of $2.53 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.61 per share, with an increase to $0.70 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 15% increase in the quarterly dividend McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 21 Table of Contents equates to a $2.80 per share annual dividend and reflects the Companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.0 billion or 3% in 2011. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.4 billion in 2011. Over 75% of total assets were in major markets at year end 2011. Net property and equipment increased $774 million in 2011 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $1.1 billion primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. 2011 2010 2009 Return on average assets 26.0 % 24.7 % 23.4 % Return on average common equity 37.7 35.3 34.0 In 2011, 2010, and 2009, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2011 totaled $12.5 billion, compared with $11.5 billion at December 31, 2010. The net increase in 2011 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.0 billion.

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps. Fitch, Standard & Poors and Moodys currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Companys commercial paper F1, A 1 and P 1, respectively; and its long term debt A, A and A2, respectively. Certain of the Companys debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Companys business. Under existing authorization from the Companys Board of Directors, at December 31, 2011, the Company had $1.7 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a Global Medium Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2012 is approximately $964 million of long term corporate debt. In 2012, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt to refinance this maturing debt. Consequently, in February 2012, the Company issued $250.0 million of 10 year U.S. Dollar denominated notes at a coupon rate of 2.625%, and $500.0 million of 30 year U.S. Dollar denominated notes at a coupon rate of 3.70%. The Company also has $640 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year end 2011. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over the counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt was $5.0 billion and $4.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Companys restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At 22 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents December 31, 2011, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Companys supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2011 2010 Euro $ 5,905 $ 5,465 Australian Dollars 2,409 2,075 Canadian Dollars 1,224 1,123 British Pounds Sterling 726 547 Russian Ruble 594 589 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2011 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2011 levels would materially affect the Companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2011. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Contractual cash outflows Contractual cash inflows In millions Operatingleases Debtobligations(1) Minimum rent underfranchise arrangements 2012 $ 1,247 $ 367 $ 2,425 2013 1,167 1,026 2,357 2014 1,075 738 2,273 2015 965 656 2,157 2016 852 2,158 2,037 Thereafter 6,248 7,499 15,949 Total $ 11,554 $ 12,444 $ 27,198 (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short term obligations to long term obligations of $1.5 billion, as they are supported by a long term line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016. Debt obligations do not include $56 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $218 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $482 million, and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $565 million. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Companys financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity: Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 23 Table of Contents similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods. Share based compensation The Company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk free interest rate, expected volatility of the Companys stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Companys stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Long lived assets impairment review Long lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys long lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Companys experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. Litigation accruals In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company disagrees with the IRS proposed adjustments. The Company has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office and expects resolution on this issue in 2012. The Company does not believe that the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. The Companys 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2013. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $12.6 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If managements intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Companys incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. 24 McDonalds Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents The denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarters investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2010 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2011 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year ROIIC are as follows: One year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 8,529.7 $ 7,473.1 $ 1,056.6 Depreciation and amortization 1,415.0 1,276.2 138.8 Currency translation(1) (331.4 ) Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 864.0 DENOMINATOR: Weighted average cash used for investing activities(2) $ 2,311.7 Currency translation(1) (11.3 ) Weighted average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 2,300.4 One year ROIIC(3) 37.6 % (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.
