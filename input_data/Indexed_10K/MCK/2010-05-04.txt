Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Companys fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Companys fiscal year. Certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements. See Item 1 Business Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct our business through two operating segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. See Financial Note 21, Segments of Business, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these segments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Years Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 108,702 $ 106,632 $ 101,703 Litigation Charge (Credit), Net (20 ) 493 (5 ) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes $ 1,864 $ 1,064 $ 1,457 Income Tax Expense (601 ) (241 ) (468 ) Income from Continuing Operations 1,263 823 989 Discontinued Operations, Net 1 Net Income $ 1,263 $ 823 $ 990 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Continuing Operations $ 4.62 $ 2.95 $ 3.32 Discontinued Operations Total $ 4.62 $ 2.95 $ 3.32 Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares 273 279 298 Revenues increased 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010 and 5% to $106.6 billion in 2009. The increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. To a lesser extent, revenues for 2010 were also affected by an increase in demand related to the flu season. These increases were partially offset by the loss of several customers in late 2009. Revenues for 2009 were increased by our acquisitions of Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) in October 2007 and McQueary Brothers Drug Company (McQueary Brothers) in May 2008. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 75% to $1.9 billion in 2010 and decreased 27% to $1.1 billion in 2009. The increase in 2010 was due to improved gross profit, lower operating expenses compared to 2009, which included the $493 million Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation charge discussed below, and increases in other income, partially offset by higher interest expense. The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2009 was due to higher operating expenses, primarily caused by the AWP litigation charge, and due to lower other income, partially offset by improved gross profit. 27 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit increased 6% to $5.7 billion and 7% to $5.4 billion in 2010 and 2009. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 18 basis points (bp) to 5.22% and 11 bp to 5.04% in 2010 and 2009. Gross profit margin increased in 2010 primarily reflecting an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. The increase in our 2009 gross profit margin was primarily due to an improvement in our Distribution Solutions segment margin, partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment margin. Operating expenses were $3.7 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating expenses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009, which included the AWP litigation charge as further discussed under the caption Operating Expenses in this Financial Review. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses for 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower Profit Sharing Investment Plan (PSIP) expense as more fully described under the caption Operating Expenses in this Financial Review, cost containment efforts, the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters in 2009 and the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Operating expenses for 2009 increased primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales growth, expenses associated with our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation. As noted above, operating expenses for 2009 included a pre tax charge of $493 million for the AWP litigation charge. In 2010, other income, net includes a $17 million pre tax gain ($14 million after tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions L.L.C. (MLS). In 2009, other income, net includes a pre tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after tax) on two equity held investments and a pre tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after tax) from the sale of an equity held investment. Over the last two years, other income, net was negatively affected by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and in 2009 was affected by a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance. Interest expense increased 30% to $187 million in 2010 and 1% to $144 million in 2009. Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long term notes in February 2009. Interest expense for 2009 reflects the repayment of $150 million of long term debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of $700 million of long term debt during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our reported income tax rates were 32.2%, 22.7% and 32.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which, $87 million represents a non cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition of these discrete items is primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations. Net income was $1,263 million, $823 million and $990 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.62, $2.95 and $3.32, which were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases from 2008 to 2010. 28 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revenues: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Distribution Solutions Direct distribution services $ 72,210 $ 66,876 $ 60,436 Sales to customers warehouses 21,435 25,809 27,668 Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution services 93,645 92,685 88,104 Canada pharmaceutical distribution services 9,072 8,225 8,106 Medical Surgical distribution services 2,861 2,658 2,509 Total Distribution Solutions 105,578 103,568 98,719 Technology Solutions Services 2,439 2,337 2,240 Software software systems 571 572 591 Hardware 114 155 153 Total Technology Solutions 3,124 3,064 2,984 Total Revenues $ 108,702 $ 106,632 $ 101,703 Total revenues increased 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010 and 5% to $106.6 billion in 2009. The growth in revenues was primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of revenues. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers warehouses to direct store delivery and market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers, offset in part by the greater sales of lower priced generic drugs. This increase was partially offset by the loss of several customers in late 2009. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting market growth, our acquisitions of OTN in October 2007 and McQueary Brothers in May 2008 and a shift of revenues from sales to customers warehouses to direct store delivery. Sales to customers warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to prior year primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, reduced revenues associated with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid 2009, partially offset by expanded business with existing customers. Sales to customers warehouses decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting a customers loss of business, the loss of a large customer and reduced revenues associated with the consolidation of certain customers. Additionally, 2009 revenues were also impacted by a shift to direct store delivery. These decreases were partially offset by expanded business with existing customers. Sales to retail customers warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct to store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost to serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars. 29 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The customer mix of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution revenues was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Direct Sales Independents 12 % 13 % 13 % Institutions 32 32 30 Retail Chains 32 26 24 Subtotal 76 71 67 Sales to retail customers warehouses 24 29 33 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % In 2010, the percentage of total direct and warehouse revenue attributed to the Companys retail chain customers compared to our other customer groups increased slightly from the same period a year ago, while it declined in 2009. In 2009, this decline resulted in a positive impact on the Companys gross profit margin. As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both the Companys direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost to serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate the Companys performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010 increased on a constant currency basis by 7% from prior year primarily due to market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers and a favorable foreign exchange rate of 3%. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2009 increased slightly primarily reflecting market growth, which was almost fully offset by 9% unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the loss of a customer. Medical Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season, acquisitions and increased volume from new and existing customers. Medical Surgical distribution and services revenues increased for 2009 from prior year primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions. In addition, revenues in 2008 were impacted by the discontinuance of the distribution of a product line. Revenues associated with this product line are now recorded by our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services business. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared to prior year due to higher services revenues primarily caused by increases in outsourcing revenues for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segments expanded customer base. These increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to increased services revenues primarily reflecting the segments expanded customer base and outsourcing revenues for claims processing. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a decrease in software revenues, particularly in the hospital and physician office customer channels. 30 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross Profit Distribution Solutions $ 4,219 $ 3,955 $ 3,586 Technology Solutions 1,457 1,423 1,423 Total $ 5,676 $ 5,378 $ 5,009 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions 4.00 % 3.82 % 3.63 % Technology Solutions 46.64 46.44 47.69 Total 5.22 5.04 4.93 Gross profit increased 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010 and 7% to $5.4 billion in 2009. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 18 bp in 2010 and 11 bp in 2009. Gross profit margin increased in 2010 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both of our operating segments. Our Distribution Solutions segment margin increased primarily due to flu related demand. Our Technology Solutions segment margin improved reflecting a change in revenue mix. In 2009, the increase in our Distribution Solutions gross profit margin was partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment reflecting a change in revenue mix and the recognition of $21 million of disease management deferred revenues in 2008 for which associated expenses were previously recognized as incurred. In 2010, our Distribution Solutions segments gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to the impact of the H1N1 flu virus, which helped drive an improved mix of higher margin revenues stemming from increased flu related demand across our distribution businesses. Gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy side margin, which primarily reflects compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin. Our last in, first out (LIFO) net inventory expense was $8 million for 2010 and 2009. In 2009, our Distribution Solutions segments gross profit margin increased compared to 2008. Gross profit margin was impacted by the benefit of increased sales of generic drugs with higher margins; higher buy side margins and an increase associated with a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to sales to customers warehouses, which generally have lower gross profit margins relative to other revenues within the segment. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in sell margin during the latter part of the year and LIFO net inventory credits ($8 million LIFO net expense in 2009 compared to a $14 million LIFO net credit in 2008). Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price related inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in this Financial Review. For each of the last three years, the Companys sales to customers warehouses represented 5% or less of the segments total gross profit dollars. In 2010, the percentage of total direct and warehouse revenue attributed to our retail chain customers compared to our other customer groups increased slightly from the same period a year ago, while it declined in 2009. In 2009, this decline resulted in a positive impact on the Companys gross profit margin. 31 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2010, our Technology Solutions segments gross profit margin was favorably affected by a change in revenue mix, partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate. In 2009, our Technology Solutions segments gross profit margin decreased compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a change in revenue mix and the recognition in 2008 of $21 million of disease management deferred revenues for which associated expenses were previously recognized as incurred. Operating Expenses: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions (1) $ 2,260 $ 2,777 $ 2,138 Technology Solutions 1,077 1,096 1,115 Corporate 351 309 283 Subtotal 3,688 4,182 3,536 Litigation (credit), net (20 ) (5 ) Total $ 3,668 $ 4,182 $ 3,531 Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions 2.14 % 2.68 % 2.17 % Technology Solutions 34.48 35.77 37.37 Total 3.37 3.92 3.47 (1) Operating expenses for 2009 include the $493 million AWP litigation charge. Operating expenses decreased 12% to $3.7 billion in 2010 and increased 18% to $4.2 billion in 2009. Operating expenses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009, which included the AWP litigation charge as more fully described below. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses for 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower PSIP expense as more fully described below, cost containment efforts, the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters in 2009 and the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses for 2009 increased primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales growth, expenses associated with our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation. The McKesson Corporation PSIP is a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119 million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class holding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately $77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the Unallocated Proceeds) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Companys common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP. Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Companys financial statements relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP. 32 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The Companys PSIP expense for the full year is negligible, as the Company did not make additional contributions to the PSIP or ESOP. As a result, our compensation expense in 2010 was lower than 2009. During 2009 and 2008, PSIP expense was $53 million and $13 million. The expense for 2008 was lower than 2009 due to the utilization of lower cost basis shares from the ESOP to fund our matching contributions. The expense for 2011 is expected to be approximately $58 million. PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Distribution Solutions $ $ 23 $ 5 Technology Solutions 1 28 7 Corporate 2 1 PSIP expense $ 1 $ 53 $ 13 Cost of sales (1) $ $ 12 $ 3 Operating expenses 1 41 10 PSIP expense $ 1 $ 53 $ 13 (1) Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our Technology Solutions segment. Over the last three years, we recorded the following reduction in workforce and restructuring charges: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Other workforce reduction charges, net (1) Distribution Solutions $ 9 $ 7 $ Technology Solutions 11 25 8 Total 20 32 8 Restructuring charges (credits), net Distribution Solutions (2) 1 4 8 Technology Solutions (3) (2 ) 9 Corporate 1 (1 ) 2 Total 2 1 19 Total reduction in workforce and restructuring charges $ 22 $ 33 $ 27 Cost of sales (4) $ 5 $ 5 $ 7 Operating expenses 17 28 20 Total reduction in workforce and restructuring charges $ 22 $ 33 $ 27 (1) Although other workforce reduction actions do not constitute a restructuring plan as defined under U.S. GAAP, they do represent independent actions taken from time to time, as appropriate. Other workforce reduction charges also reflected related facility exit costs of $4 million and $3 million in 2010 and 2009 for our Technology Solutions segment. (2) In 2008, we incurred $4 million of severance costs associated with the closure of two facilities and $1 million and $3 million of severance and asset impairments associated with the integration of OTN. (3) In 2008, we incurred $5 million of severance and exit related costs and a $4 million asset impairment charge for the write off of capitalized software costs associated with the termination of a software project. (4) Amounts recorded to cost of sales generally pertain to our Technology Solutions segment. 33 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) On a segment basis, Distribution Solutions operating expenses decreased in 2010 and increased in 2009 primarily due to the $493 million AWP litigation charge in 2009. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 primarily due to the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009, lower PSIP expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost containment, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our 2009 business acquisitions. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses in 2009 increased primarily due to business acquisitions and additional costs incurred to support our sales volume growth. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to the AWP litigation charge as well as additional costs incurred to support our sales volume growth. As discussed in Financial Note 18, Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims relating to First DataBank, Inc.s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for $350 million. We also recorded an accrual for pending and expected AWP related claims by public payors, which is currently estimated to be $143 million. The combination of the AWP settlement for all private party claims and the decision by us to establish an estimated accrual for the pending and expected AWP related claims by public payors resulted in a pre tax, non cash charge of $493 million in the third quarter of 2009. Technology Solutions segments operating expenses decreased over the past two years. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited from lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in 2009, partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities. Operating expenses for 2009 decreased primarily due to cost containment efforts and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in net research and development expenses and additional costs for business acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for this segment decreased for 2009 primarily reflecting the segments cost containment efforts and a more favorable business mix. Corporate expenses have increased over the last two years. Corporate expenses for 2010 increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs, other business initiatives and legal settlement charges, partially offset by the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual. Corporate expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting an increase in accounts receivable sales facility fees, compensation expense and additional costs incurred to support various initiatives. Other Income, net: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 By Segment Distribution Solutions $ 29 $ (20 ) $ 35 Technology Solutions 5 7 11 Corporate 9 25 75 Total $ 43 $ 12 $ 121 In 2010, other income, net includes a $17 million pre tax gain ($14 million after tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in MLS. The gain on sale of our investment in MLS was recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. The increase in other income, net was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates in 2010. Interest income, which is primarily recorded in Corporate, was $16 million, $31 million and $89 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009, other income, net included a pre tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after tax) on two equity held investments (as further described below) and a pre tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after tax) from the sale of our 42% equity interest in Verispan, LLC (Verispan). The impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in Verispan were both recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. Excluding these items, other income, net decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest income from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances and interest rates. 34 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an other than temporary decline in value. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that the fair value of our interest in Parata was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was other than temporary. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results and market capitalization rates. We determined the impairment was other than temporary based on our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investees financial condition and weak market conditions. As a result, we recorded a pre tax impairment of $58 million ($55 million after tax) on this investment which is recorded within other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Our investment in Parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting within our Distribution Solutions segment. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we also recorded a pre tax impairment of $5 million ($5 million after tax) on another equity held investment within our Distribution Solutions segment.

(2) Operating expenses for 2009 for our Distribution Solutions segment included the $493 million pre tax AWP litigation charge. (3) Other income, net for 2010 for our Distribution Solutions segment included the MLS pre tax gain of $17 million and for 2009 included $63 million of pre tax charges to write down two equity held investments and a $24 million pre tax gain on the sale of our equity investment in Verispan. In 2010, operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased primarily due to a higher gross profit margin, lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and the gain on sale of the segments 50% equity investment in MLS. Operating expenses improved due to the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009 and lower PSIP expense, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our business acquisitions. Results for 2009 included the $493 million AWP litigation charge, $63 million of pre tax charges to write down two equity held investments and a $24 million pre tax gain on the sale of the segments 42% equity investment in Verispan. In 2009, operating profit margin in our Distribution Solutions segment decreased compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues as a result of the AWP litigation charge and a decrease in other income, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. 35 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2010, operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased compared to 2009 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and an improvement in gross profit margin. In 2009, operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin. Operating profit margin for this segment for the past two years has benefited from cost containment efforts and a more favorable revenue mix. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest income. Corporate expenses, net of other income, increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in interest income and an increase in operating expenses. Litigation Credit, Net: In 2010 and 2008 we recorded net credits of $20 million and $5 million relating to settlements for the securities litigation. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long term notes in February 2009. Interest expense increased slightly in 2009 compared to the prior year, which reflects the repayment of $150 million of long term debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of $700 million of long term debt during the fourth quarter of 2009. Refer to our discussion under the caption Credit Resources within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. Income Taxes: Our reported tax rates were 32.2%, 22.7% and 32.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In 2009, we recorded a $182 million income tax benefit for the AWP litigation accrual. The tax benefit could change in the future depending on the resolution of the pending and expected claims. In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which $87 million represents a non cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations. In 2008, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began its examination of our fiscal years 2003 through 2006. In 2009 and 2010, we received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for a total of $62 million related to transfer pricing for 2003, 2004 and 2005. We paid the CRA assessments to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 and 2005. We believe we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results. In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all remaining income tax uncertainties. In 2008, the IRS completed an examination of our consolidated income tax returns for 2000 to 2002 resulting in a signed Revenue Agent Report (RAR), which was subsequently approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The IRS and the Company agreed to certain adjustments, primarily related to transfer pricing and income tax credits. As a result of the approved RAR, we recognized approximately $25 million of net federal and state income tax benefits in 2008. Discontinued Operations: No charges for discontinued operations were incurred during 2010 and 2009. In 2008, discontinued operations included $1 million from the Companys Acute Care business, which was sold in 2007. 36 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Net Income: Net income was $1,263 million, $823 million and $990 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.62, $2.95 and $3.32. The net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2009 included a pre tax charge of $493 million ($311 million after tax) for the AWP litigation as discussed in further detail under the caption Operating Expenses in this Financial Review. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 273 million, 279 million and 298 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The decrease in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding over the past two years primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares outstanding as a result of stock repurchased, partially offset by exercise of share based awards. International Operations International operations accounted for 8.6%, 7.9% and 8.2% of 2010, 2009 and 2008 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 21, Segments of Business, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations and Investments In 2009, we made the following acquisition: On May 21, 2008, we acquired McQueary Brothers of Springfield, Missouri for approximately $190 million. McQueary Brothers is a regional distributor of pharmaceutical, health and beauty products to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the Midwestern U.S. This acquisition expanded our existing U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. During the first quarter of 2010, the acquisition accounting was completed. Approximately $126 million of the purchase price allocation has been assigned to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits from synergies to be realized upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $61 million representing a customer relationship with a useful life of 7 years, a trade name of $2 million with a useful life of less than one year and a not to compete agreement of $4 million with a useful life of 4 years. Financial results for McQueary Brothers have been included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. In 2008, we made the following acquisition: On October 29, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of OTN of San Francisco, California for approximately $519 million, including the assumption of debt and net of $31 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired from OTN. During the third quarter of 2009, the acquisition accounting was completed. OTN is a U.S. distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals. The acquisition of OTN expanded our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Financial results for OTN are included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Approximately $240 million of the purchase price allocation has been assigned to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits from synergies upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $115 million representing customer relationships with a weighted average life of 9 years, developed technology of $3 million with a weighted average life of 4 years and trademarks and trade names of $10 million with a weighted average life of 5 years. 37 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions and investments within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and for certain recent acquisitions may be subject to change as we continue to evaluate and implement various restructuring initiatives. Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Note 2, Business Combinations and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussions regarding our acquisitions and investing activities. 2011 Outlook Information regarding the Companys 2011 outlook is contained in our Form 8 K dated May 3, 2010. This Form 8 K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 Business Forward looking Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. At March 31, 2010, revenues and accounts receivable from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of consolidated revenues and 45% of accounts receivable. At March 31, 2010, revenues and accounts receivable from our two largest customers, CVS and Rite Aid, represented approximately 15% and 12% of total consolidated revenues and 14% and 10% of accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 38 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2010 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue. At March 31, 2010, trade and notes receivables were $7,375 million prior to allowances of $131 million. In 2010, 2009 and 2008 our provision for bad debts was $17 million, $29 million and $41 million. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.8% and 2.2%. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2010 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on receivables of approximately $7 million. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (LCM). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion at March 31, 2010 and 2009. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 87% and 88% of our inventories at March 31, 2010 and 2009. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $93 million and $85 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical products. In 2010 and 2009, we recognized net LIFO expense of $8 million and in 2008, net LIFO credits of $14 million within our consolidated statements of operations. In 2010, our $8 million net LIFO expense related to our non pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., market). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or inventory as valued under FIFO. Primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $112 million and $107 million higher than FIFO as of March 31, 2010 and 2009. As a result, in 2010 and 2009, we recorded LCM charges of $5 million and $64 million within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. As deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues, we anticipate that LIFO credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset by LCM reserves. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow moving inventory by reviewing on hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, if indicated, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. 39 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Prior to April 1, 2009, amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development (IPRD) were expensed at the date of acquisition. Effective April 1, 2009, acquired IPRD is measured at fair value using market participant assumptions and initially capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset. Capitalized IPRD is amortized over its estimated useful life once the asset is put in service. Capitalized IPRD is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the assets carrying amount. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Effective April 1, 2009, contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period and changes to the fair value are included in the current periods earnings. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured subsequently. Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, Business Combinations and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $3,568 million and $3,528 million of goodwill at March 31, 2010 and 2009. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the Companys stock price and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. 40 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment, which would be recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Fair values can be determined using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2010 and 2009, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Supplier Incentives: Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, supplier reserves were $89 million and $113 million. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2010 and 2009 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. A hypothetical 0.1% percentage increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a percentage of trade payables would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $13 million in 2010. The ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our estimate. 41 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,187 million and $1,447 million at March 31, 2010 and 2009 and deferred tax liabilities of $1,845 million and $1,889 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $97 million against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $19 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for 2010. Share Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share based compensation. We account for all share based compensation transactions using a fair value based measurement method. The share based compensation expense is recognized, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight line basis. We estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes options pricing model. We believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience. 42 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. Such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates. Our assessments of estimated share based compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share based awards and the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the future share based compensation expense may differ from the Companys historical amounts. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. We record a provision for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, these decisions often involve a series of complex assessments by management about future events that can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions and it is possible that the actual cost of these matters could impact our earnings, either negatively or positively, in the period of their resolution. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long term and short term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time to time, we may access the long term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,316 million in 2010, compared to $1,351 million in 2009 and $869 million in 2008. Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the AWP litigation private payor settlement payments of $350 million. Cash flows from operations can also be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Operating activities for 2009 include a non cash charge of $493 million and the related income tax benefit of $182 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2009 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory (inventory, net of drafts and accounts payable). Operating activities for 2008 were affected by a use of cash of $962 million due to the release of restricted cash for our Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. In addition, operating activities in 2008 reflect changes in our working capital accounts due to revenue growth. 43 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $309 million in 2010 compared to $727 million in 2009 and $5 million in 2008. Investing activities for 2010 include $199 million and $179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP litigation settlement payments. Investing activities for 2009 included $358 million of cash payments for business acquisitions, including the McQueary Brothers acquisition for approximately $190 million. Investing activities for 2008 benefited from the $962 million release of restricted cash for our Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. Investing activities included $610 million in 2008 of cash paid for business acquisitions, including OTN. Financing activities utilized cash of $421 million in 2010, provided cash of $178 million in 2009 and utilized cash of $1,470 million in 2008. Financing activities for 2010 include $323 million in cash paid for share repurchases and $218 million in cash paid on our long term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010. Financing activities for 2009 include our February 2009 issuance of $350 million of 6.50% notes due 2014 and $350 million of 7.50% notes due 2019. Net proceeds of $693 million from the issuance of the notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. Financing activities for 2009 were also impacted by $502 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $116 million of dividends paid and $97 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2008 included $1.7 billion of cash paid for stock repurchases and $70 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $354 million of cash receipts from common stock issuances. The Companys Board has authorized the repurchase of McKessons common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. This authorization is described in more detail in Financial Note 19, Stockholders Equity, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased $299 million, $484 million and $1,686 million of its common stock at average prices of $41.47, $50.52 and $59.48. As of March 31, 2010, $531 million remained available for future repurchases under the outstanding April 2008 Board approved share repurchase plan. In April 2010, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the Companys common stock. In July 2008, the Board authorized the retirement of shares of the Companys common stock that may be repurchased from time to time pursuant to its stock repurchase program. During the second quarter of 2009, all of the 4 million repurchased shares, which we purchased for $204 million, were formally retired by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid in capital and retained earnings. As such, $165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, as evidenced by our debt issuance in February 2009, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. 44 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,731 $ 2,109 $ 1,362 Working capital 4,492 3,065 2,438 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (1,434 ) 403 435 Debt to capital ratio (1) 23.4 % 28.9 % 22.7 % Net debt to net capital employed (2) (23.5 )% 6.1 % 6.6 % Return on stockholders equity (3) 18.7 % 13.2 % 15.6 % (1) Ratio is computed as total debt divided by total debt and stockholders equity. (2) Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (net debt), divided by net debt and stockholders equity (net capital employed). (3) Ratio is computed as net income, divided by a five quarter average of stockholders equity. Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2010, included approximately $1.2 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. We may temporarily access cash held by foreign subsidiaries without subjecting us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax through intercompany loans. A notice issued by the IRS in January 2009 announced that the Treasury Department will, for a temporary period, extend the permitted duration of such intercompany loans that qualify for suspended deemed dividend treatment under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to the IRS notice, such intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent must be less than 60 days in duration and borrowing activities cannot exceed 180 cumulative days during the year. At March 31, 2010, there were no intercompany loans outstanding. The position set forth in the notice will apply for the Company until March 31, 2011. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of $215 million of our long term debt in March 2010. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2009, compared to March 31, 2008, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, partially offset by our $493 million AWP litigation accrual and a higher current portion of long term debt. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed decreased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of $215 million of our long term debt in March 2010. This ratio decreased at March 31, 2009, compared to March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by our issuance of $700 million of long term debt. The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common stock since the fourth quarter of 1999. In April 2008, the quarterly dividend was raised from six cents to twelve cents per share. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid total cash dividends of $131 million, $116 million and $70 million. 45 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Contractual Obligations: The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2010: Years (In millions) Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5 On balance sheet Long term debt (1) $ 2,296 $ 3 $ 919 $ 350 $ 1,024 Other (2) 300 22 48 128 102 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3) 879 149 258 156 316 Purchase obligations (4) 3,272 3,059 121 66 26 Customer guarantees (5) 146 64 25 6 51 Operating lease obligations (6) 363 106 140 67 50 Total $ 7,256 $ 3,403 $ 1,511 $ 773 $ 1,569 (1) Represents maturities of the Companys long term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. See Financial Note 12, Long Term Debt and Other Financing, for further information. (2) Represents our estimated benefit payments for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. (3) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long term debt obligations. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements. (5) Represents primarily agreements with certain of our customers financial institutions (primarily for our Canadian business) under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory at a discount in the event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions. Among other limitations, these inventories must be in resalable condition. The inventory repurchase agreements mostly range from one to two years. Customer guarantees range from one to five years and were primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers. The majority of our other customer guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer. At March 31, 2010, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer guarantees were $124 million and $17 million. We consider it unlikely that we would make significant payments under these guarantees and accordingly, no amounts had been accrued at March 31, 2010. Refer to Financial Note 17, Financial Guarantees and Warranties, for further information. (6) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases. See Financial Note 16, Lease Obligations, for further information. At March 31, 2010, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $514 million. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Company has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. In addition, at March 31, 2010, our banks and insurance companies have issued $111 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers compensation and automotive liability programs. 46 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Credit Resources: We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, our accounts receivable sales facility, short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper. Long Term Debt In March 2010, we repaid our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes, which had matured. On February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014, (the 2014 Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019, (the 2019 Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on August 15, 2009. The 2014 Notes will mature on February 15, 2014 and the 2019 Notes will mature on February 15, 2019. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes for general corporate purposes. Our senior debt credit ratings from SP, Fitch, and Moodys are currently A , BBB and Baa3, and our commercial paper ratings are currently A 2, F 2 and P 3. Our ratings outlook is stable with SP, Fitch, and Moodys. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2009, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility for an additional one year period under terms similar to those previously in place. The renewed facility will expire in mid May 2010. Based on our existing accounts receivable sales facility agreement, we anticipate that activity under this facility may, for U.S. GAAP purposes, be considered as a secured borrowing rather than a sale under accounting standards that will become effective for us on April 1, 2010. We anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. The aggregate commitment of the purchasers under this facility is $1.1 billion, although from time to time, the available amount may be less than that amount based on concentration limits and receivable eligibility requirements. Through this facility, McKesson Corporation, the parent company, sells certain U.S. pharmaceutical trade accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary, which then sells these receivables to a special purpose entity (SPE), which is a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary of McKesson Corporation that is consolidated in our financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to third party purchaser groups, each of which includes commercial paper conduits, which are special purpose legal entities administered by financial institutions. Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 12, Significant Accounting Policies and Long Term Debt and Other Financing, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revolving Credit Facility We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a Prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate. There were no borrowings under this facility in 2010 and $279 million for 2009. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. 47 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Commercial Paper We issued and repaid commercial paper of nil and approximately $3.3 billion and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. There were no commercial paper issuances outstanding at March 31, 2010 and 2009. Debt Covenant Our various borrowing facilities and long term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2010, this ratio was 23.4% and we were in compliance with our other financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 20, Related Party Balances and Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 48 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest rate risk: Our long term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by 50 bp in 2010, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2010, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $16 million. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $2,548 million and $2,545 million. The estimated fair value of our long term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel, Asia Pacific and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2010, an adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 49 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION
