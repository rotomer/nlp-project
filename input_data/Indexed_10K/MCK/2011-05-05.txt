Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Companys fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Companys fiscal year. Certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements. See Item 1 Business Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct our business through two operating segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. See Financial Note 20, Segments of Business, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of these segments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Years Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 112,084 $ 108,702 $ 106,632 Gross Profit 5,970 5,676 5,378 Operating Expenses (1) (4,149 ) (3,668 ) (4,182 ) Other Income, Net 36 43 12 Interest Expense (222 ) (187 ) (144 ) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 1,635 1,864 1,064 Income Tax Expense (505 ) (601 ) (241 ) Income from Continuing Operations 1,130 1,263 823 Discontinued Operation gain on sale, net of tax 72 Net Income $ 1,202 $ 1,263 $ 823 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Continuing Operations $ 4.29 $ 4.62 $ 2.95 Discontinued Operation 0.28 Total $ 4.57 $ 4.62 $ 2.95 Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares 263 273 279 (1) Includes pre tax litigation charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011 and 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010. The increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Additionally, revenues for 2011 benefited from our December 30, 2010 acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (US Oncology) of The Woodlands, Texas and revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand related to the flu season. Partially offsetting the 2010 increases, revenues for that year were affected by the loss of several customers in late 2009. 28 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit increased 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011 and 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 11 basis points (bp) to 5.33% and 18 bp to 5.22% in 2011 and 2010. The increase in our 2011 gross profit margin was primarily due to an increase in buy margin and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs in our Distribution Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment margin which included a $72 million asset impairment charge. The increase in our 2010 gross profit margin was primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses were $4.1 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating expenses include pre tax charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493 million relating to our securities and Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation matters. Excluding these charges (credit), operating expenses increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher employee compensation costs including expenses associated with our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (PSIP) as well as due to our acquisition of US Oncology. Excluding these charges (credit), operating expenses in 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower PSIP expenses and the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Our litigation charges (credit) and PSIP expense are more fully described under the caption Operating Expenses in this Financial Review. Other income, net was $36 million, $43 million and $12 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2009, other income, net included a pre tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after tax) on two equity held investments and a pre tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after tax) from the sale of an equity held investment. Interest expense increased 19% to $222 million in 2011 and 30% to $187 million in 2010. Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to bridge loan fees incurred for our acquisition of US Oncology and interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of $215 million of long term debt in March 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long term debt in February 2009. Our reported income tax rates were 30.9%, 32.2% and 22.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2011, income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which $87 million represents a non cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. Net income was $1,202 million, $1,263 million and $823 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, and diluted earnings per common share were $4.57, $4.62, and $2.95. Diluted earnings per common share were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years. Net income for 2011 includes a $72 million after tax gain (or $0.28 per diluted share) on the sale of our Technology Solutions segments wholly owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited (MAP), which was sold in July 2010. Historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material. 29 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revenues: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Distribution Solutions Direct distribution services $ 77,554 $ 72,210 $ 66,876 Sales to customers warehouses 18,631 21,435 25,809 Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution services 96,185 93,645 92,685 Canada pharmaceutical distribution services 9,784 9,072 8,225 Medical Surgical distribution services 2,920 2,861 2,658 Total Distribution Solutions 108,889 105,578 103,568 Technology Solutions Services 2,483 2,439 2,337 Software software systems 590 571 572 Hardware 122 114 155 Total Technology Solutions 3,195 3,124 3,064 Total Revenues $ 112,084 $ 108,702 $ 106,632 Revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011 and 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010. The increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers, the effect of a shift from sales to customers warehouses to direct store delivery, the lapsing of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and due to our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers warehouses to direct store delivery and market growth, partially offset by greater sales of lower priced generic drugs and the loss of several customers in late 2009. Revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand associated with the flu season. Sales to customers warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting reduced revenues associated with existing customers, the effect of a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, the lapsing of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and the impact of brand to generic conversions. Sales to customers warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, reduced revenues associated with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid 2009, partially offset by expanded business with existing customers. Sales to retail customers warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct to store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost to serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars. 30 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The customer mix of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution revenues was as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 2009 Direct Sales Independents 12 % 12 % 13 % Institutions 34 32 32 Retail Chains 33 32 26 Subtotal 79 76 71 Sales to retail customers warehouses 21 24 29 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost to serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 7%. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 1% in 2011. Canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth, offset by a government imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and brand to generic conversions. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to market growth and a favorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 3%. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased by 7% in 2010. Medical Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, partially offset by the decrease in demand associated with the flu season. Medical Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season, acquisitions and increased volume from new and existing customers. Technology Solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products and growth in our outsourcing services, partially offset by the sale of MAP in July 2010. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher services revenues associated with increases in outsourcing revenues for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segments expanded customer base. These increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher software revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales. 31 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1) $ 4,565 $ 4,219 $ 3,955 Technology Solutions (2) 1,405 1,457 1,423 Total $ 5,970 $ 5,676 $ 5,378 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions 4.19 % 4.00 % 3.82 % Technology Solutions 43.97 46.64 46.44 Total 5.33 5.22 5.04 (1) Gross profit of our Distribution Solutions segment for 2011 includes a credit of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. (2) Gross profit of our Technology Solutions segment for 2011 includes a $72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale. Gross profit increased 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011 and 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 11 bp in 2011 and 18 bp in 2010. Gross profit margin increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margin from our Distribution Solutions segment and increased in 2010 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both of our operating segments. In 2011, our Distribution Solutions segments gross profit margin increased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher buy margin, increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to our acquisition of US Oncology, partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and a decrease in sell margin. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our Distribution Solutions segments 2011 gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a credit of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit. In 2010, our Distribution Solutions segments gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues stemming from increased flu related demand across our distribution businesses. Gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy margin and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin. Our last in, first out (LIFO) net inventory expense was $3 million in 2011 and $8 million for 2010 and 2009. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segments distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price related inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in this Financial Review. 32 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2011, our Technology Solutions segments gross profit margin decreased compared to 2010 primarily due to a $72 million asset impairment charge, the sale of MAP and continued investment in our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products. These decreases were partially offset by a shift to higher margin revenue. In 2010, our Technology Solutions segments gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to a favorable change in revenue mix, partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate. Our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our Horizon Enterprise Revenue ManagementTM (HzERM) software product and as a result, concluded that the estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our Technology Solutions segments cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value. Operating Expenses: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions (1) $ 2,673 $ 2,260 $ 2,777 Technology Solutions 1,108 1,077 1,096 Corporate 368 351 309 Subtotal 4,149 3,688 4,182 Litigation (credit), net (20 ) Total $ 4,149 $ 3,668 $ 4,182 Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions 2.45 % 2.14 % 2.68 % Technology Solutions 34.68 34.48 35.77 Total 3.70 3.37 3.92 (1) Operating expenses for 2011 and 2009 include $213 million and $493 million of AWP litigation charges. Operating expenses increased 13% to $4.1 billion in 2011 and decreased 12% to $3.7 billion in 2010. Excluding the 2011, 2010 and 2009 litigation charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493 million, operating expenses increased 7% in 2011 and remained flat in 2010. Excluding the litigation charges (credit), operating expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including the McKesson Corporation Profit Sharing Investment Plan (PSIP) and the addition of US Oncology. Excluding the litigation charges (credit), operating expenses for 2010 approximated 2009 primarily due to lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and the sale of two businesses during 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. The McKesson Corporation PSIP was a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119 million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class holding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately $77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the Unallocated Proceeds) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Companys common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP. 33 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Companys financial statements relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP. As a result of the PSIPs receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds, in 2010 the Company contributed $1 million to the PSIP. Accordingly, PSIP expense for 2010 was nominal. In 2011, the Company resumed its contributions to the PSIP. PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Distribution Solutions $ 23 $ $ 23 Technology Solutions 32 1 28 Corporate 4 2 PSIP expense $ 59 $ 1 $ 53 Cost of sales (1) $ 17 $ $ 12 Operating expenses 42 1 41 PSIP expense $ 59 $ 1 $ 53 (1) Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our McKesson Technology Solutions segment. On a segment basis, Distribution Solutions segments operating expenses increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010 primarily due to the AWP litigation charges of $213 million and $493 million in 2011 and 2009. Excluding the AWP charge, operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including PSIP expenses and the addition of US Oncology. Operating expenses in 2011 also increased as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the AWP charge, Distribution Solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the sale of two businesses during 2009, lower PSIP expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost containment. These decreases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with our 2009 business acquisitions. As previously reported, in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims relating to First DataBank, Inc.s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for $350 million. We also recorded an accrual of $143 million for pending and expected AWP claims by public payers. The combination of the settlement for all AWP private party claims and the decision by us to establish an estimated accrual for the pending and expected AWP claims by public payers resulted in a pre tax, non cash charge of $493 million in the third quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a pre tax charge of $24 million for the settlement with the State of Connecticut relating to AWP claims. The settlement included an express denial of liability and a release by Connecticut of the Company as to all matters alleged or which could have been alleged in the action. A cash payment of $26 million was made in the third quarter of 2011 for this settlement. During the third quarter of 2011, following a review of the reserve for estimated probable losses from current and possible future public entity AWP claims, which review included consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions during and after the third quarter relating to state and federal Medicaid claims, we recorded a pre tax charge of $189 million. All AWP litigation charges were included in our Distribution Solutions segments operating expenses. As of March 31, 2011, the reserve relating to AWP public entity claims was $330 million and was included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 17, Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information. 34 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) As a result of our acquisition of US Oncology, we incurred a net $52 million of acquisition related expenses as follows: Corporate Distribution Interest (In millions) Solutions Expense Total Operating expenses: Transaction closing expenses $ 22 $ $ 22 Severance and relocation 9 9 Other integration expenses 10 2 12 Total operating expenses 41 2 43 Other income: reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense from former shareholders (16 ) (16 ) Interest expense: bridge loan fees 25 25 Total acquisition related expenses $ 41 $ 11 $ 52 We anticipate incurring additional acquisition related expenses in 2012 as we continue to integrate US Oncology. Technology Solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010. The growth in 2011 reflects our increased investment in research and development activities and higher employee compensation and benefit costs, which includes PSIP expense, partially offset by the sale of MAP in the second quarter of 2011. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited from lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in 2009, partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities. Corporate expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs and an asset impairment charge for certain tangible property, partially offset by lower fees associated with our accounts receivable facility. As a result of our adoption of a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets on April 1, 2010, fees associated with our accounts receivable sales facility are now recorded in interest expense. Prior to 2011, these fees were recorded in Corporate administrative expenses. Corporate expenses for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs, other business initiatives and legal settlement charges. In 2010, we recorded net credits of $20 million relating to settlements for the securities litigation, which were recorded in Corporate expenses. Other Income, net: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 By Segment Distribution Solutions $ 5 $ 29 $ (20 ) Technology Solutions 4 5 7 Corporate 27 9 25 Total $ 36 $ 43 $ 12 In 2011, other income, net included a credit of $16 million representing the reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology, which is recorded in Corporate. Interest income was $18 million, $16 million and $31 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2010, other income, net included a $17 million pre tax gain ($14 million after tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions, LLC (MLS). The gain on sale of our investment in MLS was recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates. 35 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2009, other income, net included a pre tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after tax) on two equity held investments (as further described below) and a pre tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after tax) from the sale of our 42% equity interest in Verispan, LLC (Verispan). The impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in Verispan were both recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an other than temporary decline in value. In 2009, we determined that the fair value of our interest in Parata Systems, LLC (Parata) was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was other than temporary. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results and market capitalization rates. We determined the impairment was other than temporary based on our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investees financial condition and weak market conditions. As a result, we recorded a pre tax impairment of $58 million ($55 million after tax) on this investment which is recorded as other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. Our investment in Parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In 2009, we also recorded a pre tax impairment of $5 million ($5 million after tax) on another equity held investment within our Distribution Solutions segment.

(2) Operating expenses for 2011 and 2009 for our Distribution Solutions segment included $213 million and $493 million of AWP litigation charges. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, including a $213 million AWP litigation charge, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin, which included a $51 million antitrust settlement. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a higher gross profit margin, lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and higher other income. Results for 2010 included the $17 million gain on sale of MLS. Results for 2009 included the $493 million AWP litigation charge, $63 million of charges to write down two equity held investments and a $24 million gain on the sale of the segments 42% equity investment in Verispan. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit margin, which included the $72 million asset impairment charge and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and an improvement in gross profit margin. 36 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Corporate expenses, net of other income were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses which were fully offset by an increase in other income, including the $16 million benefit associated with the reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest income. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25 million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of US Oncology, interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt and fees from our accounts receivable sales facility which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $215 million of our long term debt in March 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long term debt in February 2009. Refer to our discussion under the caption Credit Resources within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. Income Taxes: Our reported tax rates were 30.9%, 32.2% and 22.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In 2011, income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. In 2009, income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which $87 million represents a non cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently examining our fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and we anticipate the field work will be completed and they will issue the Revenue Agent Report in our first quarter of fiscal 2012. We have received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for a total of $169 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007. If we are not successful in resolving these issues with the CRA, a trial date has been set for October 17, 2011 with the Tax Court of Canada. We believe that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to the IRS and CRA examinations. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense. Discontinued Operation: In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold MAP, a provider of phone and web based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109 million. The divestiture generated a pre tax and after tax gain of $95 million and $72 million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million. The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after tax gain on the divestiture. The after tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Net Income: Net income was $1,202 million, $1,263 million and $823 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.57, $4.62 and $2.95. The net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 included a pre tax charge of $213 million ($149 million after tax). Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an after tax gain of $72 million (or $0.28 per diluted share) relating to our sale of MAP. The net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2009 included a pre tax charge of $493 million ($311 million after tax) for the AWP litigation. 37 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 263 million, 273 million and 279 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding over the past two years primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares outstanding as a result of stock repurchased, partially offset by the exercise/settlement of share based awards. International Operations International operations accounted for 8.9%, 8.6% and 7.9% of 2011, 2010 and 2009 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 20, Segments of Business, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Combinations On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology for approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $1.9 billion. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with community based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $1.0 billion, which primarily consist of $0.7 billion of service agreements and $0.2 billion of customer lists. The estimated weighted average lives of the service agreements, customer lists and total acquired intangibles are 18 years, 10 years and 16 years. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $808 million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. Due to the recent timing of the acquisition, the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized. Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. On May 21, 2008, we acquired McQueary Brothers of Springfield, Missouri for approximately $190 million. McQueary Brothers is a regional distributor of pharmaceutical, health and beauty products to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the Midwestern U.S. This acquisition expanded our existing U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Financial results for McQueary Brothers have been included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. During the first quarter of 2010, the fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were completed. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $126 million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflected the expected future benefits from synergies to be realized upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation were acquired identifiable intangibles of $61 million primarily representing a customer relationship with a useful life of 7 years, a trade name of $2 million with a useful life of less than one year and a not to compete agreement of $4 million with a useful life of 4 years. During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. 38 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 11, Business Combinations and Debt and Financing Activities, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. 2012 Outlook Information regarding the Companys 2012 outlook is contained in our Form 8 K dated May 3, 2011. This Form 8 K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 Business Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 39 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (CVS) and Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid), accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2011, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 43% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal Mart Stores, Inc. (Walmart) and Rite Aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2011 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue. At March 31, 2011, trade and notes receivables were $8,108 million prior to allowances of $124 million. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 our provision for bad debts was $18 million, $17 million and $29 million. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.5% and 1.8%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2011 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $8 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 40 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (LCM). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion at March 31, 2011 and 2010. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 87% of our inventories at March 31, 2011 and 2010. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $96 million and $93 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical products. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized net LIFO expense of $3 million, $8 million and $8 million within our consolidated statements of operations. In 2011, our $3 million net LIFO expense related to our non pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., market). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or inventory as valued under FIFO. Primarily due to continued net deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $156 million and $112 million higher than FIFO as of March 31, 2011 and 2010. As a result, in 2011 and 2010, we recorded LCM charges of $44 million and $5 million within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. As deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues, we anticipate that LIFO credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset by LCM reserves. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow moving inventory by reviewing on hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, if indicated, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Effective April 1, 2009, acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related expenses totaled $52 million in 2011 and were not material in 2010. Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. 41 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $4,364 million and $3,568 million of goodwill at March 31, 2011 and 2010. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the Companys stock price and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. Impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment, which would be recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Fair values can be determined using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Supplier Incentives: Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. 42 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, supplier reserves were $102 million and $89 million. The ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2011 and 2010 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2011 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $14 million in 2011. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,297 million and $1,187 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010 and deferred tax liabilities of $2,261 million and $1,845 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $99 million against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $16 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for 2011. Share Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share based compensation. We account for all share based compensation transactions using a fair value based measurement method. The share based compensation expense is recognized, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight line basis. 43 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) We estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes options pricing model. We believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience. In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. Such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates. Our assessments of estimated share based compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share based awards and the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the future share based compensation expense may differ from the Companys historical amounts. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long term and short term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time to time, we may access the long term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. 44 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,338 million in 2011 compared to $2,316 million in 2010 and $1,351 million in 2009. Operating activities for 2011 included a non cash charge of $213 million and the related income tax benefit of $64 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2011 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth, partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases. Cash flows from operations can also be significantly affected by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the AWP litigation private payer settlement payments of $350 million. Operating activities for 2009 included a non cash charge of $493 million and the related income tax benefit of $182 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2009 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory (inventory, net of drafts and accounts payable). Net cash used in investing activities was $624 million in 2011 compared to $309 million in 2010 and $727 million in 2009. Investing activities for 2011 included $292 million of cash payments for business acquisitions, including approximately $244 million for our acquisition of US Oncology, and $109 million of cash received from the sale of MAP. Investing activities in 2011 also included $233 million and $155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2010 included $199 million and $179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP private litigation settlement payments. Investing activities for 2009 included $358 million of cash payments for business acquisitions, including the McQueary Brothers acquisition for approximately $190 million. Financing activities utilized cash of $1,841 million in 2011 and $421 million in 2010, and provided cash of $178 million in 2009. Financing activities for 2011 reflect $1,689 million of cash received from the issuance of long term debt. In February 2011 we issued $600 million of 3.25% notes due 2016, $600 million of 4.75% notes due 2021, and $500 million of 6.00% notes due 2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of the long term notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used to pay off the $1,730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of US Oncology. Also as part of our acquisition of US Oncology, we borrowed $1,000 million for bridge financing which was fully repaid by February 2011. Financing activities for 2011 also included $2,050 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $171 million of dividends paid and $367 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2010 included $323 million in cash paid for share repurchases and $218 million in cash paid on our long term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010. Financing activities for 2010 also included $323 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $131 million of dividends paid and $212 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2009 included our February 2009 issuance of $350 million of 6.50% notes due 2014 and $350 million of 7.50% notes due 2019. Net proceeds of $693 million from the issuance of the notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. Financing activities for 2009 also included $502 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $116 million of dividends paid and $97 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. The Companys Board has authorized the repurchase of McKessons common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. As of March 31, 2011, $500 million remained available for future repurchases under the October 2010 Board approved share repurchase plan. In April 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the Companys common stock. 45 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In July 2008, the Board authorized the retirement of shares of the Companys common stock that may be repurchased from time to time pursuant to its stock repurchase program. During the second quarter of 2009, all of the 4 million repurchased shares, which we purchased for $204 million, were formally retired by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid in capital and retained earnings. As such, $165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

(2) Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (net debt), divided by net debt and stockholders equity (net capital employed). (3) Ratio is computed as net income, divided by a five quarter average of stockholders equity. Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2011, included approximately $1.8 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. During the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to IRS regulations, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. The duration of this temporary loan to the United States was less than 60 days. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payables, accrued liabilities and the current portion of long term debt, partially offset by an increase in receivables. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2010 compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of $215 million of our long term debt in March 2010. 46 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2011, compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in total debt as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. This ratio decreased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of $215 million of our long term debt in March 2010. The Company paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common stock from the fourth quarter of 1999 through the fourth quarter of 2008. In April 2008, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.06 to $0.12 per share and in May 2010, the quarterly dividend was raised to $0.18 per common share. In April 2011, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share, applicable to ensuing quarterly dividend declarations. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid total cash dividends of $171 million, $131 million and $116 million. Contractual Obligations: The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2011: Years (In millions) Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5 On balance sheet Long term debt (1) $ 4,004 $ 417 $ 861 $ 606 $ 2,120 Other (2) 413 32 83 162 136 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3) 2,012 224 361 293 1,134 Purchase obligations (4) 3,730 3,610 89 31 Operating lease obligations (5) 844 178 258 167 241 Customer guarantees (6) 176 119 24 5 28 Total $ 11,179 $ 4,580 $ 1,676 $ 1,264 $ 3,659 (1) Represents maturities of the Companys long term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. (2) Represents our estimated benefit payments for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. (3) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long term debt obligations. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements. (5) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases. (6) Represents primarily agreements with certain of our Canadian customers financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers inventory or our customers debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. We also have an agreement with one software customer that, under limited circumstances, may require us to secure standby financing. Because the amount of the standby financing is not explicitly stated, the overall amount of this guarantee cannot reasonably be estimated. At March 31, 2011, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and customers debt guarantees were $138 million and $38 million, none of which had been accrued. At March 31, 2011, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $485 million. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. 47 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In addition, at March 31, 2011, our banks and insurance companies have issued $128 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers compensation and automotive liability programs. Credit Resources: We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, our accounts receivable sales facility, short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper. Senior Bridge Term Loan Facility In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010, we entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (Bridge Loan). In December 2010, we reduced the Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the funds obtained under the Bridge Loan with long term debt, as further described below, and the Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the Bridge Loan bore interest of 1.76%, which was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Companys credit rating. Bridge Loan fees of $25 million were included in Corporate interest expense. US Oncology Debt Acquired Upon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012, and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including the remaining accrued interest, for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our Bridge Loan. Long Term Debt On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, 4.75% notes due March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and 6.00% notes due March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2011. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the Bridge Loan. On February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014, in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019, in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes. In March 2010, we repaid our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes, which had matured. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2010, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility (the Facility) for an additional one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place, and in doing so we increased our committed balance from $1.1 billion to $1.35 billion. From time to time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. The renewed Facility will expire in May 2011. We anticipate renewing this Facility before its expiration. At March 31, 2011, there were no securitized accounts receivable balances or secured borrowings outstanding under the Facility. As of March 31, 2010, there were no accounts receivable sold under the Facility. Additionally, there were no sales of interests to third party purchaser groups in the year ended March 31, 2011. 48 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 11, Significant Accounting Policies and Debt and Financing Activities, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revolving Credit Facility We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a Prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate. There were no borrowings under this facility in 2011 and 2010 and $279 million for 2009. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. Commercial Paper There were no commercial paper issuances during 2011 and 2010 and no amount outstanding at March 31, 2011 and 2010. We issued and repaid $3.3 billion of commercial paper in 2009. Debt Covenant Our various borrowing facilities and long term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2011, this ratio was 35.7% and we were in compliance with our other financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 19, Related Party Balances and Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest rate risk: Our long term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2011, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2011, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $17 million. The selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.3 billion and $2.5 billion. The estimated fair value of our long term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2011, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 50 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION
