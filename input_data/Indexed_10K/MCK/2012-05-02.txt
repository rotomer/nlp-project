This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Companys fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Companys fiscal year. Certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements. See Item 1 Business Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct our business through two operating segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions. See Financial Note 22, Segments of Business, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of these segments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Revenues $ 122,734 $ 112,084 $ 108,702 10% 3% Gross Profit $ 6,567 $ 5,970 $ 5,676 10% 5% Operating Expenses 4,269 3,936 3,688 8 7 Litigation Charges (Credit), Net 149 213 (20) (30) Total Operating Expenses 4,418 4,149 3,668 6 13 Other Income, Net 21 36 43 (42) (16) Interest Expense (251) (222) (187) 13 19 Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 1,919 1,635 1,864 17 (12) Income Tax Expense (516) (505) (601) 2 (16) Income from Continuing Operations 1,403 1,130 1,263 24 (11) Discontinued Operation gain on sale, net of tax 72 Net Income $ 1,403 $ 1,202 $ 1,263 17 (5) Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Continuing Operations $ 5.59 $ 4.29 $ 4.62 30% (7)% Discontinued Operation 0.28 Total $ 5.59 $ 4.57 $ 4.62 22 (1) Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares 251 263 273 (5)% (4)% Revenues increased over each of the last two years primarily reflecting market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Additionally, revenues for 2012 and 2011 benefited from our December 30, 2010 acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (US Oncology). 28 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit and gross profit margin increased over each of the last two years. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 2 basis points (bp) to 5.35% in 2012 and 11 bp to 5.33% in 2011. Gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the addition of US Oncology, higher generics income in our Distribution Solutions segment and an increase in higher margin revenues in our Technology Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sell margin and by a $51 million benefit in 2011 associated with the receipt of our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer in our Distribution Solutions segment. Gross profit margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in buy margin, higher generics income and the receipt of $51 million from an antitrust class action settlement in our Distribution Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment margin, which included a $72 million asset impairment charge. Operating expenses increased over each of the last two years primarily reflecting an increase in expenses associated with supporting our higher revenues, the addition of US Oncology, and higher employee compensation and benefits costs, which includes expenses associated with our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (PSIP). Operating expenses were also impacted by Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation charges of $149 million and $213 million in 2012 and 2011. Our litigation charges and PSIP expense are more fully described under the caption Operating Expenses in this Financial Review. Other income, net was $21 million, $36 million and $43 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2011, other income, net includes the receipt of $16 million representing the reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology. In 2010, other income, net includes a $17 million pre tax gain ($14 million after tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions, LLC (MLS). Interest expense increased over each of the last two years primarily due to the assumption of US Oncologys debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt, which includes $25 million of bridge loan financing fees incurred in 2011. Additionally, 2011 interest expense benefited from repayment of $215 million of long term debt in March 2010. Our reported income tax rates were 26.9%, 30.9% and 32.2% in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In addition, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, income tax expense includes $66 million, $34 million and $7 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit, is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our AWP litigation. Net income was $1,403 million, $1,202 million and $1,263 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, and diluted earnings per common share were $5.59, $4.57 and $4.62. Net income for 2012 and 2011 includes after tax AWP litigation charges of $60 million and $149 million. Additionally, net income for 2011 includes a $72 million after tax gain (or $0.28 per diluted share) on the sale of our Technology Solutions segments wholly owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited (MAP), which was sold in July 2010. Historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material. Diluted earnings per common share were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding decreased over each of the last two years due to our share repurchases. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we repurchased 20 million, 29 million and 8 million of our common shares. 29 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Distribution Solutions Direct distribution & services $ 85,523 $ 77,554 $ 72,210 10% 7% Sales to customers warehouses 20,453 18,631 21,435 10 (13) Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution & services 105,976 96,185 93,645 10 3 Canada pharmaceutical distribution & services 10,303 9,784 9,072 5 8 Medical Surgical distribution & services 3,145 2,920 2,861 8 2 Total Distribution Solutions 119,424 108,889 105,578 10 3 Technology Solutions Services 2,594 2,483 2,439 4 2 Software & software systems 596 590 571 1 3 Hardware 120 122 114 (2) 7 Total Technology Solutions 3,310 3,195 3,124 4 2 Total Revenues $ 122,734 $ 112,084 $ 108,702 10 3 Revenues increased 10% to $122.7 billion in 2012 and 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011. The increase in revenues in each year primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues, and our acquisition of US Oncology. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth, which includes growing drug utilization and price increases, and from our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, the effect of a shift of revenues from sales to customers warehouses to direct store delivery, the lapping of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and due to our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Sales to customers warehouses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to a new customer and new business with existing customers. Sales to customers warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting reduced revenues associated with existing customers, the effect of a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, the lapping of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Sales to retail customers warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct to store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost to serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars. 30 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The customer mix of revenues from our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business was as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011 2010 Direct Sales Retail Chains 34% 33% 32% Institutions 34 34 32 Independents 11 12 12 Subtotal 79 79 76 Sales to retail customers warehouses 21 21 24 Total 100% 100% 100% As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost to serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011. Excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 2% during 2012, revenues increased primarily due to market growth, five additional sales days and a small acquisition in the second quarter of 2011, partially offset by government imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 8% in 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 7% during 2011, revenues increased 1% in 2011. Canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth, offset by a government imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Medical Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth, new customers and five additional sales days. Medical Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, partially offset by a decrease in demand associated with the flu season. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher revenues for claims processing, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products, an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers and a number of small acquisitions made during 2012. Technology Solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products and higher revenues for claims processing, partially offset by the sale of MAP in July 2010. Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1) $ 5,057 $ 4,565 $ 4,219 11% 8% Technology Solutions (2) 1,510 1,405 1,457 7 (4) Total $ 6,567 $ 5,970 $ 5,676 10 5 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions 4.23% 4.19% 4.00% 4bp 19bp Technology Solutions 45.62 43.97 46.64 165 (267) Total 5.35 5.33 5.22 2 11 (1) Gross profit of our Distribution Solutions segment for 2011 includes a credit of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. (2) Gross profit of our Technology Solutions segment for 2012 and 2011 includes a $31 million product alignment charge and a $72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale. 31 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit increased 10% to $6.6 billion in 2012 and 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 2 bp in 2012 and by 11 bp in 2011. Gross profit margin increased in 2012 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margins from both of our operating segments and increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margin from our Distribution Solutions segment. Distribution Solutions segments gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of US Oncology and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs, partially offset by a decline in sell margin and the receipt of $51 million in 2011 representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Distribution Solutions segments gross profit margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher buy margin, increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to our acquisition of US Oncology, partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and a decrease in sell margin. Our Distribution Solutions segments 2011 gross profit margin was also favorably affected by the receipt of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our last in, first out (LIFO) net inventory expense was $11 million in 2012, $3 million in 2011 and $8 million for 2010. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segments distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price related inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years. During 2012, we experienced a decline in deflationary trends in generic pharmaceuticals as a result of a reduction in generic product launches as compared to the prior year. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in this Financial Review. Technology Solutions segments gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in higher margin revenues, a $72 million asset impairment charge related to our Horizon Enterprise ManagementTM (HzERM) software product in 2011 and lower amortization expense related to HzERM. These increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of $31 million in 2012. Technology Solutions segments gross profit margin decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a $72 million asset impairment charge related to HzERM, the sale of MAP and continued investment in our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products, partially offset by a shift to higher margin revenue. During the third quarter of 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our Technology Solutions segment. As part of this alignment strategy, we will be converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragons Microsoft&reg;based platform over time. Additionally, we have stopped development of our HzERM software product. The plan resulted in a pre tax charge of $51 million in 2012, of which $31 million was recorded to cost of sales and $20 million was recorded to operating expenses within our Technology Solutions segment. The majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012. The pre tax charge includes $24 million of non cash asset impairment charges, primarily for the write off of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward, $10 million for severance, $7 million for customer allowances and $10 million for other charges. 32 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, our HzERM software product became generally available. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our HzERM software product and, as a result, concluded that the estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our Technology Solutions segments cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value. Operating Expenses: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions (1) $ 2,854 $ 2,673 $ 2,260 7% 18% Technology Solutions 1,151 1,108 1,077 4 3 Corporate 413 368 351 12% 5 Subtotal 4,418 4,149 3,688 6 13 Litigation Credit, Net (20) Total $ 4,418 $ 4,149 $ 3,668 6 13 Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions 2.39% 2.45% 2.14% (6)bp 31bp Technology Solutions 34.77 34.68 34.48 9 20 Total 3.60 3.70 3.37 (10) 33 (1) Operating expenses for 2012 and 2011 include $149 million and $213 million of AWP litigation charges. Operating expenses increased 6% to $4.4 billion in 2012 and 13% to $4.1 billion in 2011. Operating expenses include pre tax charges of $149 million and $213 million in 2012 and 2011 relating to our AWP litigation and a pre tax credit of $20 million in 2010 relating to our securities litigation matter. Operating expenses increased in 2012 primarily due to the addition of US Oncology, higher employee compensation and benefits costs and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues, partially offset by a lower AWP litigation charge. Operating expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to the AWP litigation charge, higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits, including our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (PSIP), and the acquisition of US Oncology. The McKesson Corporation PSIP was a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119 million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class holding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately $77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the Unallocated Proceeds) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Companys common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP. Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Companys financial statements relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP. As a result of the PSIPs receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds, in 2010 the Company contributed $1 million to the PSIP. Accordingly, PSIP expense for 2010 was nominal. Commencing in 2011, the Company resumed its contributions to the PSIP. 33 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Distribution Solutions $ 22 $ 23 $ Technology Solutions 30 32 1 Corporate 6 4 PSIP expense $ 58 $ 59 $ 1 Cost of sales (1) $ 17 $ 17 $ Operating expenses 41 42 1 PSIP expense $ 58 $ 59 $ 1 (1) Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our McKesson Technology Solutions segment. Acquisition related expenses were primarily incurred in 2012 and 2011 to acquire and integrate US Oncology. Acquisition related expenses are generally recorded within operating expenses. In 2011, we incurred $25 million of bridge loan fees in connection with our acquisition of US Oncology, which were accounted as interest expense in Corporate, and we received reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense from former shareholders of US Oncology of $16 million, which was accounted as other income. Acquisition related expenses were as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Operating Expenses: Distribution Solutions $ 24 $ 41 $ Technology Solutions 6 Corporate 1 2 Total 31 43 Other Income: reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense from former US Oncology shareholders (16) Interest Expense: bridge loan fees 25 Total Acquisition related Expenses $ 31 $ 52 $ Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions (acquisition related amortization) increased by $59 million to $191 million in 2012 and by $11 million to $132 million in 2011 compared to same periods a year ago. The increases were primarily due to our acquisition of US Oncology. Acquisition related amortization was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Cost of Sales: Distribution Solutions $ 1 $ $ 1 Technology Solutions 19 16 20 Total 20 16 21 Operating Expenses: Distribution Solutions 120 70 53 Technology Solutions 51 46 47 Total 171 116 100 Total Acquisition related Amortization $ 191 $ 132 $ 121 34 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Distribution Solutions segments operating expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting the addition of US Oncology, higher employee compensation and benefits expenses and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues, partially offset by a lower AWP litigation charge. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to operating leverage, partially offset by the addition of US Oncology. Distribution Solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the AWP litigation charge of $213 million in 2011, higher employee compensation and benefits expenses, including PSIP expenses, the addition of US Oncology and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims. Pre tax charges relating to changes in the Companys AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, are recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment. The Companys AWP litigation reserve is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In view of the number of outstanding cases and expected future claims, and the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve. The following is the activity related to the AWP litigation reserve for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 AWP litigation reserve at beginning of period $ 330 $ 143 $ 143 Charges incurred 149 213 Payments made (26) (26) AWP litigation reserve at end of period $ 453 $ 330 $ 143 The charges for 2012 primarily related to the Douglas County, Kansas Action settlement and the state and federal Medicaid claims. The charges for 2011 primarily related to state and federal Medicaid claims. On April 3, 2012, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve the federal share of Medicaid claims related to AWP. The total settlement amount of $191 million, which includes interest, was paid on April 9, 2012. Refer to Financial Note 19, Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information. Technology Solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to continued investment in research and development activities, a number of small acquisitions in 2012 and a charge of $20 million for a product alignment plan. These increases were partially offset by cost containment efforts. Technology Solutions segments operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to our increased investment in research and development activities and higher employee compensation and benefit costs, which includes PSIP expense, partially offset by the sale of MAP in the second quarter of 2011. Corporate expenses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits expenses and a charitable contribution. Corporate expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs and an asset impairment charge for certain tangible property. These increases were partially offset by lower fees associated with our accounts receivable facility. As a result of our adoption of a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets on April 1, 2010, fees associated with our accounts receivable sales facility are recorded in interest expense. Prior to 2011, these fees were recorded in Corporate administrative expenses. 35 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Other Income, Net: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Other Income, Net Distribution Solutions $ 16 $ 5 $ 29 220% (83)% Technology Solutions 5 4 5 25 (20) Corporate 27 9 (100) 200 Total $ 21 $ 36 $ 43 (42) (16) In 2011, other income, net included the receipt of $16 million representing the reimbursement of post acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology, which is recorded in Corporate.

Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher gross profit margin, which included a full year of results from US Oncology, and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included a lower AWP litigation charge. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, including a $213 million AWP litigation charge, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin, which included the receipt of $51 million representing our share of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit margin, which included the $72 million asset impairment charge, and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. 36 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in other income. Corporate expenses, net of other income were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, which were offset by an increase in other income. Litigation Credit, Net: In 2010, we recorded a net credit of $20 million relating to settlements for a securities litigation. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the $1.7 billion of long term debt issued in February 2011 in connection with our acquisition of US Oncology. Interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25 million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of US Oncology, interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt, and fees from our accounts receivable sales facility, which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $215 million of our long term debt in March 2010. Refer to our discussion under the caption Credit Resources within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. Income Taxes: Our reported income tax rates were 26.9%, 30.9% and 32.2% in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In addition, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, income tax expense included $66 million, $34 million and $7 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit, is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our AWP litigation. We have received tax assessments of $98 million from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to 2003 through 2006. We disagree with a substantial portion of the tax assessments primarily relating to transfer pricing. We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process and an opening conference has been scheduled for May 15, 2012. We have received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for a total of $169 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007. The trial between McKesson Canada Corporation and the CRA, argued in the Tax Court of Canada, concluded in early February 2012, and we are waiting for the decision. We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense. Discontinued Operation: In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold its wholly owned subsidiary, MAP, a provider of phone and web based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109 million. The divestiture generated a pre tax and after tax gain of $95 million and $72 million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million. The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after tax gain on the divestiture. The after tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Net Income: Net income was $1,403 million, $1,202 million and $1,263 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010 and diluted earnings per common share were $5.59, $4.57 and $4.62. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2012 and 2011 include after tax AWP litigation charges of $60 million and $149 million, or $0.24 and $0.57 per diluted common share. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include an after tax securities litigation credit of $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an after tax gain of $72 million, or $0.28 per diluted share relating to our sale of MAP. 37 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 251 million, 263 million and 273 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010. The decreases in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding primarily reflect the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years, partially offset by the exercise and settlement of share based awards. International Operations International operations accounted for 8.6%, 8.9% and 8.6% of 2012, 2011 and 2010 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 22, Segments of Business, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Combinations On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology for approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $1.9 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with community based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. On March 25, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. (Katz Group), and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group (collectively, Katz Assets) for approximately $919 million, net of cash acquired. The total purchase price is subject to change due to working capital adjustments within 60 days of closing. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of more than 850 independently owned pharmacies in Canada. The acquisition of Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to more than 160 independent pharmacies in Canada. Financial results for this acquisition were not included in the results of operations for 2012 as they were not material. These results will be included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013. In April 2012, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, for total cash of $90 million. The cash paid was funded from cash on hand. We previously held a 50% ownership interest and are the primary tenant in this building. This transaction will be accounted for as a step acquisition, which requires that we re measure our previously held 50% interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re measurement to fair value is anticipated to result in a pre tax gain of approximately $75 million ($46 million after tax). The pre tax gain will be recorded within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the quarter ending June 30, 2012. During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. 38 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 12, Business Combinations and Debt and Financing Activities, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. 2013 Outlook Information regarding the Companys 2013 outlook is contained in our Form 8 K dated April 30, 2012. This Form 8 K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 Business Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 39 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2012, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (CVS) and Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid), accounted for approximately 16% and 10% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2012, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 49% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal Mart Stores, Inc. (Walmart) and Rite Aid were approximately 17%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2012 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue. At March 31, 2012, trade and notes receivables were $8,735 million prior to allowances of $111 million. In 2012, 2011 and 2010 our provision for bad debts was $30 million, $18 million and $17 million. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.3% and 1.5%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2012 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $9 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 40 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (LCM). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $10.1 billion and $9.2 billion at March 31, 2012 and 2011. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 88% and 87% of our inventories at March 31, 2012 and 2011. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $107 million and $96 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical products. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized net LIFO expense of $11 million, $3 million and $8 million within our consolidated statements of operations, which related to our non pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average cost or FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., market). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Primarily due to continued net deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $76 million and $156 million higher than market as of March 31, 2012 and 2011. As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of $80 million in 2012 and a LCM charge of $44 million in 2011 within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. During 2012, we experienced a decline in deflationary trends in generic pharmaceuticals as a result of a reduction in generic product launches as compared to the prior year. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow moving inventory by reviewing on hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories, which are considered excess and obsolete, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. 41 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $5,032 million and $4,364 million of goodwill at March 31, 2012 and 2011. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Companys stock price and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. Impairment tests require that we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform a quantitative assessment, the fair values can be determined using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Supplier Incentives: Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. 42 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, supplier reserves were $115 million and $102 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2012 and 2011 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2012 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $16 million in 2012. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,335 million and $1,297 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011 and deferred tax liabilities of $2,495 million and $2,261 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $101 million and $99 million for 2012 and 2011 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $19 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for 2012. Share Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share based compensation. We account for all share based compensation transactions using a fair value based measurement method. The share based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight line basis. We estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the Black Scholes options pricing model. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience. 43 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate materially differs from the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to revise the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase or decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates. Our assessments of estimated share based compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share based awards and the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the future share based compensation expense may differ from the Companys historical amounts. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long term and short term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time to time, we may access the long term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,950 million in 2012 compared to $2,338 million in 2011 and $2,316 million in 2010. Operating activities for 2012 reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases, partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth. Operating activities for 2011 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth, partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases. Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the AWP litigation private payer settlement payments of $350 million. 44 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,502 million in 2012 compared to $624 million in 2011 and $309 million in 2010. Investing activities for 2012 included $1,156 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $919 million for our acquisition of the Katz Assets. Investing activities in 2012 also included $225 million and $178 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2011 included $292 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $244 million for our acquisition of US Oncology, and $109 million of cash received from the sale of MAP. Investing activities in 2011 also included $233 million and $155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2010 included $199 million and $179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP private litigation settlement payments. Financing activities utilized cash of $1,905 million in 2012 compared to $1,841 million in 2011 and $421 million in 2010. Financing activities for 2012 included $1,850 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 7.75% Notes in February 2012, $195 million of dividends paid, $400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and $167 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2011 reflect $1,689 million of cash received from the issuance of long term debt. In February 2011, we issued $600 million of 3.25% notes due 2016, $600 million of 4.75% notes due 2021, and $500 million of 6.00% notes due 2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of the long term notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used to pay off the $1,730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of US Oncology. Also as part of our acquisition of US Oncology, we borrowed $1,000 million for bridge financing which was fully repaid by February 2011. Financing activities for 2011 also included $2,050 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $171 million of cash paid for dividends and $367 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2010 included $323 million of cash paid for share repurchases and $218 million of cash paid on our long term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010, $131 million of cash paid for dividends and $212 million of cash receipts from employees exercises of stock options. The Companys Board has authorized the repurchase of McKessons common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of the Companys common stock as follows: $1.0 billion in April 2010, $1.0 billion in October 2010, $1.0 billion in April 2011 and $650 million in January 2012. Total share repurchases transacted through ASR programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 Number of shares repurchased (1) 20 29 8 Average price paid per share $ 83.47 $ 69.62 $ 41.47 Total value of shares repurchased $ 1,850 $ 2,032 $ 299 (1) Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding. 45 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2012 and 2011, the majority of our share repurchases were transacted through a number of ASR programs with third party financial institutions as follows: $1.0 billion in May 2010, $275 million in March 2011, $650 million in May 2011 and $1.2 billion in March 2012. In 2010, all of our share repurchases were conducted through open market transactions. All programs were funded with cash on hand. In March 2012, we entered into an ASR program with a third party financial institution to repurchase $1.2 billion of the Companys common stock. As of March 31, 2012, we had received 12 million shares representing the minimum number of shares due under this program, and the average price paid per share of $87.19 was based on the average daily volume weighted average price of our common stock less a discount calculated as of March 31, 2012. The total number of shares to be ultimately repurchased by us and the final settlement price per share will be determined at the completion of this program based on the average daily volume weighted average price of our common stock during the program, less a discount. This program is anticipated to be completed no later than the second quarter of 2013. In April 2012, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional $700 million of the Companys common stock, bringing the total authorization outstanding to $1.0 billion. Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,149 $ 3,612 $ 3,731 Working capital 1,917 3,631 4,492 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents 831 392 (1,434) Debt to capital ratio (1) 36.8% 35.7% 23.4% Net debt to net capital employed (2) 10.8% 5.1% (23.5)% Return on stockholders equity (3) 19.7% 16.9% 18.7% (1) Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders equity. (2) Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (net debt), divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders equity (net capital employed). (3) Ratio is computed as net income for the last four quarters, divided by a five quarter average of stockholders equity. Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2012 included approximately $1.4 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. During the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to IRS regulations, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. The duration of this temporary loan to the United States was less than 60 days. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. 46 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payables, other accrued liabilities and the current portion of long term debt, partially offset by an increase in receivables. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011 primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010 primarily due to an increase in total debt as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. In May 2010, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.12 to $0.18 per common share and in April 2011, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.18 to $0.20 per common share. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid total cash dividends of $195 million, $171 million and $131 million. Contractual Obligations: The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2012: Years (In millions) Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5 On balance sheet Long term debt (1) $ 3,580 $ 508 $ 353 $ 1,100 $ 1,619 Other (2) 405 49 180 66 110 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3) 1,787 195 313 269 1,010 Purchase obligations (4) 576 476 90 10 Operating lease obligations (5) 868 188 280 167 233 Customer guarantees (6) 166 107 35 3 21 Total $ 7,382 $ 1,523 $ 1,251 $ 1,615 $ 2,993 (1) Represents maturities of the Companys long term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. (2) Represents our estimated benefit payments for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. (3) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long term debt obligations. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements. (5) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases. (6) Represents primarily agreements with certain of our Canadian customers financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers inventory or our customers debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. We also have an agreement with one software customer that, under limited circumstances, may require us to secure standby financing. Because the amount of the standby financing is not explicitly stated, the overall amount of this guarantee cannot reasonably be estimated. At March 31, 2012, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $504 million. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. In addition, at March 31, 2012, our banks and insurance companies have issued $86 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers compensation and automotive liability programs. 47 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Credit Resources: We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, as well as, short term borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility, revolving credit facility and from commercial paper issuances. Senior Bridge Term Loan Facility In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010, we entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (Bridge Loan). In December 2010, we reduced the Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the funds obtained under the Bridge Loan with long term debt, as further described below, and the Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the Bridge Loan bore interest of 1.76%, which was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Companys credit rating. Bridge Loan fees in 2011 of $25 million were included in interest expense. US Oncology Debt Acquired Upon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012, and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including the remaining accrued interest, for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our Bridge Loan. Long Term Debt On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, 4.75% notes due March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and 6.00% notes due March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2011. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the Bridge Loan. We repaid our $400 million 7.75% Notes in February 2012 and our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes in March 2010, both of which had matured. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2011, we renewed our existing accounts receivable sales facility for a one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place. The committed capacity of this facility is $1.35 billion, although, from time to time, the available amount of this facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. During 2012, we borrowed $400 million under this facility. There were no borrowings in 2011 under this facility. At March 31, 2012, there were $400 million in secured borrowings and $400 million of related securitized accounts receivable outstanding, which are included in short term borrowings and receivables in the consolidated balance sheets, under this facility. At March 31, 2011 there were no secured borrowings or related securitized accounts receivables outstanding under this facility. The current accounts receivable sales facility will expire in May 2012. We anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 12, Significant Accounting Policies and Debt and Financing Activities, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 48 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revolving Credit Facility In September 2011, we renewed our existing syndicated $1.3 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in June 2012. This renewed credit facility has terms and conditions substantially similar to those previously in place and matures in September 2016. Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate. There were no borrowings under this credit facility during 2012, 2011 and 2010. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Commercial Paper There were no commercial paper issuances during 2012, 2011 and 2010 and no amount outstanding at March 31, 2012 and 2011. Debt Covenant Our various borrowing facilities and long term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. For the purpose of calculating the debt to capital ratio under this covenant, borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility are excluded. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 21, Related Party Balances and Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest rate risk: Our long term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2012, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2012, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $18 million. The selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. The estimated fair value of our long term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2012, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 50 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION
