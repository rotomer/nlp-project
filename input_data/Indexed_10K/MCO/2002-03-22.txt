Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Certain of the selected financial data is derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Moodys. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of such data in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity. Through September 30, 2000, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although Moodys management believes these allocations are reasonable, such allocated costs are not necessarily indicative of the actual costs that would have been incurred if Moodys had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million, $17.2 million, $16.4 million and $15.8 million in 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. There were no such allocations in 2001. Year Ended December 31, amounts in millions, except per share data 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Results of operations(1) Revenue $ 796.7 $ 602.3 $ 564.2 $ 513.9 $ 457.4 Expenses(2) 398.2 313.8 293.8 288.4 267.4 Operating income 398.5 288.5 270.4 225.5 190.0 Non operating (expense) income, net(3) (16.6 ) (4.5 ) 8.5 12.4 0.2 Income before provision for income taxes 381.9 284.0 278.9 237.9 190.2 Provision for income taxes 169.7 125.5 123.3 95.9 64.0 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 212.2 158.5 155.6 142.0 126.2 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income tax benefit(4) (20.3 ) Net income $ 212.2 $ 158.5 $ 155.6 $ 142.0 $ 105.9 Dividends declared per share $ 0.180 $ 0.045 $ $ $ Earnings per share Basic $ 1.35 $ 0.98 $ 0.96 $ 0.84 $ 0.62 Diluted $ 1.32 $ 0.97 $ 0.95 $ 0.83 $ 0.61 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 157.6 161.7 162.3 169.5 170.8 Diluted 160.2 163.0 164.3 171.7 172.6 As of December 31, 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 (Unaudited) Balance sheet data Total assets $ 505.4 $ 398.3 $ 274.8 $ 296.2 $ 266.5 Long term debt 300.0 300.0 Shareholders equity $ (304.1 ) $ (282.5 ) $ (223.1 ) $ (192.6 ) $ (152.9 ) (1) The results of operations above include the following amounts related to the Financial Information Services (FIS) business that was sold in July 1998: revenue of $18.4 million and $34.3 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively, and operating income of $4.2 million and $5.8 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Included in non operating (expense) income, net are pre tax gains on the sale of FIS of $9.2 million in 1999 and $12.6 million in 1998. (2) Expenses in 2001 included unusual expenses of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other costs related to a settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001; $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation; and $3.4 million for the write down of investments in Argentine rating agencies. (3) Non operating (expense) income, net in 2001 and 2000 included $22.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of interest expense which principally related to the $300 million of notes payable outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. These amounts were partially offset by interest income on invested cash of $6.5 million in 2001 and $2.2 million in 2000. Interest expense and income was immaterial in 1999, 1998 and 1997. (4) Represents the impact of a change in revenue recognition policies whereby the Company began recognizing certain revenues over the service period, instead of as previously recognized, at the time of billing. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys or the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Moodys is a leading global credit rating, research and risk analysis firm in terms of market position, revenue, income and a number of other relevant standards. The Company publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations. These include various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, issued in domestic and international markets. Moodys also assigns ratings to issuers of securities, insurance company obligations, bank loans, derivative products, bank deposits and other bank debt and managed funds. Closely integrated with its ratings services, Moodys provides research services that are utilized by institutional investors and other credit professionals. Moodys publishes more than 100 research products covering areas such as investment grade and speculative grade corporate bonds, the banking sector, municipal bonds and mortgage and asset backed securities, in cross border and domestic markets worldwide. Moodys Risk Management Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Moodys (Moodys Risk Management Services or MRMS), develops and distributes credit risk assessment software used by banks and other financial institutions in their portfolio management, commercial lending and other activities. Moodys Risk Management Services also provides credit modeling tools, analytics, credit education materials, seminars, computer based lending simulations and other products and services that have enabled it to develop continuing relationships with its clients. In January 2000, MRMS acquired a financial software products company that provided credit risk assessment software to financial institutions. In February 2002, the Company announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a market based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all cash transaction for $210 million. Moodys expects the transaction to close by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and its existing bank credit lines. The acquisition will expand the customer base and product offerings of Moodys credit risk assessment business. Factors Affecting Comparability On September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) separated into two independent, publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). The separation was accomplished through a tax free distribution to the shareholders of Old DB of all of the shares of common stock of a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, New DB, which comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. Old DBs common stock became Moodys common stock, and shares of common stock of Old DB represent a continuing interest in the Moodys Business. The financial statements of Moodys have been restated to reflect the recapitalization described above. The method by which Old DB distributed its shares is herein after referred to as the Distribution. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the DB Business were allocated to New DB and all assets and liabilities of the Moodys Business were allocated to Moodys. The net indebtedness of Old DB at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moodys Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moodys as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old DB corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old DB at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old DB prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Management believes these allocations are reasonable. However, the costs of these services and benefits charged to Moodys are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if Moodys had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported 13 Table of Contents amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Moodys bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets and undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets and goodwill, and stock options. In addition, during 2001, Moodys recorded estimated insurance recoveries related to the impact of the September 11th tragedy. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Below are descriptions of some of the judgments that Moodys makes in applying its accounting policies in these areas. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Such areas are discussed below. Moodys monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 included approximately $15 million related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. Under the Companys frequent issuer program (FIP) arrangements, ratings customers pay a fixed annual fee regardless of issuance activity, with reduced transaction fees as securities are issued and rated and an overall cap on annual billings. Moodys amortizes the fixed annual fees on a straight line basis over the contract period, which is generally one year. As customers reach their annual billing caps, transaction fees are deferred and prorated over the contract period to match revenue with future services for which no further billings will be made. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 included approximately $2 million related to deferred FIP transaction fees. In addition, Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed in the following quarter when actual data is available. At December 31, 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $18 million of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowances Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance and totaled approximately $29 million or 3.6% of revenue in 2001. Adjustments to and write offs of receivables are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moodys considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moodys has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $32.6 million at December 31, 2001. However, if Moodys profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $26 million of undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently managements intent to permanently re invest those earnings in its subsidiaries. If managements approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, resolution of these matters in amounts that are different from what has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements could have a material impact on Moodys reported results and financial position. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moodys assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates, identifiable intangible and long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This evaluation requires the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Companys conduct of its operations, and it requires the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. Based on such assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a pre tax charge of $3.4 million to write off a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Companys judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the Companys investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets and goodwill. Stock Options In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the Company has elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to options granted, and instead has disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to the financial statements. The stock option values that underly the disclosures are based on assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances existing when options are exercised could cause the actual cost of the options to differ from these estimates. In addition to the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001, as disclosed in Note 8, Stock Options, to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Moodys granted approximately 3.5 million options in February 2002. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated value of this grant was $36 million, approximately 10% of Moodys 2001 pre tax income. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2001, approximately $24 million was spent on such repurchases (after option proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 9% of the Companys after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Insurance Recovery Estimates As a result of the September 11th tragedy, Moodys was displaced from its New York City headquarters building for approximately two months. The Company quickly restored operations and conducted its business from various temporary office locations during its displacement. Incremental costs of approximately $6.5 million were incurred during this period, principally related to restoration of the building, use of temporary office facilities and restoration of critical systems. Moodys has filed for recovery of these costs under its all risk property and business interruption insurance policy. The Company believes that a substantial portion of the costs will be recovered and has reflected an appropriate receivable on its December 31, 2001 balance sheet; if such recovery were less than anticipated, a charge to earnings would be made for the unrecovered amounts. Operating Segments Moodys operates primarily in one reportable business segment: ratings, which accounts for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. The ratings segment is composed of four ratings groups: corporate finance, structured finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance. Given the dominance of the ratings segment to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure and report operating income for the ratings business. Rather, revenue is the predominant measure utilized by senior management for assessing performance and for the allocation of resources, and operating income is evaluated for Moodys as a whole. Moodys also reports revenue separately for two geographic areas: U.S. and international. Revenue included in Other consists of research revenue, generated from the sale of investor oriented credit research, and risk management services revenue, generated from the sale of credit risk assessment software and related products and services. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Moodys revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue across all ratings groups. Other revenue reflected double digit growth in both Moodys Risk Management Services and research revenue. Moodys ratings revenue was $694.4 million in 2001, an increase of 33.6% from $519.6 million in 2000. Strong double digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance and public finance drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. European structured finance was very strong due primarily to asset backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and credit derivatives. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds. The strong revenue growth also reflected the success of Moodys Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were 15 Table of Contents initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Other revenue increased $19.6 million, or 23.7%, to $102.3 million in 2001. Moodys Risk Management Services revenue grew 33.9% to $30.8 million, driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of 30.7% over $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000 and public finance issuance dollar volume grew by 43%. In U.S. structured finance, asset backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. Moodys international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001 compared to $173.4 million in 2000, an increase of 36.1%. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double digit growth. International revenue at Moodys Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 2001 operating expenses of $239.6 million grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in worldwide structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in Argentine rating agencies, due to the recent currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results, unusual costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other costs related to the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001 and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Moodys operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year, the Companys 2001 operating margin was 50%, up from 48% a year earlier and above our long term target of 48%. Non operating expense increased to $16.6 million in 2001 from $4.5 million in 2000. This was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Companys private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.4% for 2001 compared to 44.2% for 2000. Reported net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared to $158.5 million in 2000, an increase of 33.9%. Basic earnings per share were $1.35 in 2001 and $0.98 in 2000, an increase of 37.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.32 in 2001 and $0.97 in 2000, an increase of 36.1%. On a pro forma basis, including interest expense on the private placement debt (and excluding any interest income) for both periods, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.30 for 2001 compared with $0.91 for 2000, a gain of 42.9%. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1999 Moodys revenue was $602.3 million in 2000, an increase of $38.1 million or 6.8% from $564.2 million in 1999. The increase reflected modest growth in ratings revenue, with strong gains in global structured finance ratings, partially offset by the impact of declines in several sectors of the U.S. market. Other revenue reflected strong growth in Moodys Risk Management Services, primarily related to the acquisition of a financial software products company in January 2000. It also reflected double digit growth in research revenue, driven by international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Moodys ratings revenue was $519.6 million in 2000, an increase of 3.5% from $502.2 million in 1999. Strong growth in global structured finance and international corporate finance was partially offset by the effects of a decline in securities issuance in the U.S. capital markets. Structured finance ratings revenue of $199.2 million in 2000 grew 15.5% over 1999 revenue of $172.4 million. The increase in 16 Table of Contents 2000 revenue was principally the result of strong growth in the asset backed and derivatives markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Moodys revenue from ratings of U.S. credit derivatives grew by 12% in 2000, as the number of collateralized debt obligations that Moodys rated increased by 14%. Revenue from corporate ratings was $162.7 million in 2000 compared with $165.5 million in 1999, a decline of 1.7%. Revenue from high yield ratings declined in 2000, as the number of issues during the year was 55% lower than in 1999. This impact was substantially offset by revenue from new European issuers and double digit growth in bank loan ratings revenue. Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $111.6 million in 2000, an increase of 6.5% over $104.8 million in 1999. Growth in 2000 reflected 21% volume growth in international bond and medium term note issuance, somewhat offset by the negative effects of a decline in U.S. debt issuance and U.S. industry consolidation in this sector. Public finance ratings revenue declined 22.5% to $46.1 million in 2000, from $59.5 million in 1999. The decrease was principally the result of a 16% decline in the number of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2000 compared to 1999. Other revenue increased 33.4% to $82.7 million in 2000, reflecting double digit growth in research revenue due to strong demand for products delivered via the Internet and increased international sales. In addition, Moodys Risk Management Services revenue more than doubled compared to 1999, primarily due to the acquisition of a financial software products company in January 2000. Revenue in the United States was $428.9 million in 2000, an increase of 1.3% over $423.4 million in 1999. Ratings revenue declined 1% compared to the prior year, as the effects of lower issuance levels in the core corporate and public finance sectors were substantially offset by strong growth in asset backed finance, credit derivatives and bank loan ratings. Double digit revenue growth was achieved in Moodys Risk Management Services and research revenue. Moodys international revenue was $173.4 million in 2000 versus $140.8 million in 1999, an increase of 23.2%. This performance was principally driven by strong growth in ratings of international structured finance securities, particularly in Europe and Japan, and an increased number of European corporate issuers. Strong growth was achieved in international research revenue, reflecting new products and geographic expansion, and in Moodys Risk Management Services revenue. 2000 operating expenses of $189.6 million grew 3.3% from $183.6 million in 1999. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in worldwide structured finance. This growth was partially offset by cost containment efforts in light of low revenue growth in the U.S. and lower production and delivery costs due to conversion of research products to Internet delivery. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $107.6 million in 2000 were up 10.7% compared to $97.2 million in 1999. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support international business expansion, increased corporate overhead costs resulting from becoming a separate public company and higher sales related costs in the risk management services business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $13.0 million in 1999 to $16.6 million in 2000, principally reflecting amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to the previously mentioned acquisition. Moodys operating income of $288.5 million in 2000 was up 6.7% from $270.4 million in 1999. Non operating expense of $4.5 million in 2000 principally reflected interest expense related to Moodys private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Non operating income of $8.5 million in 1999 principally reflected a $9.2 million gain related to the 1998 sale of the Companys Financial Information Services business (FIS). Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% for both 2000 and 1999. Reported net income was $158.5 million in 2000 compared with $155.6 million in 1999, an increase of 1.9%. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2000 were $0.98 and $0.97, respectively, compared to $0.96 and $0.95, respectively, in 1999. Excluding the 1999 gain related to the sale of FIS, and including interest expense on the private placement debt (but excluding any interest income) for both periods, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.91 in 2000 compared with $0.84 in 1999, an increase of 8.3%. Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1998 Moodys revenue was $564.2 million in 1999, an increase of 9.8% from $513.9 million in 1998. Revenue in 1998 included $18.4 million related to FIS, which was sold in July 1998. Excluding FIS, Moodys 1999 revenue grew 13.9% from $495.5 million in 1998. The strong revenue performance reflected double digit growth in ratings revenue, fueled by continued expansion of European capital markets and growth in several sectors of the U.S. market. Moodys 1999 revenue also reflected double digit growth in research revenue, driven by international expansion and new product introductions. Moodys ratings revenue was $502.2 million in 1999, an increase of 13.7% from $441.5 million in 1998. This growth was principally driven by ratings of corporate bonds, structured finance products and commercial paper. International ratings revenue growth was especially strong, as the introduction of the Euro and a significant increase in merger related financing drove significant growth in European capital markets. These revenue gains were partially offset by the effects of volume declines in the U.S. high yield and municipal markets, compared to strong performance in these markets in 1998. 17 Table of Contents Structured finance ratings revenue of $172.4 million in 1999 grew 20.6% over 1998 revenue of $143.0 million. The increase in 1999 revenue was principally the result of strong growth in the asset backed and derivatives markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Moodys revenue from ratings of U.S. credit derivatives grew by more than 40% in 1999, as issuance volumes surged to record levels. Revenue from corporate ratings was $165.5 million in 1999 compared with $143.6 million in 1998, an increase of 15.3%. The revenue growth was principally driven by strong international issuance volumes. U.S. bank loan ratings activity expanded significantly in 1999 as Moodys rated more than $300 billion of new loans, an increase of 50% over 1998. Revenue from high yield ratings declined in 1999, as issuance dollar volume during the year was approximately 32% lower than 1998s record level. Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $104.8 million in 1999, an increase of 16.3% over $90.1 million in 1998. The increase principally reflected higher debt issuance in and expanded coverage of the global banking sector. Public finance ratings revenue declined 8.2% to $59.5 million in 1999 from $64.8 million in 1998. The decrease was principally the result of lower municipal debt issuance in 1999 following 1998s near record level. Revenue in the United States was $423.4 million in 1999, an increase of 2.5% over $413.0 million in 1998. Excluding the 1998 revenue of FIS, United States revenue increased 7.1% in 1999, from $395.3 million in 1998. This increase was principally the result of gains in structured finance, commercial paper and bank loan ratings, partially offset by the effects of volume declines in the high yield and municipal markets. Moodys international revenue was $140.8 million in 1999 versus $100.9 million in 1998, an increase of 39.5%. Excluding the 1998 revenue of FIS, international revenue increased 40.5% in 1999 from $100.2 million in 1998. This performance was principally driven by growth in European capital markets, where the introduction of the Euro and a significant increase in merger related financing drove strong debt issuance. Strong growth was also achieved in ratings of international asset backed securities, particularly in Europe and Japan. 1999 operating expenses of $183.6 million grew $6.3 million, or 3.6%, from $177.3 million in 1998. Excluding 1998 operating expense of $8.5 million related to FIS, 1999 operating expense increased by $14.8 million, or 8.8%. The increase principally reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and the structured finance business. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $97.2 million in 1999 were up $1.5 million compared to $95.7 million in 1998. Excluding $4.6 million of 1998 selling, general and administrative expenses related to FIS, 1999 expense grew by $6.1 million, or 6.7%. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs. Depreciation and amortization expense was $13.0 million in 1999, a decrease of $2.4 million from 1998. Excluding FIS depreciation and amortization expense of $1.1 million in 1998, the 1999 expense declined by $1.3 million. This reflected lower levels of capital spending in 1998 and 1999 versus prior years, partly as a result of declining technology costs. Moodys operating income of $270.4 million in 1999 was up 19.9% from $225.5 million in 1998. Excluding 1998 operating income related to FIS of $4.2 million, 1999 operating income grew 22.2% from $221.3 million in 1998. Non operating income, net, was $8.5 million in 1999 and $12.4 million in 1998. Non operating income included pre tax gains related to the sale of FIS of $9.2 million in 1999 and $12.6 million in 1998. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% for 1999, compared with 40.3% in 1998. The change resulted from an increase in the percentage of Moodys income allocable to states with high income tax rates and refinements of certain estimates. Moodys reported net income was $155.6 million in 1999 versus $142.0 million in 1998, an increase of 9.6%. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 1999 were $0.96 and $0.95, respectively, compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.84 and $0.83, respectively, in 1998. Moodys results included after tax gains related to the sale of FIS of $5.1 million ($0.03 per basic and diluted share) in 1999 and $7.5 million ($0.04 per basic and diluted share) in 1998. Excluding these gains, Moodys 1999 net income of $150.5 million increased 11.9% or $16.0 million over $134.5 million in 1998. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 16 countries outside the United States and over 90% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was billed and collected in U.S. dollars. Approximately 25% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 12% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $163.2 million at December 31, 2001, approximately $34 million was located outside the United States (with $28 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effect of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its 18 Table of Contents cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, going forward, the Company will assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $306.3 million, $67.6 million, and $197.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, the $174.6 million income tax related payment in 2000 that is described later in this section and year to year growth in Moodys net income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected a deferral of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes that normally would have been paid during the year; such taxes were paid in January 2002. Moodys accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.5 million higher than at December 31, 2000. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year end 2001 were $47.4 million higher than the prior year end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2002. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to a payment of approximately $174.6 million, representing Moodys 50% share, in connection with an amended tax return filed by Old DB on May 12, 2000. In addition, payments for incentive compensation in 2000 were higher than in 1999. The $15.0 million increase in accounts receivable in 2000 reflected strong growth in fourth quarter billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $30.0 million, $33.6 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 amount included $15.2 million of investments in international rating agencies. The increase in cash used from 1999 to 2000 was principally due to the acquisition of a financial software products company in January 2000 for $17.4 million. In addition, the Company increased its spending on computer equipment and software development from 1999 to 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally include investments in purchasing, developing and upgrading computer hardware, software and systems, and improvements to owned and leased office facilities, were $14.8 million in 2001, $14.4 million in 2000 and $12.9 million in 1999. Currently, the Company has commitments related to its planned acquisition of KMV for $210 million and contingent payments of up to $5.4 million related to the Companys investment in Korea Investors Service. See Notes 5, Investments in Affiliates, and 17, Subsequent Event, to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further detail. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($233.0) million, $81.6 million and ($186.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 and 2000 amounts consisted primarily of $267.6 million and $71.8 million, respectively, for repurchases of the Companys common stock under its share repurchase program. These amounts were offset in part by stock option proceeds and related tax benefits of $62.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In addition, the 2001 and 2000 amounts included dividends paid of $28.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The 2000 amount also included $104.5 million of net proceeds from the private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter and distributions made to Old DB through the Distribution Date. The 1999 amount represents a net distribution to Old DB. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes in a private placement (the Notes). The private placement notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. The cash proceeds from the private placement were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The revolving credit facility (the Facility), which was undrawn as of December 31, 2001, consists of an $80 million 5 year facility and an $80 million 364 day facility. Interest rates on borrowings under the Facility are based on prevailing short term rates at the time of such borrowings. As noted below, Moodys intends to draw down on this Facility to initially fund the planned acquisition of KMV. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2001 the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated time frame, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. 19 Table of Contents At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. In February 2002, Moodys reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a market based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all cash transaction for $210 million. Moodys expects the transaction to close by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and its existing $160 million Facility. The Company plans to secure more permanent financing for all or part of the purchase price, in order to retain open bank credit lines and to use its cash flow from operations for share repurchases. The KMV acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions and there can be no guarantee that the transaction will be consummated or that the Company will be able to successfully integrate the KMV and Moodys Risk Management Services businesses. Moodys expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2002. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results in this section. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, which might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 90% of Moodys revenue in 2001 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities issued in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2001 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong issuance volumes driven by the favorable interest rate environment in the U.S. and very strong growth in global structured finance issuance. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction of the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from Standard Poors Credit Market Service, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit rating, research and risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor to maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more 20 Table of Contents aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages arising from allegedly inaccurate ratings. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding study of the regulation of credit rating agencies. Changes in the current U.S. regulatory regime could increase Moodys costs or change the environment in which Moodys operates. Failure to maintain governmental authorizations or to comply with local laws and regulations could negatively impact the ability of Moodys to compete in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of such factors could have such an effect in the future. Share Repurchase Program In October 2000, the Board of Directors of Moodys Corporation authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250 million, which amount was subsequently increased to $300 million. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the companys employee benefit arrangements. In October 2001, Moodys Board of Directors authorized special and systematic share repurchases of up to an additional $300 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $72 million. For the full year 2001, Moodys repurchased 8.5 million shares at a total cost of $268 million, bringing total repurchases since program inception to 11.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $340 million. This includes 3.4 million shares, at a cost of approximately $103 million, to offset issuances under Moodys stock plans. Moodys anticipates completing the current $300 million share repurchase program by mid 2003. Contingencies Moodys is involved in legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business. In the opinion of management, although the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted 21 Table of Contents with certainty, the ultimate liability of Moodys in connection with such legal proceedings will not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, Moodys has certain other contingencies discussed below. Tax Matters Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise with respect to the matters described below, to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. It is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that one or more of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably. At this time, Moodys management is unable to predict the extent of such reviews, the outcome thereof or whether the resolution of these matters could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000, of which 50% was on behalf of Moodys. IMS Health has informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing. Notwithstanding the filing and payment, New DB is contesting the IRSs formal assessment and would also contest the assessment of amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. Moodys had previously accrued its anticipated share of the probable liability arising from the utilization of these capital losses. Information Resources, Inc. On July 29, 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley), ACNielsen Company, (a subsidiary of ACNielsen Corporation) and IMS International Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant Corporation). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of Donnelley. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI has asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages in an unspecified amount. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, as a condition to the Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities relating to the IRI action. However, under the Distribution Agreement, as between themselves, each of New DB and Moodys has agreed to be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made in respect of the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement or otherwise, including any legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of such matter could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. See Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Contingencies, for additional information. LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs dEmprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs dEmprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of approximately $2.43 billion plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. Dividends During 2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 22 Table of Contents 2001 and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moodys was a subsidiary of Old DB, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old DB shareholders. In December 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2002 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2002 to shareholders of record on February 28, 2002. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of the Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information As described above in Item 1 Business The Distribution, the Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000 the Companys common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2002 was 5,754. Price Per Share Dividends Paid High Low Per Share From October 3, 2000 through December 31, 2000 $ 28.88 $ 22.63 $ 0.045 2001: First quarter $ 29.11 $ 25.49 $ 0.045 Second quarter $ 34.85 $ 26.17 $ 0.045 Third quarter $ 37.00 $ 30.60 $ 0.045 Fourth quarter $ 41.10 $ 31.46 $ 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2001 $ 41.10 $ 25.49 $ 0.180 Fees of Independent Accountants During 2001, Moodys incurred $3.7 million for services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), its independent accountants. The aggregate fees of PwC for professional services rendered for the audit of the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the review of the financial statements included in the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q during such year were approximately $0.6 million. PwC did not render professional services to the Company relating to financial information systems design and implementation, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The aggregate fees for services rendered by PwC to the Company, were approximately $3.1 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed in 2001). Approximately one half of such fees were for consultation on various tax matters of a non recurring nature, in connection with the Companys transition to an independent company. The remainder principally related to tax consulting and compliance, expatriate tax services, acquisition reviews and statutory audits of non U.S. subsidiaries. It is the intention of the Company in 2002 to substantially reduce the amount of non audit services provided by PwC and thereafter to minimize the amount of these services from PwC, compatible with their efficient use. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this Form 10 K are forward looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moodys business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are made as of the date of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001, and management disclaims any duty to update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; and the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 K. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys or the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Moodys is a leading global credit rating, research and risk analysis firm in terms of market position, revenue, income and a number of other relevant standards. The Company publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations. These include various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, issued in domestic and international markets. Moodys also assigns ratings to issuers of securities, insurance company obligations, bank loans, derivative products, bank deposits and other bank debt and managed funds. Closely integrated with its ratings services, Moodys provides research services that are utilized by institutional investors and other credit professionals. Moodys publishes more than 100 research products covering areas such as investment grade and speculative grade corporate bonds, the banking sector, municipal bonds and mortgage and asset backed securities, in cross border and domestic markets worldwide. Moodys Risk Management Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Moodys (Moodys Risk Management Services or MRMS), develops and distributes credit risk assessment software used by banks and other financial institutions in their portfolio management, commercial lending and other activities. Moodys Risk Management Services also provides credit modeling tools, analytics, credit education materials, seminars, computer based lending simulations and other products and services that have enabled it to develop continuing relationships with its clients. In January 2000, MRMS acquired a financial software products company that provided credit risk assessment software to financial institutions. In February 2002, the Company announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a market based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all cash transaction for $210 million. Moodys expects the transaction to close by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and its existing bank credit lines. The acquisition will expand the customer base and product offerings of Moodys credit risk assessment business. Factors Affecting Comparability On September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) separated into two independent, publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). The separation was accomplished through a tax free distribution to the shareholders of Old DB of all of the shares of common stock of a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, New DB, which comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. Old DBs common stock became Moodys common stock, and shares of common stock of Old DB represent a continuing interest in the Moodys Business. The financial statements of Moodys have been restated to reflect the recapitalization described above. The method by which Old DB distributed its shares is herein after referred to as the Distribution. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the DB Business were allocated to New DB and all assets and liabilities of the Moodys Business were allocated to Moodys. The net indebtedness of Old DB at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moodys Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moodys as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old DB corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old DB at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old DB prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Management believes these allocations are reasonable. However, the costs of these services and benefits charged to Moodys are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if Moodys had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported 13 Table of Contents amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Moodys bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets and undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets and goodwill, and stock options. In addition, during 2001, Moodys recorded estimated insurance recoveries related to the impact of the September 11th tragedy. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Below are descriptions of some of the judgments that Moodys makes in applying its accounting policies in these areas. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Such areas are discussed below. Moodys monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 included approximately $15 million related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. Under the Companys frequent issuer program (FIP) arrangements, ratings customers pay a fixed annual fee regardless of issuance activity, with reduced transaction fees as securities are issued and rated and an overall cap on annual billings. Moodys amortizes the fixed annual fees on a straight line basis over the contract period, which is generally one year. As customers reach their annual billing caps, transaction fees are deferred and prorated over the contract period to match revenue with future services for which no further billings will be made. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 included approximately $2 million related to deferred FIP transaction fees. In addition, Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed in the following quarter when actual data is available. At December 31, 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $18 million of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowances Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance and totaled approximately $29 million or 3.6% of revenue in 2001. Adjustments to and write offs of receivables are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moodys considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moodys has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $32.6 million at December 31, 2001. However, if Moodys profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $26 million of undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently managements intent to permanently re invest those earnings in its subsidiaries. If managements approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, resolution of these matters in amounts that are different from what has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements could have a material impact on Moodys reported results and financial position. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moodys assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates, identifiable intangible and long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This evaluation requires the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Companys conduct of its operations, and it requires the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. Based on such assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a pre tax charge of $3.4 million to write off a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Companys judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the Companys investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets and goodwill. Stock Options In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the Company has elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to options granted, and instead has disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to the financial statements. The stock option values that underly the disclosures are based on assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances existing when options are exercised could cause the actual cost of the options to differ from these estimates. In addition to the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001, as disclosed in Note 8, Stock Options, to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Moodys granted approximately 3.5 million options in February 2002. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated value of this grant was $36 million, approximately 10% of Moodys 2001 pre tax income. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2001, approximately $24 million was spent on such repurchases (after option proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 9% of the Companys after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Insurance Recovery Estimates As a result of the September 11th tragedy, Moodys was displaced from its New York City headquarters building for approximately two months. The Company quickly restored operations and conducted its business from various temporary office locations during its displacement. Incremental costs of approximately $6.5 million were incurred during this period, principally related to restoration of the building, use of temporary office facilities and restoration of critical systems. Moodys has filed for recovery of these costs under its all risk property and business interruption insurance policy. The Company believes that a substantial portion of the costs will be recovered and has reflected an appropriate receivable on its December 31, 2001 balance sheet; if such recovery were less than anticipated, a charge to earnings would be made for the unrecovered amounts. Operating Segments Moodys operates primarily in one reportable business segment: ratings, which accounts for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. The ratings segment is composed of four ratings groups: corporate finance, structured finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance. Given the dominance of the ratings segment to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure and report operating income for the ratings business. Rather, revenue is the predominant measure utilized by senior management for assessing performance and for the allocation of resources, and operating income is evaluated for Moodys as a whole. Moodys also reports revenue separately for two geographic areas: U.S. and international. Revenue included in Other consists of research revenue, generated from the sale of investor oriented credit research, and risk management services revenue, generated from the sale of credit risk assessment software and related products and services. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Moodys revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue across all ratings groups. Other revenue reflected double digit growth in both Moodys Risk Management Services and research revenue. Moodys ratings revenue was $694.4 million in 2001, an increase of 33.6% from $519.6 million in 2000. Strong double digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance and public finance drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. European structured finance was very strong due primarily to asset backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and credit derivatives. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds. The strong revenue growth also reflected the success of Moodys Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were 15 Table of Contents initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Other revenue increased $19.6 million, or 23.7%, to $102.3 million in 2001. Moodys Risk Management Services revenue grew 33.9% to $30.8 million, driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of 30.7% over $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000 and public finance issuance dollar volume grew by 43%. In U.S. structured finance, asset backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. Moodys international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001 compared to $173.4 million in 2000, an increase of 36.1%. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double digit growth. International revenue at Moodys Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 2001 operating expenses of $239.6 million grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in worldwide structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in Argentine rating agencies, due to the recent currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results, unusual costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other costs related to the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001 and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Moodys operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year, the Companys 2001 operating margin was 50%, up from 48% a year earlier and above our long term target of 48%. Non operating expense increased to $16.6 million in 2001 from $4.5 million in 2000. This was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Companys private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.4% for 2001 compared to 44.2% for 2000. Reported net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared to $158.5 million in 2000, an increase of 33.9%. Basic earnings per share were $1.35 in 2001 and $0.98 in 2000, an increase of 37.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.32 in 2001 and $0.97 in 2000, an increase of 36.1%. On a pro forma basis, including interest expense on the private placement debt (and excluding any interest income) for both periods, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.30 for 2001 compared with $0.91 for 2000, a gain of 42.9%. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1999 Moodys revenue was $602.3 million in 2000, an increase of $38.1 million or 6.8% from $564.2 million in 1999. The increase reflected modest growth in ratings revenue, with strong gains in global structured finance ratings, partially offset by the impact of declines in several sectors of the U.S. market. Other revenue reflected strong growth in Moodys Risk Management Services, primarily related to the acquisition of a financial software products company in January 2000. It also reflected double digit growth in research revenue, driven by international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Moodys ratings revenue was $519.6 million in 2000, an increase of 3.5% from $502.2 million in 1999. Strong growth in global structured finance and international corporate finance was partially offset by the effects of a decline in securities issuance in the U.S. capital markets. Structured finance ratings revenue of $199.2 million in 2000 grew 15.5% over 1999 revenue of $172.4 million. The increase in 16 Table of Contents 2000 revenue was principally the result of strong growth in the asset backed and derivatives markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Moodys revenue from ratings of U.S. credit derivatives grew by 12% in 2000, as the number of collateralized debt obligations that Moodys rated increased by 14%. Revenue from corporate ratings was $162.7 million in 2000 compared with $165.5 million in 1999, a decline of 1.7%. Revenue from high yield ratings declined in 2000, as the number of issues during the year was 55% lower than in 1999. This impact was substantially offset by revenue from new European issuers and double digit growth in bank loan ratings revenue. Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $111.6 million in 2000, an increase of 6.5% over $104.8 million in 1999. Growth in 2000 reflected 21% volume growth in international bond and medium term note issuance, somewhat offset by the negative effects of a decline in U.S. debt issuance and U.S. industry consolidation in this sector. Public finance ratings revenue declined 22.5% to $46.1 million in 2000, from $59.5 million in 1999. The decrease was principally the result of a 16% decline in the number of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2000 compared to 1999. Other revenue increased 33.4% to $82.7 million in 2000, reflecting double digit growth in research revenue due to strong demand for products delivered via the Internet and increased international sales. In addition, Moodys Risk Management Services revenue more than doubled compared to 1999, primarily due to the acquisition of a financial software products company in January 2000. Revenue in the United States was $428.9 million in 2000, an increase of 1.3% over $423.4 million in 1999. Ratings revenue declined 1% compared to the prior year, as the effects of lower issuance levels in the core corporate and public finance sectors were substantially offset by strong growth in asset backed finance, credit derivatives and bank loan ratings. Double digit revenue growth was achieved in Moodys Risk Management Services and research revenue. Moodys international revenue was $173.4 million in 2000 versus $140.8 million in 1999, an increase of 23.2%. This performance was principally driven by strong growth in ratings of international structured finance securities, particularly in Europe and Japan, and an increased number of European corporate issuers. Strong growth was achieved in international research revenue, reflecting new products and geographic expansion, and in Moodys Risk Management Services revenue. 2000 operating expenses of $189.6 million grew 3.3% from $183.6 million in 1999. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in worldwide structured finance. This growth was partially offset by cost containment efforts in light of low revenue growth in the U.S. and lower production and delivery costs due to conversion of research products to Internet delivery. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $107.6 million in 2000 were up 10.7% compared to $97.2 million in 1999. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support international business expansion, increased corporate overhead costs resulting from becoming a separate public company and higher sales related costs in the risk management services business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $13.0 million in 1999 to $16.6 million in 2000, principally reflecting amortization of goodwill and intangible assets related to the previously mentioned acquisition. Moodys operating income of $288.5 million in 2000 was up 6.7% from $270.4 million in 1999. Non operating expense of $4.5 million in 2000 principally reflected interest expense related to Moodys private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Non operating income of $8.5 million in 1999 principally reflected a $9.2 million gain related to the 1998 sale of the Companys Financial Information Services business (FIS). Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% for both 2000 and 1999. Reported net income was $158.5 million in 2000 compared with $155.6 million in 1999, an increase of 1.9%. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2000 were $0.98 and $0.97, respectively, compared to $0.96 and $0.95, respectively, in 1999. Excluding the 1999 gain related to the sale of FIS, and including interest expense on the private placement debt (but excluding any interest income) for both periods, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.91 in 2000 compared with $0.84 in 1999, an increase of 8.3%. Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1998 Moodys revenue was $564.2 million in 1999, an increase of 9.8% from $513.9 million in 1998. Revenue in 1998 included $18.4 million related to FIS, which was sold in July 1998. Excluding FIS, Moodys 1999 revenue grew 13.9% from $495.5 million in 1998. The strong revenue performance reflected double digit growth in ratings revenue, fueled by continued expansion of European capital markets and growth in several sectors of the U.S. market. Moodys 1999 revenue also reflected double digit growth in research revenue, driven by international expansion and new product introductions. Moodys ratings revenue was $502.2 million in 1999, an increase of 13.7% from $441.5 million in 1998. This growth was principally driven by ratings of corporate bonds, structured finance products and commercial paper. International ratings revenue growth was especially strong, as the introduction of the Euro and a significant increase in merger related financing drove significant growth in European capital markets. These revenue gains were partially offset by the effects of volume declines in the U.S. high yield and municipal markets, compared to strong performance in these markets in 1998. 17 Table of Contents Structured finance ratings revenue of $172.4 million in 1999 grew 20.6% over 1998 revenue of $143.0 million. The increase in 1999 revenue was principally the result of strong growth in the asset backed and derivatives markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Moodys revenue from ratings of U.S. credit derivatives grew by more than 40% in 1999, as issuance volumes surged to record levels. Revenue from corporate ratings was $165.5 million in 1999 compared with $143.6 million in 1998, an increase of 15.3%. The revenue growth was principally driven by strong international issuance volumes. U.S. bank loan ratings activity expanded significantly in 1999 as Moodys rated more than $300 billion of new loans, an increase of 50% over 1998. Revenue from high yield ratings declined in 1999, as issuance dollar volume during the year was approximately 32% lower than 1998s record level. Revenue from financial institution and sovereign risk ratings was $104.8 million in 1999, an increase of 16.3% over $90.1 million in 1998. The increase principally reflected higher debt issuance in and expanded coverage of the global banking sector. Public finance ratings revenue declined 8.2% to $59.5 million in 1999 from $64.8 million in 1998. The decrease was principally the result of lower municipal debt issuance in 1999 following 1998s near record level. Revenue in the United States was $423.4 million in 1999, an increase of 2.5% over $413.0 million in 1998. Excluding the 1998 revenue of FIS, United States revenue increased 7.1% in 1999, from $395.3 million in 1998. This increase was principally the result of gains in structured finance, commercial paper and bank loan ratings, partially offset by the effects of volume declines in the high yield and municipal markets. Moodys international revenue was $140.8 million in 1999 versus $100.9 million in 1998, an increase of 39.5%. Excluding the 1998 revenue of FIS, international revenue increased 40.5% in 1999 from $100.2 million in 1998. This performance was principally driven by growth in European capital markets, where the introduction of the Euro and a significant increase in merger related financing drove strong debt issuance. Strong growth was also achieved in ratings of international asset backed securities, particularly in Europe and Japan. 1999 operating expenses of $183.6 million grew $6.3 million, or 3.6%, from $177.3 million in 1998. Excluding 1998 operating expense of $8.5 million related to FIS, 1999 operating expense increased by $14.8 million, or 8.8%. The increase principally reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and the structured finance business. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $97.2 million in 1999 were up $1.5 million compared to $95.7 million in 1998. Excluding $4.6 million of 1998 selling, general and administrative expenses related to FIS, 1999 expense grew by $6.1 million, or 6.7%. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs. Depreciation and amortization expense was $13.0 million in 1999, a decrease of $2.4 million from 1998. Excluding FIS depreciation and amortization expense of $1.1 million in 1998, the 1999 expense declined by $1.3 million. This reflected lower levels of capital spending in 1998 and 1999 versus prior years, partly as a result of declining technology costs. Moodys operating income of $270.4 million in 1999 was up 19.9% from $225.5 million in 1998. Excluding 1998 operating income related to FIS of $4.2 million, 1999 operating income grew 22.2% from $221.3 million in 1998. Non operating income, net, was $8.5 million in 1999 and $12.4 million in 1998. Non operating income included pre tax gains related to the sale of FIS of $9.2 million in 1999 and $12.6 million in 1998. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% for 1999, compared with 40.3% in 1998. The change resulted from an increase in the percentage of Moodys income allocable to states with high income tax rates and refinements of certain estimates. Moodys reported net income was $155.6 million in 1999 versus $142.0 million in 1998, an increase of 9.6%. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 1999 were $0.96 and $0.95, respectively, compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.84 and $0.83, respectively, in 1998. Moodys results included after tax gains related to the sale of FIS of $5.1 million ($0.03 per basic and diluted share) in 1999 and $7.5 million ($0.04 per basic and diluted share) in 1998. Excluding these gains, Moodys 1999 net income of $150.5 million increased 11.9% or $16.0 million over $134.5 million in 1998. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 16 countries outside the United States and over 90% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was billed and collected in U.S. dollars. Approximately 25% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 12% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $163.2 million at December 31, 2001, approximately $34 million was located outside the United States (with $28 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effect of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its 18 Table of Contents cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, going forward, the Company will assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $306.3 million, $67.6 million, and $197.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, the $174.6 million income tax related payment in 2000 that is described later in this section and year to year growth in Moodys net income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected a deferral of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes that normally would have been paid during the year; such taxes were paid in January 2002. Moodys accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.5 million higher than at December 31, 2000. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year end 2001 were $47.4 million higher than the prior year end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2002. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to a payment of approximately $174.6 million, representing Moodys 50% share, in connection with an amended tax return filed by Old DB on May 12, 2000. In addition, payments for incentive compensation in 2000 were higher than in 1999. The $15.0 million increase in accounts receivable in 2000 reflected strong growth in fourth quarter billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $30.0 million, $33.6 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 amount included $15.2 million of investments in international rating agencies. The increase in cash used from 1999 to 2000 was principally due to the acquisition of a financial software products company in January 2000 for $17.4 million. In addition, the Company increased its spending on computer equipment and software development from 1999 to 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally include investments in purchasing, developing and upgrading computer hardware, software and systems, and improvements to owned and leased office facilities, were $14.8 million in 2001, $14.4 million in 2000 and $12.9 million in 1999. Currently, the Company has commitments related to its planned acquisition of KMV for $210 million and contingent payments of up to $5.4 million related to the Companys investment in Korea Investors Service. See Notes 5, Investments in Affiliates, and 17, Subsequent Event, to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further detail. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($233.0) million, $81.6 million and ($186.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 and 2000 amounts consisted primarily of $267.6 million and $71.8 million, respectively, for repurchases of the Companys common stock under its share repurchase program. These amounts were offset in part by stock option proceeds and related tax benefits of $62.9 million and $12.7 million, respectively. In addition, the 2001 and 2000 amounts included dividends paid of $28.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The 2000 amount also included $104.5 million of net proceeds from the private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter and distributions made to Old DB through the Distribution Date. The 1999 amount represents a net distribution to Old DB. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes in a private placement (the Notes). The private placement notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. The cash proceeds from the private placement were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The revolving credit facility (the Facility), which was undrawn as of December 31, 2001, consists of an $80 million 5 year facility and an $80 million 364 day facility. Interest rates on borrowings under the Facility are based on prevailing short term rates at the time of such borrowings. As noted below, Moodys intends to draw down on this Facility to initially fund the planned acquisition of KMV. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2001 the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated time frame, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. 19 Table of Contents At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. In February 2002, Moodys reached a definitive agreement to acquire KMV, a market based, quantitative credit risk management tools company, in an all cash transaction for $210 million. Moodys expects the transaction to close by the early part of the second quarter of 2002 and initially to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and its existing $160 million Facility. The Company plans to secure more permanent financing for all or part of the purchase price, in order to retain open bank credit lines and to use its cash flow from operations for share repurchases. The KMV acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions and there can be no guarantee that the transaction will be consummated or that the Company will be able to successfully integrate the KMV and Moodys Risk Management Services businesses. Moodys expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2002. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results in this section. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, which might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 90% of Moodys revenue in 2001 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities issued in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2001 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong issuance volumes driven by the favorable interest rate environment in the U.S. and very strong growth in global structured finance issuance. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction of the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from Standard Poors Credit Market Service, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit rating, research and risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor to maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more 20 Table of Contents aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages arising from allegedly inaccurate ratings. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding study of the regulation of credit rating agencies. Changes in the current U.S. regulatory regime could increase Moodys costs or change the environment in which Moodys operates. Failure to maintain governmental authorizations or to comply with local laws and regulations could negatively impact the ability of Moodys to compete in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of such factors could have such an effect in the future. Share Repurchase Program In October 2000, the Board of Directors of Moodys Corporation authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250 million, which amount was subsequently increased to $300 million. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the companys employee benefit arrangements. In October 2001, Moodys Board of Directors authorized special and systematic share repurchases of up to an additional $300 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $72 million. For the full year 2001, Moodys repurchased 8.5 million shares at a total cost of $268 million, bringing total repurchases since program inception to 11.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $340 million. This includes 3.4 million shares, at a cost of approximately $103 million, to offset issuances under Moodys stock plans. Moodys anticipates completing the current $300 million share repurchase program by mid 2003. Contingencies Moodys is involved in legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business. In the opinion of management, although the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted 21 Table of Contents with certainty, the ultimate liability of Moodys in connection with such legal proceedings will not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, Moodys has certain other contingencies discussed below. Tax Matters Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise with respect to the matters described below, to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. It is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that one or more of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably. At this time, Moodys management is unable to predict the extent of such reviews, the outcome thereof or whether the resolution of these matters could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000, of which 50% was on behalf of Moodys. IMS Health has informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing. Notwithstanding the filing and payment, New DB is contesting the IRSs formal assessment and would also contest the assessment of amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. Moodys had previously accrued its anticipated share of the probable liability arising from the utilization of these capital losses. Information Resources, Inc. On July 29, 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley), ACNielsen Company, (a subsidiary of ACNielsen Corporation) and IMS International Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant Corporation). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of Donnelley. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI has asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages in an unspecified amount. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, as a condition to the Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities relating to the IRI action. However, under the Distribution Agreement, as between themselves, each of New DB and Moodys has agreed to be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made in respect of the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement or otherwise, including any legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of such matter could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. See Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Contingencies, for additional information. LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs dEmprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs dEmprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of approximately $2.43 billion plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. Dividends During 2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 22 Table of Contents 2001 and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moodys was a subsidiary of Old DB, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old DB shareholders. In December 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2002 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2002 to shareholders of record on February 28, 2002. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of the Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information As described above in Item 1 Business The Distribution, the Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000 the Companys common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2002 was 5,754. Price Per Share Dividends Paid High Low Per Share From October 3, 2000 through December 31, 2000 $ 28.88 $ 22.63 $ 0.045 2001: First quarter $ 29.11 $ 25.49 $ 0.045 Second quarter $ 34.85 $ 26.17 $ 0.045 Third quarter $ 37.00 $ 30.60 $ 0.045 Fourth quarter $ 41.10 $ 31.46 $ 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2001 $ 41.10 $ 25.49 $ 0.180 Fees of Independent Accountants During 2001, Moodys incurred $3.7 million for services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), its independent accountants. The aggregate fees of PwC for professional services rendered for the audit of the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the review of the financial statements included in the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q during such year were approximately $0.6 million. PwC did not render professional services to the Company relating to financial information systems design and implementation, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The aggregate fees for services rendered by PwC to the Company, were approximately $3.1 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed in 2001). Approximately one half of such fees were for consultation on various tax matters of a non recurring nature, in connection with the Companys transition to an independent company. The remainder principally related to tax consulting and compliance, expatriate tax services, acquisition reviews and statutory audits of non U.S. subsidiaries. It is the intention of the Company in 2002 to substantially reduce the amount of non audit services provided by PwC and thereafter to minimize the amount of these services from PwC, compatible with their efficient use. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this Form 10 K are forward looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moodys business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are made as of the date of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001, and management disclaims any duty to update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; and the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 23 Table of Contents Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
