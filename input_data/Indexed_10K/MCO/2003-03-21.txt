Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 26 of this annual report on Form 10 K, is incorporated into this Item 3 by reference. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below and in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contingencies. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this 10 Table of Contents suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10 K, no matter was submitted to a vote of Security Holders. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Information in response to this Item is set forth under the captions Common Stock Information and Dividends in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The Companys selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of such data in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million, $17.2 million, and $16.4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity. 11 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, amounts in millions, except per share data 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Results of operations(1) (4) Revenue $ 1,023.3 $ 796.7 $ 602.3 $ 564.2 $ 513.9 Expenses(2) 485.2 398.2 313.8 293.8 288.4 Operating income 538.1 398.5 288.5 270.4 225.5 Non operating (expense) income, net(3) (20.7 ) (16.6 ) (4.5 ) 8.5 12.4 Income before provision for income taxes 517.4 381.9 284.0 278.9 237.9 Provision for income taxes 228.5 169.7 125.5 123.3 95.9 Net income $ 288.9 $ 212.2 $ 158.5 $ 155.6 $ 142.0 Earnings per share (1) Basic $ 1.88 $ 1.35 $ 0.98 $ 0.96 $ 0.84 Diluted $ 1.83 $ 1.32 $ 0.97 $ 0.95 $ 0.83 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 153.9 157.6 161.7 162.3 169.5 Diluted 157.5 160.2 163.0 164.3 171.7 Dividends declared per share $ 0.180 $ 0.180 $ 0.045 $ $ As of December 31, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Balance sheet data Total assets $ 630.8 $ 505.4 $ 398.3 $ 274.8 $ 296.2 Long term debt $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 Shareholders equity $ (327.0 ) $ (304.1 ) $ (282.5 ) $ (223.1 ) $ (192.6 ) (1) The 1998 data above includes revenue of $18.4 million and operating income of $4.2 million related to the Financial Information Services (FIS) business that was sold in July 1998.

These amounts were partially offset by interest income on invested cash of $2.3 million, $6.5 million and $2.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest expense and income was immaterial in 1999 and 1998. (4) The 2002 results of operations include revenue of $42.1 million, expenses of $42.8 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Factors Affecting Comparability The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the DB Business were allocated to New DB and all assets and liabilities of the Moodys Business were allocated to Moodys. The net indebtedness of Old DB at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moodys Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moodys as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old DB corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old DB at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old DB for periods prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 13 Table of Contents reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Moodys monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred revenue included approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively, related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. In addition, Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $22 million and $18 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. In 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moodys considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moodys has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $38.6 million at December 31, 2002. However, if Moodys profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $13 million of undistributed earnings of certain non U.S. subsidiaries, for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently managements intention to permanently re invest those earnings in the subsidiaries. If managements approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1.2 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moodys assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Companys conduct of its operations, and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Companys judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets. Based on its assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $3.4 million (pre tax) to write down a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Moodys employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long term return on pension plan assets, health care cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. Following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the Company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits. Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Salary growth assumptions are based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Long term return on pension plan assets is based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments), over a long term horizon. In 2003, for the purpose of determining net periodic pension expense, the Company expects to use a return on plan assets assumption of approximately 8.5%, which reflects return assumptions of approximately 9.5% for equity investments and approximately 5.1% for fixed income investments. The 2003 return assumption was reduced from 9.75% in 2002, principally reflecting lower expected returns on equity investments due to market weakness. This change in assumption will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2003. Stock Based Compensation In 2002 and prior years, the Company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options, and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements. The stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 will be expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. In addition, shares issued to participants in the Companys employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the Company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated impact of this change will be approximately $0.04 per diluted share in 2003. In future years, as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle (currently four years), the Company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2002, approximately $38 million was spent on such repurchases (after option 15 Table of Contents proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 13% of the Companys after tax cash flow before dividends, share repurchases and the KMV acquisition. The Companys 2001 spending was approximately $24 million, which was approximately 9% of after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Operating Segments The Company has historically operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business consists of KMV, acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, Moodys achieved revenue growth of 23.2% over the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business with global structured finance the largest growth driver, as well as strong double digit growth in the global research business. Revenue in the United States was $680.3 million in 2002, an increase of $119.6 million or 21.3% from $560.7 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $19.0 million, U.S. revenue increased 17.9% to $661.3 million. Strong growth in U.S. ratings revenue reflected higher issuance volumes in several market sectors, particularly structured finance and municipal bonds. Moodys international revenue was $343.0 million in 2002, an increase of 45.3% from $236.0 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $23.1 million, international revenue increased 35.6% to $319.9 million. This increase was primarily driven by strong growth in revenue from structured finance ratings in Europe and Japan, and global financial institutions. International research revenue grew 36% over 2001, and the consolidation of Korea Investors Service commencing in January 2002 also contributed to 2002 revenue growth. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 34% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. Excluding $12.2 million related to KMV, operating expenses would have been $273.1 million in 2002, a 14.0% year over year increase. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. Included in 2002 expenses are the following charges relating to Moodys KMV: $2.9 million of acquisition related charges, primarily for write offs of software and in process research and development; $1.6 million related to management transition; and $1.5 million related to the settlement of a patent licensing matter. 2002 and 2001 expense each included approximately $6.0 million of charitable contributions, mainly to The Moodys Foundation. Excluding these items and excluding all other expenses of KMV (totaling $19.7 16 Table of Contents million), SGA expenses increased 5.9% to $143.6 million in 2002, from $135.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, higher professional fees primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems, and higher legal fees due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. In addition, occupancy and travel related costs increased as a result of business expansion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The 2002 expense reflected $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Excluding these items, depreciation and amortization increased by $2.2 million or 14.8% year to year. Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amounts primarily reflected interest expense of $22.8 million in each year, related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt and interest income of $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. The Company expects the effective tax rate to decrease in the future as a greater portion of Moodys business migrates to lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $381.2 million in 2002, an increase of $107.4 million or 39.2% from $273.8 million in 2001. Strong growth was achieved in several U.S. market sectors, including residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, credit derivatives and asset backed securities. International structured finance revenue grew close to 60% versus 2001, reflecting strength in Europe, especially in credit derivatives and Japan, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $228.4 million in 2002, up 1.2% from $225.7 million in 2001. The number of issues in the U.S. corporate market declined about 17% in 2002 compared with the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. The effect of this decline on overall corporate finance revenue was tempered, however, by growth in bank loan ratings and relationship based revenue. European corporate finance generated double digit revenue growth versus the prior year despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service also contributed to revenue growth over the prior year. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $157.4 million in 2002, an increase of $26.7 million or 20.4% from $130.7 million in 2001. This reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in the U.S. in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Growth in issuer ratings and other relationship based revenue also contributed to the year over year growth. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance was strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. 17 Table of Contents Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to third party distributors contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses were, $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million, or 9.3% over 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other operating expense increases included consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products, due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Included in 2001expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, revenue for the prior Moodys Risk Management Services business grew 27.9% to $39.4 million in 2002. The revenue growth principally reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as more country specific models have been introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001. Excluding the $6.0 million of acquisition related, management transition and patent licensing charges described in Total Company Results above, and excluding all other KMV expenses of $31.9 million, expenses would have been $37.0 million in 2002, a 30.7% year over year increase. This increase primarily reflected higher compensation and benefit costs to support business expansion and increased consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets partially offset by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill from a prior acquisition pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Excluding the aforementioned $6.0 million of expenses, and $6.3 million of amortization expense related to the KMV acquisition, the Moodys KMV segment would have reported operating income of $7.0 million. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Company Results Total Moodys revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The Companys 2001 revenue performance reflected strong growth in revenue across all ratings groups as well as in global research and Moodys Risk Management Services. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of $131.8 million or 30.7% from $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities. Moodys international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001, an increase of 36.1% over $173.4 million in 2000. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double digit growth. International revenue at Moodys Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 18 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $239.6 million in 2001 grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in the worldwide structured finance business, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in two Argentine rating agencies, due to the currency devaluation and unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results; costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other expenses related to the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001; and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Moodys operating margin for 2001 was 50.0%, up from 47.9% in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Interest and other non operating expense was $16.6 million in 2001 compared with $4.5 million in 2000. The increase in 2001was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Companys $300 million private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.4% in 2001 compared to 44.2% in 2000. Net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared with $158.5 million in 2000. Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001, compared with $0.98 basic and $0.97 diluted in 2000. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $765.9 million in 2001, up 32.2% from $579.3 million in 2000. Strong double digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance, public finance and global research drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. Asset backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. European structured finance growth was very strong primarily due to credit derivatives, asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds, with robust refinancing activity. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000. Also contributing to revenue growth was Moodys Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9.0 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institutions and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $352.9 million in 2001, an increase of $80.5 million, or 29.6% from $272.4 million in 2000. Of this increase, $14.4 million was due to the Argentine investment write down, the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice, and charitable expenses, all as described above. The remaining increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in 19 Table of Contents global structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $11.5 million in 2001 versus $11.4 million in 2000. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $401.5 million in 2001 was up 35.9% from $295.5 million in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Moodys Risk Management Services Revenue for the Moodys Risk Management Services business was $30.8 million in 2001, an increase of 33.9% over 2000. This increase was driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for Moodys Risk Management Services were $28.3 million in 2001 compared with $24.8 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses and increased professional fees to support product development. Depreciation and amortization expense was $5.5 million in 2001 versus $5.2 million in 2000. Moodys Risk Management Services reported an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $7.0 million in 2000. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 18 countries outside the United States and over 85% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was billed in U.S. dollars. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $39.9 million at December 31, 2002, approximately $33.1 million was located outside the United States (with $18.0 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $334.8 million, $321.4 million, and $70.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase of $13.4 million in 2002 versus 2001 reflected growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Partially offsetting these factors were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million) and an increased investment in accounts receivable reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2002 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2003. The strength in 2002 ratings and research business volumes, as well as the acquisition of KMV, also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue over the prior year. The increase in other liabilities in 2002 reflected increased accruals for pension and other post retirement benefits, and tax exposures. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, a $174.6 million payment made to Old DB in 2000 in connection with the filing of an amended tax return for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods (as further described in Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Contingencies) and year to year growth in net 20 Table of Contents income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected the deferral of approximately $50 million of income tax payments noted above. Moodys accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.6 million higher than the prior year end. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year end 2001 were $47.6 million higher than the prior year end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $223.6 million, $30.0 million and $33.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002, $15.2 million for investments in international rating agencies in 2001 and $17.4 million for the acquisition of a financial software products company in 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally included investments in developing and upgrading computer hardware and software and purchases of office furnishings and equipment, were $18.1 million in 2002, $14.8 million in 2001 and $14.4 million in 2000. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($236.6) million, ($248.1) million and $79.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Share repurchases, employee stock option exercises, dividend payments and debt proceeds and repayments were the principal activities reflected in these amounts. Spending for share repurchases totaled $369.9 million in 2002, $267.6 million in 2001 and $71.8 million in 2000. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $54.0 million in 2002, $47.8 million in 2001 and $10.1 million in 2000. In addition, dividends paid were $27.8 million, $28.3 million and $7.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net proceeds from borrowings totaled $107.1 million in 2002 (as described below) and $104.5 million in 2000 representing net proceeds from the $300 million long term financing that was put in place at the time of the Companys spin off from Old DB, as described below. In addition, cash flow from financing activities in 2000 reflected cash distributions made to Old DB through the Distribution Date. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. Moodys has since borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management is considering pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2002, Moodys had $107.1 million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities, in addition to the $300 million of long term financing. Indebtedness In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowings outstanding of $76.1 million under the 5 year facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.64% per annum, and $31.0 million under the 364 day facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.73% per annum. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2002, such premium was 22 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points to 12.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2002. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility. In April 2002, Moodys used the Facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the KMV acquisition; amounts outstanding under the Facility were repaid in the second quarter of 2002. Since that time, Moodys has borrowed under the Facility to fund share repurchases 21 Table of Contents as noted above. Interest incurred under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which Moodys expects to complete by mid 2004. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Moodys repurchased 8.2 million shares at a total cost of $369.9 million, including 2.7 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2002, Moodys has repurchased 19.5 million shares at a total cost of $709.3 million, including 6.1 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years (in millions) Borrowings under credit facilities $ 107.1 $ 107.1 $ $ $ Notes payable 300.0 300.0 Operating lease obligations 53.2 13.5 23.1 15.1 1.5 Capital lease obligations 3.7 1.2 2.5 Purchase obligations (1) 11.4 6.4 3.8 1.2 Total $ 475.4 $ 128.2 $ 329.4 $ 16.3 $ 1.5 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 22 Table of Contents Outlook Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 31 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results following this section. Results of Operations Moodys results in 2002 and 2001, including growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, have exceeded the Companys long term financial targets, which are for low teens percent growth in Moodys Investors Service revenue and operating income, with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in mid teens percent growth in diluted earnings per share. The Company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets. For the Moodys KMV business, the Company expects revenue to grow to $200 million by 2005, with an operating margin (before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles) of greater than or equal to 20%. Moodys is providing its outlook for 2003 at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment, and the timing of such changes, creates important potential variance in the outlook. In Moodys Investors Service, moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in 2003 is anticipated despite the Companys expectation of a significant decline in the U.S. housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings, and lower growth in U.S. consumer spending affecting asset backed issuance. In global corporate finance, the Company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in 2003 despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the U.S. In the U.S. public finance sector, issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak. Nevertheless, because of an expected decline in refinancing activity, the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in 2003. Moodys also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business. Finally, healthy growth in the Moodys KMV business is expected. Moodys expenses for 2003 will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices, technology initiatives, product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. Moodys expects a slight decline in the operating margin in 2003 compared to the very high margin level in 2002, before the impact of expensing stock options (which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). Overall for 2003, Moodys expects that percent revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digits. With the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits, before the approximate $0.04 per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate $0.05 per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy (which is discussed in Note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Event). The Companys 2003 outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the United States, including the recently published SEC report on rating agencies pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Based on managements current assessment, Moodys does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the Companys 2003 outlook. However, changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry, possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies, could have an effect in the future. Cash Flow Moodys believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2003. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Companys approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends. Should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more tax efficient, the Company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies. In addition, as described above, the Company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during 2002 to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the KMV acquisition and share repurchase, and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. 23 Table of Contents In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2003, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 83% of Moodys revenue in 2002 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2002 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain U.S. sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, Ltd. (DBRS) are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. In its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets, the SEC has indicated that it is exploring whether (i) there are viable alternatives to the NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations and (ii) whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve NRSRO recognition. The recognition of DBRS as a NRSRO occurred in February 2003, after the release of the SECs report. Elimination of the NRSRO concept or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share for Moodys. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 24 Table of Contents and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In October 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a report that recommended changes in SEC regulation of rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considers a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In the report, the SEC stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to many participants in the European capital markets, including credit rating agencies. Depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted, such implementation guidelines may increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 25 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a 26 Table of Contents spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. Discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and The Dun Bradstreet Corporation entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement) pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities (IRI Liabilities) that may arise out of or in connection with the IRI action and (ii) to conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities, if any, become payable (the ACN Maximum Amount), and that The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to (i) any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion (but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval), and (ii) payment of related fees and expenses. For these purposes, financial viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such plan, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such plan, for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen merged with VNU N.V. Pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount, and VNU assumed ACNielsens liabilities under that agreement. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In 1999, NMR was acquired by VNU N.V. and VNU assumed NMRs liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. However, as between themselves, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made with respect to the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. 27 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2002, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Notice, the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1994, 1995 and 1996 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the IRS. In addition, the IRS recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notice (and including penalties), and were to prevail in its position, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. The Company estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $55 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, New DB has received a Preliminary Summary Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for 1996. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Report and were to prevail in this matter, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Moodys estimates that its share of the exposure to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $46 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph. Amortization Expense Deductions The IRS has requested from New DB documentation with respect to a transaction executed in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. It is possible that the IRS could ultimately challenge these deductions and that New DB could make payments to the IRS related to previously claimed deductions. In that event, Moodys would be required to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Management estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $89 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take with respect to assessments and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB 28 Table of Contents responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. A decision from the arbitration panel is expected in 2003. If NMR should prevail in the arbitration against IMS Health and, in turn, IMS Health should prevail against Old DB, then the Company believes that the additional liability of Old DB would be approximately $15 million, net of tax benefits. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys and New DB would each be responsible for one half of such amount, or approximately $7.5 million. The Company believes that the claim asserted against Old DB by IMS Health is without merit. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters. However, it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, which could result in material charges to Moodys future reported results. In addition, the cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $202 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. Dividends Since the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company has paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 2002 and 2001, and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moodys was a subsidiary of Old DB, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old DB shareholders. 29 Table of Contents In December 2002, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2003 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2003 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2003. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information As described above in Item 1 Business Background, the 2000 Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000 the Companys common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2003 was 5,073.

Audit Related Fees The aggregate fees billed for audit related services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Such services included acquisition due diligence reviews and related audits, employee benefit plan audits, internal control reviews, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. Tax Fees The aggregate fees billed for tax services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.6 million and $2.4 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed in 2001), respectively. Tax services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP principally related to expatriate tax services and tax consulting and compliance. Fees for tax consulting and compliance in 2001 principally were in connection with Moodys transition to an independent company after its spin off from Old DB. All Other Fees The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such fees principally related to data 30 Table of Contents entry services provided to the Companys ratings business. The Company does not anticipate that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will provide any future services in this area. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moodys business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Those statements appear in the section entitled Outlook under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 13 of this annual report on Form 10 K and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words believes, expects, anticipates and other words relating to Moodys views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this 10 Table of Contents suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996.

PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Information in response to this Item is set forth under the captions Common Stock Information and Dividends in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The Companys selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of such data in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million, $17.2 million, and $16.4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity. 11 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, amounts in millions, except per share data 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Results of operations(1) (4) Revenue $ 1,023.3 $ 796.7 $ 602.3 $ 564.2 $ 513.9 Expenses(2) 485.2 398.2 313.8 293.8 288.4 Operating income 538.1 398.5 288.5 270.4 225.5 Non operating (expense) income, net(3) (20.7 ) (16.6 ) (4.5 ) 8.5 12.4 Income before provision for income taxes 517.4 381.9 284.0 278.9 237.9 Provision for income taxes 228.5 169.7 125.5 123.3 95.9 Net income $ 288.9 $ 212.2 $ 158.5 $ 155.6 $ 142.0 Earnings per share (1) Basic $ 1.88 $ 1.35 $ 0.98 $ 0.96 $ 0.84 Diluted $ 1.83 $ 1.32 $ 0.97 $ 0.95 $ 0.83 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 153.9 157.6 161.7 162.3 169.5 Diluted 157.5 160.2 163.0 164.3 171.7 Dividends declared per share $ 0.180 $ 0.180 $ 0.045 $ $ As of December 31, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Balance sheet data Total assets $ 630.8 $ 505.4 $ 398.3 $ 274.8 $ 296.2 Long term debt $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 Shareholders equity $ (327.0 ) $ (304.1 ) $ (282.5 ) $ (223.1 ) $ (192.6 ) (1) The 1998 data above includes revenue of $18.4 million and operating income of $4.2 million related to the Financial Information Services (FIS) business that was sold in July 1998.

These amounts were partially offset by interest income on invested cash of $2.3 million, $6.5 million and $2.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest expense and income was immaterial in 1999 and 1998. (4) The 2002 results of operations include revenue of $42.1 million, expenses of $42.8 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Factors Affecting Comparability The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the DB Business were allocated to New DB and all assets and liabilities of the Moodys Business were allocated to Moodys. The net indebtedness of Old DB at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moodys Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moodys as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old DB corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old DB at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old DB for periods prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 13 Table of Contents reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Moodys monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred revenue included approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively, related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. In addition, Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $22 million and $18 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. In 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moodys considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moodys has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $38.6 million at December 31, 2002. However, if Moodys profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $13 million of undistributed earnings of certain non U.S. subsidiaries, for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently managements intention to permanently re invest those earnings in the subsidiaries. If managements approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1.2 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moodys assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Companys conduct of its operations, and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Companys judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets. Based on its assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $3.4 million (pre tax) to write down a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Moodys employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long term return on pension plan assets, health care cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. Following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the Company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits. Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Salary growth assumptions are based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Long term return on pension plan assets is based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments), over a long term horizon. In 2003, for the purpose of determining net periodic pension expense, the Company expects to use a return on plan assets assumption of approximately 8.5%, which reflects return assumptions of approximately 9.5% for equity investments and approximately 5.1% for fixed income investments. The 2003 return assumption was reduced from 9.75% in 2002, principally reflecting lower expected returns on equity investments due to market weakness. This change in assumption will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2003. Stock Based Compensation In 2002 and prior years, the Company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options, and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements. The stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 will be expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. In addition, shares issued to participants in the Companys employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the Company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated impact of this change will be approximately $0.04 per diluted share in 2003. In future years, as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle (currently four years), the Company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2002, approximately $38 million was spent on such repurchases (after option 15 Table of Contents proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 13% of the Companys after tax cash flow before dividends, share repurchases and the KMV acquisition. The Companys 2001 spending was approximately $24 million, which was approximately 9% of after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Operating Segments The Company has historically operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business consists of KMV, acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, Moodys achieved revenue growth of 23.2% over the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business with global structured finance the largest growth driver, as well as strong double digit growth in the global research business. Revenue in the United States was $680.3 million in 2002, an increase of $119.6 million or 21.3% from $560.7 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $19.0 million, U.S. revenue increased 17.9% to $661.3 million. Strong growth in U.S. ratings revenue reflected higher issuance volumes in several market sectors, particularly structured finance and municipal bonds. Moodys international revenue was $343.0 million in 2002, an increase of 45.3% from $236.0 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $23.1 million, international revenue increased 35.6% to $319.9 million. This increase was primarily driven by strong growth in revenue from structured finance ratings in Europe and Japan, and global financial institutions. International research revenue grew 36% over 2001, and the consolidation of Korea Investors Service commencing in January 2002 also contributed to 2002 revenue growth. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 34% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. Excluding $12.2 million related to KMV, operating expenses would have been $273.1 million in 2002, a 14.0% year over year increase. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. Included in 2002 expenses are the following charges relating to Moodys KMV: $2.9 million of acquisition related charges, primarily for write offs of software and in process research and development; $1.6 million related to management transition; and $1.5 million related to the settlement of a patent licensing matter. 2002 and 2001 expense each included approximately $6.0 million of charitable contributions, mainly to The Moodys Foundation. Excluding these items and excluding all other expenses of KMV (totaling $19.7 16 Table of Contents million), SGA expenses increased 5.9% to $143.6 million in 2002, from $135.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, higher professional fees primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems, and higher legal fees due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. In addition, occupancy and travel related costs increased as a result of business expansion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The 2002 expense reflected $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Excluding these items, depreciation and amortization increased by $2.2 million or 14.8% year to year. Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amounts primarily reflected interest expense of $22.8 million in each year, related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt and interest income of $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. The Company expects the effective tax rate to decrease in the future as a greater portion of Moodys business migrates to lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $381.2 million in 2002, an increase of $107.4 million or 39.2% from $273.8 million in 2001. Strong growth was achieved in several U.S. market sectors, including residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, credit derivatives and asset backed securities. International structured finance revenue grew close to 60% versus 2001, reflecting strength in Europe, especially in credit derivatives and Japan, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $228.4 million in 2002, up 1.2% from $225.7 million in 2001. The number of issues in the U.S. corporate market declined about 17% in 2002 compared with the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. The effect of this decline on overall corporate finance revenue was tempered, however, by growth in bank loan ratings and relationship based revenue. European corporate finance generated double digit revenue growth versus the prior year despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service also contributed to revenue growth over the prior year. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $157.4 million in 2002, an increase of $26.7 million or 20.4% from $130.7 million in 2001. This reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in the U.S. in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Growth in issuer ratings and other relationship based revenue also contributed to the year over year growth. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance was strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. 17 Table of Contents Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to third party distributors contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses were, $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million, or 9.3% over 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other operating expense increases included consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products, due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Included in 2001expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, revenue for the prior Moodys Risk Management Services business grew 27.9% to $39.4 million in 2002. The revenue growth principally reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as more country specific models have been introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001. Excluding the $6.0 million of acquisition related, management transition and patent licensing charges described in Total Company Results above, and excluding all other KMV expenses of $31.9 million, expenses would have been $37.0 million in 2002, a 30.7% year over year increase. This increase primarily reflected higher compensation and benefit costs to support business expansion and increased consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets partially offset by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill from a prior acquisition pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Excluding the aforementioned $6.0 million of expenses, and $6.3 million of amortization expense related to the KMV acquisition, the Moodys KMV segment would have reported operating income of $7.0 million. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Company Results Total Moodys revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The Companys 2001 revenue performance reflected strong growth in revenue across all ratings groups as well as in global research and Moodys Risk Management Services. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of $131.8 million or 30.7% from $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities. Moodys international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001, an increase of 36.1% over $173.4 million in 2000. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double digit growth. International revenue at Moodys Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 18 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $239.6 million in 2001 grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in the worldwide structured finance business, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in two Argentine rating agencies, due to the currency devaluation and unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results; costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other expenses related to the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001; and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Moodys operating margin for 2001 was 50.0%, up from 47.9% in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Interest and other non operating expense was $16.6 million in 2001 compared with $4.5 million in 2000. The increase in 2001was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Companys $300 million private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.4% in 2001 compared to 44.2% in 2000. Net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared with $158.5 million in 2000. Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001, compared with $0.98 basic and $0.97 diluted in 2000. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $765.9 million in 2001, up 32.2% from $579.3 million in 2000. Strong double digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance, public finance and global research drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. Asset backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. European structured finance growth was very strong primarily due to credit derivatives, asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds, with robust refinancing activity. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000. Also contributing to revenue growth was Moodys Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9.0 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institutions and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $352.9 million in 2001, an increase of $80.5 million, or 29.6% from $272.4 million in 2000. Of this increase, $14.4 million was due to the Argentine investment write down, the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice, and charitable expenses, all as described above. The remaining increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in 19 Table of Contents global structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $11.5 million in 2001 versus $11.4 million in 2000. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $401.5 million in 2001 was up 35.9% from $295.5 million in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Moodys Risk Management Services Revenue for the Moodys Risk Management Services business was $30.8 million in 2001, an increase of 33.9% over 2000. This increase was driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for Moodys Risk Management Services were $28.3 million in 2001 compared with $24.8 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses and increased professional fees to support product development. Depreciation and amortization expense was $5.5 million in 2001 versus $5.2 million in 2000. Moodys Risk Management Services reported an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $7.0 million in 2000. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 18 countries outside the United States and over 85% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was billed in U.S. dollars. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $39.9 million at December 31, 2002, approximately $33.1 million was located outside the United States (with $18.0 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $334.8 million, $321.4 million, and $70.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase of $13.4 million in 2002 versus 2001 reflected growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Partially offsetting these factors were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million) and an increased investment in accounts receivable reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2002 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2003. The strength in 2002 ratings and research business volumes, as well as the acquisition of KMV, also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue over the prior year. The increase in other liabilities in 2002 reflected increased accruals for pension and other post retirement benefits, and tax exposures. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, a $174.6 million payment made to Old DB in 2000 in connection with the filing of an amended tax return for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods (as further described in Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Contingencies) and year to year growth in net 20 Table of Contents income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected the deferral of approximately $50 million of income tax payments noted above. Moodys accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.6 million higher than the prior year end. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year end 2001 were $47.6 million higher than the prior year end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $223.6 million, $30.0 million and $33.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002, $15.2 million for investments in international rating agencies in 2001 and $17.4 million for the acquisition of a financial software products company in 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally included investments in developing and upgrading computer hardware and software and purchases of office furnishings and equipment, were $18.1 million in 2002, $14.8 million in 2001 and $14.4 million in 2000. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($236.6) million, ($248.1) million and $79.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Share repurchases, employee stock option exercises, dividend payments and debt proceeds and repayments were the principal activities reflected in these amounts. Spending for share repurchases totaled $369.9 million in 2002, $267.6 million in 2001 and $71.8 million in 2000. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $54.0 million in 2002, $47.8 million in 2001 and $10.1 million in 2000. In addition, dividends paid were $27.8 million, $28.3 million and $7.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net proceeds from borrowings totaled $107.1 million in 2002 (as described below) and $104.5 million in 2000 representing net proceeds from the $300 million long term financing that was put in place at the time of the Companys spin off from Old DB, as described below. In addition, cash flow from financing activities in 2000 reflected cash distributions made to Old DB through the Distribution Date. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. Moodys has since borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management is considering pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2002, Moodys had $107.1 million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities, in addition to the $300 million of long term financing. Indebtedness In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowings outstanding of $76.1 million under the 5 year facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.64% per annum, and $31.0 million under the 364 day facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.73% per annum. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2002, such premium was 22 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points to 12.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2002. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility. In April 2002, Moodys used the Facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the KMV acquisition; amounts outstanding under the Facility were repaid in the second quarter of 2002. Since that time, Moodys has borrowed under the Facility to fund share repurchases 21 Table of Contents as noted above. Interest incurred under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which Moodys expects to complete by mid 2004. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Moodys repurchased 8.2 million shares at a total cost of $369.9 million, including 2.7 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2002, Moodys has repurchased 19.5 million shares at a total cost of $709.3 million, including 6.1 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years (in millions) Borrowings under credit facilities $ 107.1 $ 107.1 $ $ $ Notes payable 300.0 300.0 Operating lease obligations 53.2 13.5 23.1 15.1 1.5 Capital lease obligations 3.7 1.2 2.5 Purchase obligations (1) 11.4 6.4 3.8 1.2 Total $ 475.4 $ 128.2 $ 329.4 $ 16.3 $ 1.5 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 22 Table of Contents Outlook Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 31 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results following this section. Results of Operations Moodys results in 2002 and 2001, including growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, have exceeded the Companys long term financial targets, which are for low teens percent growth in Moodys Investors Service revenue and operating income, with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in mid teens percent growth in diluted earnings per share. The Company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets. For the Moodys KMV business, the Company expects revenue to grow to $200 million by 2005, with an operating margin (before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles) of greater than or equal to 20%. Moodys is providing its outlook for 2003 at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment, and the timing of such changes, creates important potential variance in the outlook. In Moodys Investors Service, moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in 2003 is anticipated despite the Companys expectation of a significant decline in the U.S. housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings, and lower growth in U.S. consumer spending affecting asset backed issuance. In global corporate finance, the Company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in 2003 despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the U.S. In the U.S. public finance sector, issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak. Nevertheless, because of an expected decline in refinancing activity, the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in 2003. Moodys also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business. Finally, healthy growth in the Moodys KMV business is expected. Moodys expenses for 2003 will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices, technology initiatives, product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. Moodys expects a slight decline in the operating margin in 2003 compared to the very high margin level in 2002, before the impact of expensing stock options (which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). Overall for 2003, Moodys expects that percent revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digits. With the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits, before the approximate $0.04 per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate $0.05 per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy (which is discussed in Note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Event). The Companys 2003 outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the United States, including the recently published SEC report on rating agencies pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Based on managements current assessment, Moodys does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the Companys 2003 outlook. However, changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry, possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies, could have an effect in the future. Cash Flow Moodys believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2003. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Companys approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends. Should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more tax efficient, the Company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies. In addition, as described above, the Company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during 2002 to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the KMV acquisition and share repurchase, and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. 23 Table of Contents In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2003, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 83% of Moodys revenue in 2002 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2002 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain U.S. sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, Ltd. (DBRS) are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. In its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets, the SEC has indicated that it is exploring whether (i) there are viable alternatives to the NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations and (ii) whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve NRSRO recognition. The recognition of DBRS as a NRSRO occurred in February 2003, after the release of the SECs report. Elimination of the NRSRO concept or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share for Moodys. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 24 Table of Contents and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In October 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a report that recommended changes in SEC regulation of rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considers a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In the report, the SEC stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to many participants in the European capital markets, including credit rating agencies. Depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted, such implementation guidelines may increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 25 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a 26 Table of Contents spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. Discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and The Dun Bradstreet Corporation entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement) pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities (IRI Liabilities) that may arise out of or in connection with the IRI action and (ii) to conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities, if any, become payable (the ACN Maximum Amount), and that The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to (i) any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion (but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval), and (ii) payment of related fees and expenses. For these purposes, financial viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such plan, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such plan, for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen merged with VNU N.V. Pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount, and VNU assumed ACNielsens liabilities under that agreement. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In 1999, NMR was acquired by VNU N.V. and VNU assumed NMRs liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. However, as between themselves, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made with respect to the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. 27 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2002, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Notice, the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1994, 1995 and 1996 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the IRS. In addition, the IRS recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notice (and including penalties), and were to prevail in its position, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. The Company estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $55 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, New DB has received a Preliminary Summary Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for 1996. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Report and were to prevail in this matter, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Moodys estimates that its share of the exposure to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $46 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph. Amortization Expense Deductions The IRS has requested from New DB documentation with respect to a transaction executed in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. It is possible that the IRS could ultimately challenge these deductions and that New DB could make payments to the IRS related to previously claimed deductions. In that event, Moodys would be required to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Management estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $89 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take with respect to assessments and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB 28 Table of Contents responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. A decision from the arbitration panel is expected in 2003. If NMR should prevail in the arbitration against IMS Health and, in turn, IMS Health should prevail against Old DB, then the Company believes that the additional liability of Old DB would be approximately $15 million, net of tax benefits. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys and New DB would each be responsible for one half of such amount, or approximately $7.5 million. The Company believes that the claim asserted against Old DB by IMS Health is without merit. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters. However, it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, which could result in material charges to Moodys future reported results. In addition, the cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $202 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. Dividends Since the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company has paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 2002 and 2001, and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moodys was a subsidiary of Old DB, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old DB shareholders. 29 Table of Contents In December 2002, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2003 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2003 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2003. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information As described above in Item 1 Business Background, the 2000 Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000 the Companys common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2003 was 5,073.

Audit Related Fees The aggregate fees billed for audit related services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Such services included acquisition due diligence reviews and related audits, employee benefit plan audits, internal control reviews, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. Tax Fees The aggregate fees billed for tax services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.6 million and $2.4 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed in 2001), respectively. Tax services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP principally related to expatriate tax services and tax consulting and compliance. Fees for tax consulting and compliance in 2001 principally were in connection with Moodys transition to an independent company after its spin off from Old DB. All Other Fees The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such fees principally related to data 30 Table of Contents entry services provided to the Companys ratings business. The Company does not anticipate that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will provide any future services in this area. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moodys business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Those statements appear in the section entitled Outlook under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 13 of this annual report on Form 10 K and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words believes, expects, anticipates and other words relating to Moodys views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of such data in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million, $17.2 million, and $16.4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity. 11 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, amounts in millions, except per share data 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Results of operations(1) (4) Revenue $ 1,023.3 $ 796.7 $ 602.3 $ 564.2 $ 513.9 Expenses(2) 485.2 398.2 313.8 293.8 288.4 Operating income 538.1 398.5 288.5 270.4 225.5 Non operating (expense) income, net(3) (20.7 ) (16.6 ) (4.5 ) 8.5 12.4 Income before provision for income taxes 517.4 381.9 284.0 278.9 237.9 Provision for income taxes 228.5 169.7 125.5 123.3 95.9 Net income $ 288.9 $ 212.2 $ 158.5 $ 155.6 $ 142.0 Earnings per share (1) Basic $ 1.88 $ 1.35 $ 0.98 $ 0.96 $ 0.84 Diluted $ 1.83 $ 1.32 $ 0.97 $ 0.95 $ 0.83 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 153.9 157.6 161.7 162.3 169.5 Diluted 157.5 160.2 163.0 164.3 171.7 Dividends declared per share $ 0.180 $ 0.180 $ 0.045 $ $ As of December 31, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Balance sheet data Total assets $ 630.8 $ 505.4 $ 398.3 $ 274.8 $ 296.2 Long term debt $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 Shareholders equity $ (327.0 ) $ (304.1 ) $ (282.5 ) $ (223.1 ) $ (192.6 ) (1) The 1998 data above includes revenue of $18.4 million and operating income of $4.2 million related to the Financial Information Services (FIS) business that was sold in July 1998.

These amounts were partially offset by interest income on invested cash of $2.3 million, $6.5 million and $2.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest expense and income was immaterial in 1999 and 1998. (4) The 2002 results of operations include revenue of $42.1 million, expenses of $42.8 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Factors Affecting Comparability The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the DB Business were allocated to New DB and all assets and liabilities of the Moodys Business were allocated to Moodys. The net indebtedness of Old DB at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moodys Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moodys as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old DB corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old DB at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old DB for periods prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 13 Table of Contents reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Moodys monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred revenue included approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively, related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. In addition, Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $22 million and $18 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. In 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moodys considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moodys has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $38.6 million at December 31, 2002. However, if Moodys profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $13 million of undistributed earnings of certain non U.S. subsidiaries, for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently managements intention to permanently re invest those earnings in the subsidiaries. If managements approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1.2 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moodys assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Companys conduct of its operations, and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Companys judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets. Based on its assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $3.4 million (pre tax) to write down a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Moodys employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long term return on pension plan assets, health care cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. Following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the Company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits. Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Salary growth assumptions are based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Long term return on pension plan assets is based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments), over a long term horizon. In 2003, for the purpose of determining net periodic pension expense, the Company expects to use a return on plan assets assumption of approximately 8.5%, which reflects return assumptions of approximately 9.5% for equity investments and approximately 5.1% for fixed income investments. The 2003 return assumption was reduced from 9.75% in 2002, principally reflecting lower expected returns on equity investments due to market weakness. This change in assumption will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2003. Stock Based Compensation In 2002 and prior years, the Company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options, and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements. The stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 will be expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. In addition, shares issued to participants in the Companys employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the Company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated impact of this change will be approximately $0.04 per diluted share in 2003. In future years, as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle (currently four years), the Company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2002, approximately $38 million was spent on such repurchases (after option 15 Table of Contents proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 13% of the Companys after tax cash flow before dividends, share repurchases and the KMV acquisition. The Companys 2001 spending was approximately $24 million, which was approximately 9% of after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Operating Segments The Company has historically operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business consists of KMV, acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, Moodys achieved revenue growth of 23.2% over the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business with global structured finance the largest growth driver, as well as strong double digit growth in the global research business. Revenue in the United States was $680.3 million in 2002, an increase of $119.6 million or 21.3% from $560.7 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $19.0 million, U.S. revenue increased 17.9% to $661.3 million. Strong growth in U.S. ratings revenue reflected higher issuance volumes in several market sectors, particularly structured finance and municipal bonds. Moodys international revenue was $343.0 million in 2002, an increase of 45.3% from $236.0 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $23.1 million, international revenue increased 35.6% to $319.9 million. This increase was primarily driven by strong growth in revenue from structured finance ratings in Europe and Japan, and global financial institutions. International research revenue grew 36% over 2001, and the consolidation of Korea Investors Service commencing in January 2002 also contributed to 2002 revenue growth. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 34% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. Excluding $12.2 million related to KMV, operating expenses would have been $273.1 million in 2002, a 14.0% year over year increase. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. Included in 2002 expenses are the following charges relating to Moodys KMV: $2.9 million of acquisition related charges, primarily for write offs of software and in process research and development; $1.6 million related to management transition; and $1.5 million related to the settlement of a patent licensing matter. 2002 and 2001 expense each included approximately $6.0 million of charitable contributions, mainly to The Moodys Foundation. Excluding these items and excluding all other expenses of KMV (totaling $19.7 16 Table of Contents million), SGA expenses increased 5.9% to $143.6 million in 2002, from $135.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, higher professional fees primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems, and higher legal fees due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. In addition, occupancy and travel related costs increased as a result of business expansion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The 2002 expense reflected $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Excluding these items, depreciation and amortization increased by $2.2 million or 14.8% year to year. Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amounts primarily reflected interest expense of $22.8 million in each year, related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt and interest income of $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. The Company expects the effective tax rate to decrease in the future as a greater portion of Moodys business migrates to lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $381.2 million in 2002, an increase of $107.4 million or 39.2% from $273.8 million in 2001. Strong growth was achieved in several U.S. market sectors, including residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, credit derivatives and asset backed securities. International structured finance revenue grew close to 60% versus 2001, reflecting strength in Europe, especially in credit derivatives and Japan, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $228.4 million in 2002, up 1.2% from $225.7 million in 2001. The number of issues in the U.S. corporate market declined about 17% in 2002 compared with the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. The effect of this decline on overall corporate finance revenue was tempered, however, by growth in bank loan ratings and relationship based revenue. European corporate finance generated double digit revenue growth versus the prior year despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service also contributed to revenue growth over the prior year. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $157.4 million in 2002, an increase of $26.7 million or 20.4% from $130.7 million in 2001. This reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in the U.S. in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Growth in issuer ratings and other relationship based revenue also contributed to the year over year growth. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance was strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. 17 Table of Contents Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to third party distributors contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses were, $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million, or 9.3% over 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other operating expense increases included consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products, due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Included in 2001expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, revenue for the prior Moodys Risk Management Services business grew 27.9% to $39.4 million in 2002. The revenue growth principally reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as more country specific models have been introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001. Excluding the $6.0 million of acquisition related, management transition and patent licensing charges described in Total Company Results above, and excluding all other KMV expenses of $31.9 million, expenses would have been $37.0 million in 2002, a 30.7% year over year increase. This increase primarily reflected higher compensation and benefit costs to support business expansion and increased consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets partially offset by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill from a prior acquisition pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Excluding the aforementioned $6.0 million of expenses, and $6.3 million of amortization expense related to the KMV acquisition, the Moodys KMV segment would have reported operating income of $7.0 million. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Company Results Total Moodys revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The Companys 2001 revenue performance reflected strong growth in revenue across all ratings groups as well as in global research and Moodys Risk Management Services. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of $131.8 million or 30.7% from $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities. Moodys international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001, an increase of 36.1% over $173.4 million in 2000. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double digit growth. International revenue at Moodys Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 18 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $239.6 million in 2001 grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in the worldwide structured finance business, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in two Argentine rating agencies, due to the currency devaluation and unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results; costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other expenses related to the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001; and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Moodys operating margin for 2001 was 50.0%, up from 47.9% in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Interest and other non operating expense was $16.6 million in 2001 compared with $4.5 million in 2000. The increase in 2001was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Companys $300 million private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.4% in 2001 compared to 44.2% in 2000. Net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared with $158.5 million in 2000. Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001, compared with $0.98 basic and $0.97 diluted in 2000. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $765.9 million in 2001, up 32.2% from $579.3 million in 2000. Strong double digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance, public finance and global research drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. Asset backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. European structured finance growth was very strong primarily due to credit derivatives, asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds, with robust refinancing activity. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000. Also contributing to revenue growth was Moodys Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9.0 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institutions and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $352.9 million in 2001, an increase of $80.5 million, or 29.6% from $272.4 million in 2000. Of this increase, $14.4 million was due to the Argentine investment write down, the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice, and charitable expenses, all as described above. The remaining increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in 19 Table of Contents global structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $11.5 million in 2001 versus $11.4 million in 2000. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $401.5 million in 2001 was up 35.9% from $295.5 million in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Moodys Risk Management Services Revenue for the Moodys Risk Management Services business was $30.8 million in 2001, an increase of 33.9% over 2000. This increase was driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for Moodys Risk Management Services were $28.3 million in 2001 compared with $24.8 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses and increased professional fees to support product development. Depreciation and amortization expense was $5.5 million in 2001 versus $5.2 million in 2000. Moodys Risk Management Services reported an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $7.0 million in 2000. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 18 countries outside the United States and over 85% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was billed in U.S. dollars. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $39.9 million at December 31, 2002, approximately $33.1 million was located outside the United States (with $18.0 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $334.8 million, $321.4 million, and $70.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase of $13.4 million in 2002 versus 2001 reflected growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Partially offsetting these factors were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million) and an increased investment in accounts receivable reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2002 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2003. The strength in 2002 ratings and research business volumes, as well as the acquisition of KMV, also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue over the prior year. The increase in other liabilities in 2002 reflected increased accruals for pension and other post retirement benefits, and tax exposures. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, a $174.6 million payment made to Old DB in 2000 in connection with the filing of an amended tax return for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods (as further described in Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Contingencies) and year to year growth in net 20 Table of Contents income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected the deferral of approximately $50 million of income tax payments noted above. Moodys accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.6 million higher than the prior year end. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year end 2001 were $47.6 million higher than the prior year end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $223.6 million, $30.0 million and $33.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002, $15.2 million for investments in international rating agencies in 2001 and $17.4 million for the acquisition of a financial software products company in 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally included investments in developing and upgrading computer hardware and software and purchases of office furnishings and equipment, were $18.1 million in 2002, $14.8 million in 2001 and $14.4 million in 2000. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($236.6) million, ($248.1) million and $79.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Share repurchases, employee stock option exercises, dividend payments and debt proceeds and repayments were the principal activities reflected in these amounts. Spending for share repurchases totaled $369.9 million in 2002, $267.6 million in 2001 and $71.8 million in 2000. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $54.0 million in 2002, $47.8 million in 2001 and $10.1 million in 2000. In addition, dividends paid were $27.8 million, $28.3 million and $7.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net proceeds from borrowings totaled $107.1 million in 2002 (as described below) and $104.5 million in 2000 representing net proceeds from the $300 million long term financing that was put in place at the time of the Companys spin off from Old DB, as described below. In addition, cash flow from financing activities in 2000 reflected cash distributions made to Old DB through the Distribution Date. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. Moodys has since borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management is considering pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2002, Moodys had $107.1 million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities, in addition to the $300 million of long term financing. Indebtedness In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowings outstanding of $76.1 million under the 5 year facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.64% per annum, and $31.0 million under the 364 day facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.73% per annum. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2002, such premium was 22 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points to 12.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2002. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility. In April 2002, Moodys used the Facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the KMV acquisition; amounts outstanding under the Facility were repaid in the second quarter of 2002. Since that time, Moodys has borrowed under the Facility to fund share repurchases 21 Table of Contents as noted above. Interest incurred under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which Moodys expects to complete by mid 2004. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Moodys repurchased 8.2 million shares at a total cost of $369.9 million, including 2.7 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2002, Moodys has repurchased 19.5 million shares at a total cost of $709.3 million, including 6.1 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years (in millions) Borrowings under credit facilities $ 107.1 $ 107.1 $ $ $ Notes payable 300.0 300.0 Operating lease obligations 53.2 13.5 23.1 15.1 1.5 Capital lease obligations 3.7 1.2 2.5 Purchase obligations (1) 11.4 6.4 3.8 1.2 Total $ 475.4 $ 128.2 $ 329.4 $ 16.3 $ 1.5 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 22 Table of Contents Outlook Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 31 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results following this section. Results of Operations Moodys results in 2002 and 2001, including growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, have exceeded the Companys long term financial targets, which are for low teens percent growth in Moodys Investors Service revenue and operating income, with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in mid teens percent growth in diluted earnings per share. The Company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets. For the Moodys KMV business, the Company expects revenue to grow to $200 million by 2005, with an operating margin (before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles) of greater than or equal to 20%. Moodys is providing its outlook for 2003 at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment, and the timing of such changes, creates important potential variance in the outlook. In Moodys Investors Service, moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in 2003 is anticipated despite the Companys expectation of a significant decline in the U.S. housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings, and lower growth in U.S. consumer spending affecting asset backed issuance. In global corporate finance, the Company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in 2003 despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the U.S. In the U.S. public finance sector, issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak. Nevertheless, because of an expected decline in refinancing activity, the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in 2003. Moodys also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business. Finally, healthy growth in the Moodys KMV business is expected. Moodys expenses for 2003 will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices, technology initiatives, product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. Moodys expects a slight decline in the operating margin in 2003 compared to the very high margin level in 2002, before the impact of expensing stock options (which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). Overall for 2003, Moodys expects that percent revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digits. With the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits, before the approximate $0.04 per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate $0.05 per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy (which is discussed in Note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Event). The Companys 2003 outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the United States, including the recently published SEC report on rating agencies pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Based on managements current assessment, Moodys does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the Companys 2003 outlook. However, changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry, possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies, could have an effect in the future. Cash Flow Moodys believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2003. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Companys approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends. Should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more tax efficient, the Company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies. In addition, as described above, the Company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during 2002 to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the KMV acquisition and share repurchase, and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. 23 Table of Contents In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2003, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 83% of Moodys revenue in 2002 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2002 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain U.S. sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, Ltd. (DBRS) are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. In its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets, the SEC has indicated that it is exploring whether (i) there are viable alternatives to the NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations and (ii) whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve NRSRO recognition. The recognition of DBRS as a NRSRO occurred in February 2003, after the release of the SECs report. Elimination of the NRSRO concept or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share for Moodys. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 24 Table of Contents and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In October 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a report that recommended changes in SEC regulation of rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considers a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In the report, the SEC stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to many participants in the European capital markets, including credit rating agencies. Depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted, such implementation guidelines may increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 25 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a 26 Table of Contents spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. Discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and The Dun Bradstreet Corporation entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement) pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities (IRI Liabilities) that may arise out of or in connection with the IRI action and (ii) to conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities, if any, become payable (the ACN Maximum Amount), and that The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to (i) any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion (but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval), and (ii) payment of related fees and expenses. For these purposes, financial viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such plan, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such plan, for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen merged with VNU N.V. Pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount, and VNU assumed ACNielsens liabilities under that agreement. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In 1999, NMR was acquired by VNU N.V. and VNU assumed NMRs liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. However, as between themselves, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made with respect to the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. 27 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2002, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Notice, the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1994, 1995 and 1996 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the IRS. In addition, the IRS recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notice (and including penalties), and were to prevail in its position, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. The Company estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $55 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, New DB has received a Preliminary Summary Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for 1996. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Report and were to prevail in this matter, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Moodys estimates that its share of the exposure to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $46 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph. Amortization Expense Deductions The IRS has requested from New DB documentation with respect to a transaction executed in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. It is possible that the IRS could ultimately challenge these deductions and that New DB could make payments to the IRS related to previously claimed deductions. In that event, Moodys would be required to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Management estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $89 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take with respect to assessments and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB 28 Table of Contents responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. A decision from the arbitration panel is expected in 2003. If NMR should prevail in the arbitration against IMS Health and, in turn, IMS Health should prevail against Old DB, then the Company believes that the additional liability of Old DB would be approximately $15 million, net of tax benefits. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys and New DB would each be responsible for one half of such amount, or approximately $7.5 million. The Company believes that the claim asserted against Old DB by IMS Health is without merit. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters. However, it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, which could result in material charges to Moodys future reported results. In addition, the cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $202 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. Dividends Since the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company has paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 2002 and 2001, and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moodys was a subsidiary of Old DB, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old DB shareholders. 29 Table of Contents In December 2002, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2003 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2003 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2003. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information As described above in Item 1 Business Background, the 2000 Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000 the Companys common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2003 was 5,073. Price Per Share Dividends Paid High Low Per Share From October 3, 2000 through December 31, 2000 $ 28.88 $ 22.63 $ 0.045 2001: First quarter $ 29.11 $ 25.49 $ 0.045 Second quarter $ 34.85 $ 26.17 $ 0.045 Third quarter $ 37.00 $ 30.60 $ 0.045 Fourth quarter $ 41.10 $ 31.46 $ 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2001 $ 41.10 $ 25.49 $ 0.180 2002: First quarter $ 42.00 $ 35.80 $ 0.045 Second quarter $ 51.74 $ 39.94 $ 0.045 Third quarter $ 52.40 $ 41.00 $ 0.045 Fourth quarter $ 50.48 $ 39.80 $ 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2002 $ 52.40 $ 35.80 $ 0.180 Fees of Independent Accountants Audit Fees The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of the Companys annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and for the review of the financial statements included in the Companys Reports on Forms 10 Q and 8 K, and for statutory audits of non U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $0.9 million (including $0.3 million incurred but not billed in 2002) and $0.6 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Audit Related Fees The aggregate fees billed for audit related services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Such services included acquisition due diligence reviews and related audits, employee benefit plan audits, internal control reviews, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. Tax Fees The aggregate fees billed for tax services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.6 million and $2.4 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed in 2001), respectively. Tax services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP principally related to expatriate tax services and tax consulting and compliance. Fees for tax consulting and compliance in 2001 principally were in connection with Moodys transition to an independent company after its spin off from Old DB. All Other Fees The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such fees principally related to data 30 Table of Contents entry services provided to the Companys ratings business. The Company does not anticipate that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will provide any future services in this area. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moodys business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Those statements appear in the section entitled Outlook under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 13 of this annual report on Form 10 K and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words believes, expects, anticipates and other words relating to Moodys views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Factors Affecting Comparability The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the DB Business were allocated to New DB and all assets and liabilities of the Moodys Business were allocated to Moodys. The net indebtedness of Old DB at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moodys Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moodys as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old DB corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old DB at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old DB for periods prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 13 Table of Contents reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Moodys monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred revenue included approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively, related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. In addition, Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $22 million and $18 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. In 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moodys considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moodys has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $38.6 million at December 31, 2002. However, if Moodys profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $13 million of undistributed earnings of certain non U.S. subsidiaries, for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently managements intention to permanently re invest those earnings in the subsidiaries. If managements approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1.2 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moodys assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Companys conduct of its operations, and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Companys judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets. Based on its assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $3.4 million (pre tax) to write down a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Moodys employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long term return on pension plan assets, health care cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. Following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the Company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits. Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Salary growth assumptions are based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Long term return on pension plan assets is based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments), over a long term horizon. In 2003, for the purpose of determining net periodic pension expense, the Company expects to use a return on plan assets assumption of approximately 8.5%, which reflects return assumptions of approximately 9.5% for equity investments and approximately 5.1% for fixed income investments. The 2003 return assumption was reduced from 9.75% in 2002, principally reflecting lower expected returns on equity investments due to market weakness. This change in assumption will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2003. Stock Based Compensation In 2002 and prior years, the Company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options, and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements. The stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 will be expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. In addition, shares issued to participants in the Companys employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the Company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated impact of this change will be approximately $0.04 per diluted share in 2003. In future years, as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle (currently four years), the Company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2002, approximately $38 million was spent on such repurchases (after option 15 Table of Contents proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 13% of the Companys after tax cash flow before dividends, share repurchases and the KMV acquisition. The Companys 2001 spending was approximately $24 million, which was approximately 9% of after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Operating Segments The Company has historically operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business consists of KMV, acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, Moodys achieved revenue growth of 23.2% over the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business with global structured finance the largest growth driver, as well as strong double digit growth in the global research business. Revenue in the United States was $680.3 million in 2002, an increase of $119.6 million or 21.3% from $560.7 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $19.0 million, U.S. revenue increased 17.9% to $661.3 million. Strong growth in U.S. ratings revenue reflected higher issuance volumes in several market sectors, particularly structured finance and municipal bonds. Moodys international revenue was $343.0 million in 2002, an increase of 45.3% from $236.0 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $23.1 million, international revenue increased 35.6% to $319.9 million. This increase was primarily driven by strong growth in revenue from structured finance ratings in Europe and Japan, and global financial institutions. International research revenue grew 36% over 2001, and the consolidation of Korea Investors Service commencing in January 2002 also contributed to 2002 revenue growth. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 34% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. Excluding $12.2 million related to KMV, operating expenses would have been $273.1 million in 2002, a 14.0% year over year increase. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. Included in 2002 expenses are the following charges relating to Moodys KMV: $2.9 million of acquisition related charges, primarily for write offs of software and in process research and development; $1.6 million related to management transition; and $1.5 million related to the settlement of a patent licensing matter. 2002 and 2001 expense each included approximately $6.0 million of charitable contributions, mainly to The Moodys Foundation. Excluding these items and excluding all other expenses of KMV (totaling $19.7 16 Table of Contents million), SGA expenses increased 5.9% to $143.6 million in 2002, from $135.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, higher professional fees primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems, and higher legal fees due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. In addition, occupancy and travel related costs increased as a result of business expansion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The 2002 expense reflected $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Excluding these items, depreciation and amortization increased by $2.2 million or 14.8% year to year. Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amounts primarily reflected interest expense of $22.8 million in each year, related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt and interest income of $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. The Company expects the effective tax rate to decrease in the future as a greater portion of Moodys business migrates to lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $381.2 million in 2002, an increase of $107.4 million or 39.2% from $273.8 million in 2001. Strong growth was achieved in several U.S. market sectors, including residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, credit derivatives and asset backed securities. International structured finance revenue grew close to 60% versus 2001, reflecting strength in Europe, especially in credit derivatives and Japan, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $228.4 million in 2002, up 1.2% from $225.7 million in 2001. The number of issues in the U.S. corporate market declined about 17% in 2002 compared with the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. The effect of this decline on overall corporate finance revenue was tempered, however, by growth in bank loan ratings and relationship based revenue. European corporate finance generated double digit revenue growth versus the prior year despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service also contributed to revenue growth over the prior year. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $157.4 million in 2002, an increase of $26.7 million or 20.4% from $130.7 million in 2001. This reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in the U.S. in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Growth in issuer ratings and other relationship based revenue also contributed to the year over year growth. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance was strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. 17 Table of Contents Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to third party distributors contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses were, $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million, or 9.3% over 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other operating expense increases included consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products, due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Included in 2001expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. Excluding post acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, revenue for the prior Moodys Risk Management Services business grew 27.9% to $39.4 million in 2002. The revenue growth principally reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as more country specific models have been introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001. Excluding the $6.0 million of acquisition related, management transition and patent licensing charges described in Total Company Results above, and excluding all other KMV expenses of $31.9 million, expenses would have been $37.0 million in 2002, a 30.7% year over year increase. This increase primarily reflected higher compensation and benefit costs to support business expansion and increased consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets partially offset by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill from a prior acquisition pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Excluding the aforementioned $6.0 million of expenses, and $6.3 million of amortization expense related to the KMV acquisition, the Moodys KMV segment would have reported operating income of $7.0 million. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Company Results Total Moodys revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The Companys 2001 revenue performance reflected strong growth in revenue across all ratings groups as well as in global research and Moodys Risk Management Services. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of $131.8 million or 30.7% from $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities. Moodys international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001, an increase of 36.1% over $173.4 million in 2000. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double digit growth. International revenue at Moodys Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 18 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $239.6 million in 2001 grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in the worldwide structured finance business, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write down investments in two Argentine rating agencies, due to the currency devaluation and unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results; costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other expenses related to the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001; and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly formed Moodys Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Moodys operating margin for 2001 was 50.0%, up from 47.9% in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Interest and other non operating expense was $16.6 million in 2001 compared with $4.5 million in 2000. The increase in 2001was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Companys $300 million private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.4% in 2001 compared to 44.2% in 2000. Net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared with $158.5 million in 2000. Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001, compared with $0.98 basic and $0.97 diluted in 2000. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $765.9 million in 2001, up 32.2% from $579.3 million in 2000. Strong double digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance, public finance and global research drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. Asset backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. European structured finance growth was very strong primarily due to credit derivatives, asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds, with robust refinancing activity. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000. Also contributing to revenue growth was Moodys Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9.0 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institutions and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $352.9 million in 2001, an increase of $80.5 million, or 29.6% from $272.4 million in 2000. Of this increase, $14.4 million was due to the Argentine investment write down, the Companys legal settlement with the Department of Justice, and charitable expenses, all as described above. The remaining increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in 19 Table of Contents global structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Companys very strong 2001 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $11.5 million in 2001 versus $11.4 million in 2000. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $401.5 million in 2001 was up 35.9% from $295.5 million in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Moodys Risk Management Services Revenue for the Moodys Risk Management Services business was $30.8 million in 2001, an increase of 33.9% over 2000. This increase was driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for Moodys Risk Management Services were $28.3 million in 2001 compared with $24.8 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses and increased professional fees to support product development. Depreciation and amortization expense was $5.5 million in 2001 versus $5.2 million in 2000. Moodys Risk Management Services reported an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $7.0 million in 2000. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 18 countries outside the United States and over 85% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was billed in U.S. dollars. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $39.9 million at December 31, 2002, approximately $33.1 million was located outside the United States (with $18.0 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $334.8 million, $321.4 million, and $70.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase of $13.4 million in 2002 versus 2001 reflected growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Partially offsetting these factors were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million) and an increased investment in accounts receivable reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2002 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2003. The strength in 2002 ratings and research business volumes, as well as the acquisition of KMV, also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue over the prior year. The increase in other liabilities in 2002 reflected increased accruals for pension and other post retirement benefits, and tax exposures. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, a $174.6 million payment made to Old DB in 2000 in connection with the filing of an amended tax return for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods (as further described in Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Contingencies) and year to year growth in net 20 Table of Contents income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected the deferral of approximately $50 million of income tax payments noted above. Moodys accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.6 million higher than the prior year end. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year end 2001 were $47.6 million higher than the prior year end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $223.6 million, $30.0 million and $33.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002, $15.2 million for investments in international rating agencies in 2001 and $17.4 million for the acquisition of a financial software products company in 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally included investments in developing and upgrading computer hardware and software and purchases of office furnishings and equipment, were $18.1 million in 2002, $14.8 million in 2001 and $14.4 million in 2000. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($236.6) million, ($248.1) million and $79.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Share repurchases, employee stock option exercises, dividend payments and debt proceeds and repayments were the principal activities reflected in these amounts. Spending for share repurchases totaled $369.9 million in 2002, $267.6 million in 2001 and $71.8 million in 2000. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $54.0 million in 2002, $47.8 million in 2001 and $10.1 million in 2000. In addition, dividends paid were $27.8 million, $28.3 million and $7.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net proceeds from borrowings totaled $107.1 million in 2002 (as described below) and $104.5 million in 2000 representing net proceeds from the $300 million long term financing that was put in place at the time of the Companys spin off from Old DB, as described below. In addition, cash flow from financing activities in 2000 reflected cash distributions made to Old DB through the Distribution Date. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. Moodys has since borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management is considering pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2002, Moodys had $107.1 million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities, in addition to the $300 million of long term financing. Indebtedness In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowings outstanding of $76.1 million under the 5 year facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.64% per annum, and $31.0 million under the 364 day facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.73% per annum. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2002, such premium was 22 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points to 12.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2002. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility. In April 2002, Moodys used the Facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the KMV acquisition; amounts outstanding under the Facility were repaid in the second quarter of 2002. Since that time, Moodys has borrowed under the Facility to fund share repurchases 21 Table of Contents as noted above. Interest incurred under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which Moodys expects to complete by mid 2004. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Moodys repurchased 8.2 million shares at a total cost of $369.9 million, including 2.7 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2002, Moodys has repurchased 19.5 million shares at a total cost of $709.3 million, including 6.1 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years (in millions) Borrowings under credit facilities $ 107.1 $ 107.1 $ $ $ Notes payable 300.0 300.0 Operating lease obligations 53.2 13.5 23.1 15.1 1.5 Capital lease obligations 3.7 1.2 2.5 Purchase obligations (1) 11.4 6.4 3.8 1.2 Total $ 475.4 $ 128.2 $ 329.4 $ 16.3 $ 1.5 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 22 Table of Contents Outlook Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 31 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results following this section. Results of Operations Moodys results in 2002 and 2001, including growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, have exceeded the Companys long term financial targets, which are for low teens percent growth in Moodys Investors Service revenue and operating income, with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in mid teens percent growth in diluted earnings per share. The Company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets. For the Moodys KMV business, the Company expects revenue to grow to $200 million by 2005, with an operating margin (before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles) of greater than or equal to 20%. Moodys is providing its outlook for 2003 at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment, and the timing of such changes, creates important potential variance in the outlook. In Moodys Investors Service, moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in 2003 is anticipated despite the Companys expectation of a significant decline in the U.S. housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings, and lower growth in U.S. consumer spending affecting asset backed issuance. In global corporate finance, the Company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in 2003 despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the U.S. In the U.S. public finance sector, issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak. Nevertheless, because of an expected decline in refinancing activity, the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in 2003. Moodys also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business. Finally, healthy growth in the Moodys KMV business is expected. Moodys expenses for 2003 will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices, technology initiatives, product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. Moodys expects a slight decline in the operating margin in 2003 compared to the very high margin level in 2002, before the impact of expensing stock options (which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). Overall for 2003, Moodys expects that percent revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digits. With the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits, before the approximate $0.04 per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate $0.05 per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy (which is discussed in Note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Event). The Companys 2003 outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the United States, including the recently published SEC report on rating agencies pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which is discussed elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Based on managements current assessment, Moodys does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the Companys 2003 outlook. However, changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry, possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies, could have an effect in the future. Cash Flow Moodys believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2003. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Companys approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends. Should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more tax efficient, the Company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies. In addition, as described above, the Company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during 2002 to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the KMV acquisition and share repurchase, and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. 23 Table of Contents In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2003, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 83% of Moodys revenue in 2002 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2002 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain U.S. sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, Ltd. (DBRS) are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. In its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets, the SEC has indicated that it is exploring whether (i) there are viable alternatives to the NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations and (ii) whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve NRSRO recognition. The recognition of DBRS as a NRSRO occurred in February 2003, after the release of the SECs report. Elimination of the NRSRO concept or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share for Moodys. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 24 Table of Contents and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In October 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a report that recommended changes in SEC regulation of rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considers a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In the report, the SEC stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to many participants in the European capital markets, including credit rating agencies. Depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted, such implementation guidelines may increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 25 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a 26 Table of Contents spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. Discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and The Dun Bradstreet Corporation entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement) pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities (IRI Liabilities) that may arise out of or in connection with the IRI action and (ii) to conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities, if any, become payable (the ACN Maximum Amount), and that The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to (i) any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion (but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval), and (ii) payment of related fees and expenses. For these purposes, financial viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such plan, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such plan, for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen merged with VNU N.V. Pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount, and VNU assumed ACNielsens liabilities under that agreement. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In 1999, NMR was acquired by VNU N.V. and VNU assumed NMRs liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. However, as between themselves, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made with respect to the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect Moodys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. 27 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2002, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Notice, the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1994, 1995 and 1996 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the IRS. In addition, the IRS recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notice (and including penalties), and were to prevail in its position, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. The Company estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $55 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, New DB has received a Preliminary Summary Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for 1996. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Report and were to prevail in this matter, then New DB would be required to pay the assessment. If New DB were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Moodys estimates that its share of the exposure to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $46 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph. Amortization Expense Deductions The IRS has requested from New DB documentation with respect to a transaction executed in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. It is possible that the IRS could ultimately challenge these deductions and that New DB could make payments to the IRS related to previously claimed deductions. In that event, Moodys would be required to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Management estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $89 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take with respect to assessments and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB 28 Table of Contents responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. A decision from the arbitration panel is expected in 2003. If NMR should prevail in the arbitration against IMS Health and, in turn, IMS Health should prevail against Old DB, then the Company believes that the additional liability of Old DB would be approximately $15 million, net of tax benefits. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys and New DB would each be responsible for one half of such amount, or approximately $7.5 million. The Company believes that the claim asserted against Old DB by IMS Health is without merit. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters. However, it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, which could result in material charges to Moodys future reported results. In addition, the cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $202 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. Dividends Since the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company has paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 2002 and 2001, and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moodys was a subsidiary of Old DB, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old DB shareholders. 29 Table of Contents In December 2002, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2003 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2003 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2003. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors.
