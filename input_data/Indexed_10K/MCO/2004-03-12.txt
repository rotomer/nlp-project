Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 30 of this annual report on Form 10 K, is incorporated into this Item 3 by reference. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below and in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contingencies. LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10 K, no matter was submitted to a vote of Security Holders. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Information in response to this Item is set forth under the captions Common Stock Information and Dividends in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The Companys selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million in 2000 and $17.2 million in 1999. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity.

Interest expense was immaterial in 1999. The 2003 amount also includes a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy. (3) The 2002 results of operations include revenue of $42.1 million, expenses of $42.8 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 37 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 27. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such 14 Table of Contents cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, deferred revenue included approximately $26 million and $20 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included approximately $26 million and $22 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2003 and 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of $16.2 million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($126.4 million at December 31, 2003), and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 15 Table of Contents the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: Future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments). In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on Moodys pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Pre Assumption Used for tax Expense in 2003 2003 (decrease)/increase Discount Rate 6.75 % ($ 2.5 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 3.91 % $ 1.0 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.10 % ($ 1.0 ) Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. 16 Table of Contents An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for Amount of Increase in Pre tax Expense in 2003 2003 Assumption (decrease)/increase Expected Dividend Yield 0.41 % 0.10 % ($ 0.1 ) Expected Share Price Volatility 30 % 5 % $ 1.2 Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 years 1.0 year $ 1.1 Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. Moodys strong revenue growth was achieved despite expectations early in the year that the Company would encounter a difficult macroeconomic and capital markets environment. The Company benefited from better than expected revenue in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 200 basis points of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million and higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. 18 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 150 basis points of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.5 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This item accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 225 basis points of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Refinancing activity has slowed significantly in recent months, and Moodys expects a decline in this sector in 2004 as discussed below. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year although dollar issuance 19 Table of Contents declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% due primarily to refinancing activity, as spreads tightened and new issuers accessed the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year period. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Moodys expects that public finance issuance and revenue will decline in 2004, as discussed below. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly for options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 20 Table of Contents MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit decisioning software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003 whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business, with global structured finance contributing nearly half of the year to year growth. MKMV accounted for $50.7 million of year to year growth, including $42.1 million of revenue from the April 2002 acquisition of KMV. Revenue in the United States was $680.8 million in 2002, an increase of $120.1 million or 21.4% from $560.7 million in 2001. The 2002 increase reflected $85 million of growth in ratings revenue, with higher issuance volumes in several market sectors due to the favorable interest rate environment. Structured finance contributed $66 million of the U.S. ratings revenue growth, with the residential mortgage sector increasing approximately $29 million and other sectors contributing to growth as well. MKMV contributed $23 million of growth, including $19 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. Moodys international revenue was $342.5 million in 2002, an increase of 45.1% from $236.0 million in 2001. International growth was primarily driven by structured finance, with European structured finance growing by over $30 million. MKMV contributed $28 million of growth, including $23 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 33% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew $45.7 million or 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $26 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. In addition, the April 2002 acquisition of KMV resulted in an increase in operating expenses of $12.2 million compared with the prior year. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up $33.7 million or 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to $23.1 million of expenses related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. Other increases included higher compensation and benefits of $3 million to support business expansion; higher professional fees of $4 million primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems; and higher legal fees of $3 million primarily due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The increase was principally due to $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. 21 Table of Contents Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amount in each year included interest expense of $22.8 million related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower interest income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $384.3 million in 2002, an increase of $110.5 million or 40.4% from $273.8 million in 2001. The U.S. structured finance business accounted for $66 million of this growth, with nearly $29 million of growth in the residential mortgage sector and over $10 million of growth in revenue from credit derivatives. The largest component of international structured finance revenue growth was Europe, with a year to year increase of over $30 million. The credit derivatives sector was the largest growth driver in Europe. Structured finance revenue in Japan grew approximately $7 million year to year, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $227.7 million in 2002, up 0.9% from $225.7 million in 2001. U.S. corporate finance revenue declined $9 million year to year. This reflected a year to year decline of 17% in the number of issues, with weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. Price increases and growth in relationship based revenue partially offset the impact of this decline. European corporate finance contributed approximately $4 million of revenue growth in 2002 despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service starting in January 2002 added approximately $5 million of year to year revenue growth. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $155.0 million in 2002, an increase of $24.3 million or 18.6% from $130.7 million in 2001. In the U.S., growth of $11 million reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, revenue increased $8 million as the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance volumes were strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Revenue in the United States grew $12 million year to year, and international revenue increased $10 million, mainly in Europe. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million or 9.3% over 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $24 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other 22 Table of Contents expense increases included $4 million for consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, $3 million for legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries and higher rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Included in 2001 expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. The expense increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. The April 2002 acquisition of KMV accounted for $42.1 million of the year to year revenue growth. The remaining $8.6 million of revenue growth reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as additional country specific models were introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001, an increase of $46.6 million. Post acquisition operating expenses of KMV accounted for $35.3 million of the year to year expense growth. The remaining increase principally reflected growth of $5 million in compensation and benefit costs to support growth in the legacy MRMS business, and higher consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $1.5 million of goodwill amortization, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 15% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 10% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $269.1 million at December 31, 2003, approximately $56.8 million was located outside the United States (with $35.5 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Overview Cash and cash equivalents increased $229.2 million during 2003, to $269.1 million. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, and proceeds from stock plans were $79.0 million. Significant uses of this cash flow were $171.7 million for share repurchases, $107.1 million for the repayment of short term bank debt outstanding at year end 2002, dividend payments of $26.8 million and capital expenditures of $17.9 million. Cash Flow Analysis The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, $334.8 million and $321.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. In addition, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, increases in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 increased by $13.4 million compared with 2001, in part reflecting growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of $12.4 million. Partially offsetting these impacts were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, and higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million). The increase in other liabilities in 2002 included increased reserves related to pension and other post retirement benefits. Net cash used in investing activities was $17.1 million, $223.6 million and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in affiliates. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002 and $9.6 million for Korea Investors Service during 2001. The Company made investments in international rating agencies totaling $5.6 million in 2001. Cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled $17.9 million, $18.1 million and $14.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $227.7 million, $236.6 million and $248.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003 the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the Companys bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $171.7 million in 2003, $369.9 million in 2002 and $267.6 million in 2001. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $79.0 million in 2003, $54.0 million in 2002 and $47.8 million in 2001. In addition, dividends paid were $26.8 million, $27.8 million and $28.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and the Company has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would 24 Table of Contents result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2003, Moodys had no outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities and $300 million of long term financing payable in October 2005. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2004. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use the majority of its cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. The Company also currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. The continued payment of dividends at this rate is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. As described above, the Company has borrowed from time to time under its bank revolving credit facility and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2004, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies and to satisfy any adverse judgment rendered in the action in France that, in each instance, are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding long term financing of $300 million and a bank revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $107.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. The $300 million of long term financing was secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2003, such premium was 18 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points of the facility amount to 12.5 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 7 basis points at December 31, 2003. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility amount. 25 Table of Contents The Company initially borrowed under the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2002 to fund a portion of the acquisition price for KMV, and subsequently repaid those borrowings. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Interest paid under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Moodys repurchased 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $171.7 million, including 3.2 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2003, Moodys has repurchased 23.0 million shares at a total cost of $881.0 million, including 9.3 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable $ 300.0 $ $ 300.0 $ $ Operating lease obligations 54.5 17.2 21.4 10.8 5.1 Capital lease obligations 2.5 1.2 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (1) 4.0 4.0 Purchase obligations (2) 11.3 5.4 4.8 1.1 Total $ 372.3 $ 23.8 $ 331.5 $ 11.9 $ 5.1 26 Table of Contents (1) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ending December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. Outlook Moodys outlook for 2004 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, consumer spending, corporate profitability and business investment spending, and capital markets issuance activity. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below. The Company expects interest rates in the United States to rise during 2004, with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment. As a result, Moodys expects to see lower issuance in the U.S. corporate bond market, both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector, which posted record issuance in 2003. Despite the issuance declines, revenue from new products and growth in relationship based revenue should produce modest growth in both the U.S. corporate finance and financial institutions sectors. The Company is continuing to introduce the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, consisting of financial reporting, off balance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports, and Moodys plans to cover approximately 350 corporations and financial institutions in North America by the end of 2004. Moodys also expects good growth in consumer spending in 2004. As a result, the Company expects that growth in revenue from rating asset backed securitizations, together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business, will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgage backed securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines. In the public finance ratings business Moodys expects a revenue decline of approximately 20% in 2004, reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and new money borrowings. The Company expects continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects to see double digit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses. The Company is also projecting strong year over year growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business, all producing approximately 20% international revenue growth in ratings and research, including the effects of currency translation. Finally, Moodys expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at Moodys KMV. Moodys expenses for 2004 will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices, technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. The Company will continue investment in the Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Moodys expects its operating margin to decline about 100 basis points in 2004 from the level achieved in 2003 due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin MKMV business. An additional 100 basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stock based compensation. Since the Company adopted expensing of stock based compensation prospectively effective January 1, 2003, the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current four year option vesting period. Overall for 2004, Moodys expects that year over year revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digit percent range. With the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid to high single digit percent range on a reported basis. Reported earnings per share in 2003 included the impacts of the insurance gain, the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stock based compensation discussed above. The impact of expensing stock based compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in 2004, and is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share in 2004 compared with $0.04 per share in 2003. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently 27 Table of Contents known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2003 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2003 that was greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes, the U.S. components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and DBRS are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality 28 Table of Contents products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considered a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In June 2003 the SEC released a Concept Release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws, the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used, and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies. In February 2004, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling on the European Commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in Europe and possible registration criteria. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to all participants in the European capital markets. Credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines. However, depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers, such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some European Union countries. If so, the guidelines could, among other things, alter rating agencies communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, and increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 29 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). 30 Table of Contents In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In July 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the U.S. and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRIs complaint originally alleged damages in excess of $350 million, which IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. In April 2003, the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of IRIs claims and granted in part a motion by IRI seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the Court had previously made in favor of the defendants. In December of 2003, IRI was acquired by the Gingko Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Symphony Technology II A. L. P. and certain other parties. As part of that transaction, a statutory trust called the Information Resources, Inc. Litigation Contingent Payment Rights Trust (the Trust) was formed. The Trust was created, in part, to issue contingent value rights certificates (CVRs), which represent an interest in the IRI lawsuit. The CVRs are governed by a Contingent Value Rights Agreement among IRI and the acquirers, and are a tradeable security listed on the OTC Bulletin Board. As part of the purchase consideration, each IRI stockholder received one CVR for each share of IRI common stock owned, entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the IRI lawsuit, if any, allocated to the Trust. The Trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 68% of any proceeds from the IRI lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than $200 million and 75% of any such proceeds in excess of $200 million. The remaining proceeds, if any, will be the property of IRI. A body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the IRI Litigation on behalf of IRI and CVR holders. Gingko Corporation named two of the rights agents, IRI named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth independent rights agent. Under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, a majority of the rights agents (other than the independent rights agent) must approve any settlement of the IRI lawsuit. The information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by Gingko Acquisition Corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the Trust in connection with the acquisition of IRI. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense 31 Table of Contents Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that: ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the ACN Maximum Amount); and Donnelley and NMR will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. As noted above, ACNielsen is responsible for the IRI Liabilities up to the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment, if any, in IRIs favor (the ACN Payment). The ACN Payment could be less than the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides for each of Donnelley and NMR to pay IRI 50% of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the ACN Payment, and for ACNielsen to issue a secured note (the ACN Note), subject to certain limits, to each of Donnelley and NMR for the amount of their payment. The principal amount of each ACN Note issued to Donnelley and NMR, however, is limited to 50% of the difference between the ACN Maximum Amount and the ACN Payment, and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed 50% of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize ACNielsens claims paying ability. The ACN Notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then NMR and Donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal, and each shall pay 50% of the costs of such bond, if any, which cost will be added to IRI Liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys would be responsible for 25% of the total costs of any bond. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to: any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designated to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring shareholder approval; and payment of interest on the ACN Notes and related fees and expenses. For these purposes, viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such recapitalization plan, the payment of interest on the ACN Notes, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to: pay its debts as they become due; and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan, for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V. VNU N.V. assumed ACNielsens liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU N.V. is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. 32 Table of Contents As a result, the Company will be responsible for the payment of 25% of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount (as adjusted to include VNU N.V.). New DB will be responsible for the payment of an additional 25% (together constituting Donnelleys liability under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement for 50% of such amount) and NMR will be responsible for payment of the remaining 50% of liability in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. In addition, each of the above parties, in accordance with the foregoing percentages, may be required to advance a portion of the amount, if any, by which the ACN Maximum Amount exceeds the amount of the ACN Payment. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of a party to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the IRI Liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing, and although the court earlier set a trial date for September 2004, the court rescinded that date in January 2004 and there is currently no trial date set. Moodys is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the IRI action or the financial condition of ACNielsen and VNU N.V. at the time of any such outcome (and hence the Company cannot estimate the amount of the ACN Payment, the ACN Maximum Amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by VNU N.V. and ACNielsen under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Therefore, Moodys is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if Moodys is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Report. During the third quarter of 2003, New DB filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. 33 Table of Contents Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $57 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, during the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996. During the third quarter of 2003, the partnership filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $50 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph, and Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, New DB participated in meetings with the IRS Appeals Office on the two matters described above. In addition, in the first quarter of 2004, New DB received an Examination Report relating to Old DBs participation in the partnership structure for the first quarter of 1997. In this Report the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax return for the 1997 tax year. New DB also received an Examination Report issued to the partnership with respect to its 1997 tax year. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1997. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS in its Reports and will pursue the same remedies with the same possible consequences described above. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS in relation to the two Examination Reports could be up to approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions During the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Notices of Proposed Adjustment. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $92 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to the partnership transaction entered into in 1997. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. In addition, the IRS proposed to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate 34 Table of Contents to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $125 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. The case is expected to go to trial in 2005. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. On April 29, 2003, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of IMS Health in the arbitration proceeding, awarding IMS Health its full claim plus interest in a decision binding on all parties. As a result, IMS Healths contingent claim against Old DB (and consequently Moodys and New DB) in connection with this matter has been rendered moot. As no amount with respect to this matter had been accrued by Moodys, the arbitration panel ruling is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2003, Moodys had reserves of approximately $126 million with respect to such matters, which reflected an increase of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 relating to the Amortization Expense Deductions matter. Although the matter had previously been under audit, the Company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the Notices of Proposed Adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a formalization by the IRS of its position on the matter. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash 35 Table of Contents flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $331 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. Dividends During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in each year. In December 2003, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2004 dividend of 7.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2004. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2004 was 4,781.

Those statements appear in the sections entitled Outlook and Contingencies under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 14 of this annual report on Form 10 K, under Legal Proceedings in Item 3, Part I of this Form 10 K, and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words believes, expects, anticipates and other words relating to Moodys views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; possible judicial decisions in various jurisdictions regarding the status of and potential liabilities of rating agencies; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the outcome of other legal actions to which the Company, from time to time, may be named as a party; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contingencies. LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10 K, no matter was submitted to a vote of Security Holders. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Information in response to this Item is set forth under the captions Common Stock Information and Dividends in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The Companys selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million in 2000 and $17.2 million in 1999. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 37 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 27. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such 14 Table of Contents cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, deferred revenue included approximately $26 million and $20 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included approximately $26 million and $22 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2003 and 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of $16.2 million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($126.4 million at December 31, 2003), and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 15 Table of Contents the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: Future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments). In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on Moodys pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Pre Assumption Used for tax Expense in 2003 2003 (decrease)/increase Discount Rate 6.75 % ($ 2.5 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 3.91 % $ 1.0 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.10 % ($ 1.0 ) Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. 16 Table of Contents An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for Amount of Increase in Pre tax Expense in 2003 2003 Assumption (decrease)/increase Expected Dividend Yield 0.41 % 0.10 % ($ 0.1 ) Expected Share Price Volatility 30 % 5 % $ 1.2 Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 years 1.0 year $ 1.1 Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. Moodys strong revenue growth was achieved despite expectations early in the year that the Company would encounter a difficult macroeconomic and capital markets environment. The Company benefited from better than expected revenue in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 200 basis points of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million and higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. 18 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 150 basis points of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.5 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This item accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 225 basis points of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Refinancing activity has slowed significantly in recent months, and Moodys expects a decline in this sector in 2004 as discussed below. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year although dollar issuance 19 Table of Contents declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% due primarily to refinancing activity, as spreads tightened and new issuers accessed the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year period. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Moodys expects that public finance issuance and revenue will decline in 2004, as discussed below. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly for options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 20 Table of Contents MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit decisioning software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003 whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business, with global structured finance contributing nearly half of the year to year growth. MKMV accounted for $50.7 million of year to year growth, including $42.1 million of revenue from the April 2002 acquisition of KMV. Revenue in the United States was $680.8 million in 2002, an increase of $120.1 million or 21.4% from $560.7 million in 2001. The 2002 increase reflected $85 million of growth in ratings revenue, with higher issuance volumes in several market sectors due to the favorable interest rate environment. Structured finance contributed $66 million of the U.S. ratings revenue growth, with the residential mortgage sector increasing approximately $29 million and other sectors contributing to growth as well. MKMV contributed $23 million of growth, including $19 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. Moodys international revenue was $342.5 million in 2002, an increase of 45.1% from $236.0 million in 2001. International growth was primarily driven by structured finance, with European structured finance growing by over $30 million. MKMV contributed $28 million of growth, including $23 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 33% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew $45.7 million or 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $26 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. In addition, the April 2002 acquisition of KMV resulted in an increase in operating expenses of $12.2 million compared with the prior year. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up $33.7 million or 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to $23.1 million of expenses related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. Other increases included higher compensation and benefits of $3 million to support business expansion; higher professional fees of $4 million primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems; and higher legal fees of $3 million primarily due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The increase was principally due to $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. 21 Table of Contents Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amount in each year included interest expense of $22.8 million related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower interest income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $384.3 million in 2002, an increase of $110.5 million or 40.4% from $273.8 million in 2001. The U.S. structured finance business accounted for $66 million of this growth, with nearly $29 million of growth in the residential mortgage sector and over $10 million of growth in revenue from credit derivatives. The largest component of international structured finance revenue growth was Europe, with a year to year increase of over $30 million. The credit derivatives sector was the largest growth driver in Europe. Structured finance revenue in Japan grew approximately $7 million year to year, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $227.7 million in 2002, up 0.9% from $225.7 million in 2001. U.S. corporate finance revenue declined $9 million year to year. This reflected a year to year decline of 17% in the number of issues, with weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. Price increases and growth in relationship based revenue partially offset the impact of this decline. European corporate finance contributed approximately $4 million of revenue growth in 2002 despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service starting in January 2002 added approximately $5 million of year to year revenue growth. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $155.0 million in 2002, an increase of $24.3 million or 18.6% from $130.7 million in 2001. In the U.S., growth of $11 million reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, revenue increased $8 million as the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance volumes were strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Revenue in the United States grew $12 million year to year, and international revenue increased $10 million, mainly in Europe. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million or 9.3% over 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $24 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other 22 Table of Contents expense increases included $4 million for consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, $3 million for legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries and higher rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Included in 2001 expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. The expense increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. The April 2002 acquisition of KMV accounted for $42.1 million of the year to year revenue growth. The remaining $8.6 million of revenue growth reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as additional country specific models were introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001, an increase of $46.6 million. Post acquisition operating expenses of KMV accounted for $35.3 million of the year to year expense growth. The remaining increase principally reflected growth of $5 million in compensation and benefit costs to support growth in the legacy MRMS business, and higher consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $1.5 million of goodwill amortization, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 15% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 10% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $269.1 million at December 31, 2003, approximately $56.8 million was located outside the United States (with $35.5 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Overview Cash and cash equivalents increased $229.2 million during 2003, to $269.1 million. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, and proceeds from stock plans were $79.0 million. Significant uses of this cash flow were $171.7 million for share repurchases, $107.1 million for the repayment of short term bank debt outstanding at year end 2002, dividend payments of $26.8 million and capital expenditures of $17.9 million. Cash Flow Analysis The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, $334.8 million and $321.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. In addition, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, increases in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 increased by $13.4 million compared with 2001, in part reflecting growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of $12.4 million. Partially offsetting these impacts were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, and higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million). The increase in other liabilities in 2002 included increased reserves related to pension and other post retirement benefits. Net cash used in investing activities was $17.1 million, $223.6 million and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in affiliates. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002 and $9.6 million for Korea Investors Service during 2001. The Company made investments in international rating agencies totaling $5.6 million in 2001. Cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled $17.9 million, $18.1 million and $14.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $227.7 million, $236.6 million and $248.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003 the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the Companys bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $171.7 million in 2003, $369.9 million in 2002 and $267.6 million in 2001. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $79.0 million in 2003, $54.0 million in 2002 and $47.8 million in 2001. In addition, dividends paid were $26.8 million, $27.8 million and $28.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and the Company has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would 24 Table of Contents result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2003, Moodys had no outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities and $300 million of long term financing payable in October 2005. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2004. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use the majority of its cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. The Company also currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. The continued payment of dividends at this rate is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. As described above, the Company has borrowed from time to time under its bank revolving credit facility and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2004, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies and to satisfy any adverse judgment rendered in the action in France that, in each instance, are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding long term financing of $300 million and a bank revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $107.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. The $300 million of long term financing was secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2003, such premium was 18 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points of the facility amount to 12.5 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 7 basis points at December 31, 2003. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility amount. 25 Table of Contents The Company initially borrowed under the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2002 to fund a portion of the acquisition price for KMV, and subsequently repaid those borrowings. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Interest paid under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Moodys repurchased 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $171.7 million, including 3.2 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2003, Moodys has repurchased 23.0 million shares at a total cost of $881.0 million, including 9.3 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable $ 300.0 $ $ 300.0 $ $ Operating lease obligations 54.5 17.2 21.4 10.8 5.1 Capital lease obligations 2.5 1.2 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (1) 4.0 4.0 Purchase obligations (2) 11.3 5.4 4.8 1.1 Total $ 372.3 $ 23.8 $ 331.5 $ 11.9 $ 5.1 26 Table of Contents (1) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ending December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. Outlook Moodys outlook for 2004 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, consumer spending, corporate profitability and business investment spending, and capital markets issuance activity. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below. The Company expects interest rates in the United States to rise during 2004, with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment. As a result, Moodys expects to see lower issuance in the U.S. corporate bond market, both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector, which posted record issuance in 2003. Despite the issuance declines, revenue from new products and growth in relationship based revenue should produce modest growth in both the U.S. corporate finance and financial institutions sectors. The Company is continuing to introduce the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, consisting of financial reporting, off balance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports, and Moodys plans to cover approximately 350 corporations and financial institutions in North America by the end of 2004. Moodys also expects good growth in consumer spending in 2004. As a result, the Company expects that growth in revenue from rating asset backed securitizations, together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business, will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgage backed securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines. In the public finance ratings business Moodys expects a revenue decline of approximately 20% in 2004, reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and new money borrowings. The Company expects continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects to see double digit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses. The Company is also projecting strong year over year growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business, all producing approximately 20% international revenue growth in ratings and research, including the effects of currency translation. Finally, Moodys expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at Moodys KMV. Moodys expenses for 2004 will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices, technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. The Company will continue investment in the Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Moodys expects its operating margin to decline about 100 basis points in 2004 from the level achieved in 2003 due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin MKMV business. An additional 100 basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stock based compensation. Since the Company adopted expensing of stock based compensation prospectively effective January 1, 2003, the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current four year option vesting period. Overall for 2004, Moodys expects that year over year revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digit percent range. With the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid to high single digit percent range on a reported basis. Reported earnings per share in 2003 included the impacts of the insurance gain, the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stock based compensation discussed above. The impact of expensing stock based compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in 2004, and is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share in 2004 compared with $0.04 per share in 2003. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently 27 Table of Contents known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2003 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2003 that was greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes, the U.S. components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and DBRS are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality 28 Table of Contents products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considered a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In June 2003 the SEC released a Concept Release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws, the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used, and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies. In February 2004, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling on the European Commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in Europe and possible registration criteria. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to all participants in the European capital markets. Credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines. However, depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers, such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some European Union countries. If so, the guidelines could, among other things, alter rating agencies communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, and increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 29 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). 30 Table of Contents In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In July 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the U.S. and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRIs complaint originally alleged damages in excess of $350 million, which IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. In April 2003, the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of IRIs claims and granted in part a motion by IRI seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the Court had previously made in favor of the defendants. In December of 2003, IRI was acquired by the Gingko Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Symphony Technology II A. L. P. and certain other parties. As part of that transaction, a statutory trust called the Information Resources, Inc. Litigation Contingent Payment Rights Trust (the Trust) was formed. The Trust was created, in part, to issue contingent value rights certificates (CVRs), which represent an interest in the IRI lawsuit. The CVRs are governed by a Contingent Value Rights Agreement among IRI and the acquirers, and are a tradeable security listed on the OTC Bulletin Board. As part of the purchase consideration, each IRI stockholder received one CVR for each share of IRI common stock owned, entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the IRI lawsuit, if any, allocated to the Trust. The Trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 68% of any proceeds from the IRI lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than $200 million and 75% of any such proceeds in excess of $200 million. The remaining proceeds, if any, will be the property of IRI. A body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the IRI Litigation on behalf of IRI and CVR holders. Gingko Corporation named two of the rights agents, IRI named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth independent rights agent. Under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, a majority of the rights agents (other than the independent rights agent) must approve any settlement of the IRI lawsuit. The information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by Gingko Acquisition Corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the Trust in connection with the acquisition of IRI. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense 31 Table of Contents Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that: ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the ACN Maximum Amount); and Donnelley and NMR will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. As noted above, ACNielsen is responsible for the IRI Liabilities up to the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment, if any, in IRIs favor (the ACN Payment). The ACN Payment could be less than the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides for each of Donnelley and NMR to pay IRI 50% of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the ACN Payment, and for ACNielsen to issue a secured note (the ACN Note), subject to certain limits, to each of Donnelley and NMR for the amount of their payment. The principal amount of each ACN Note issued to Donnelley and NMR, however, is limited to 50% of the difference between the ACN Maximum Amount and the ACN Payment, and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed 50% of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize ACNielsens claims paying ability. The ACN Notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then NMR and Donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal, and each shall pay 50% of the costs of such bond, if any, which cost will be added to IRI Liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys would be responsible for 25% of the total costs of any bond. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to: any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designated to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring shareholder approval; and payment of interest on the ACN Notes and related fees and expenses. For these purposes, viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such recapitalization plan, the payment of interest on the ACN Notes, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to: pay its debts as they become due; and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan, for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V. VNU N.V. assumed ACNielsens liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU N.V. is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. 32 Table of Contents As a result, the Company will be responsible for the payment of 25% of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount (as adjusted to include VNU N.V.). New DB will be responsible for the payment of an additional 25% (together constituting Donnelleys liability under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement for 50% of such amount) and NMR will be responsible for payment of the remaining 50% of liability in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. In addition, each of the above parties, in accordance with the foregoing percentages, may be required to advance a portion of the amount, if any, by which the ACN Maximum Amount exceeds the amount of the ACN Payment. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of a party to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the IRI Liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing, and although the court earlier set a trial date for September 2004, the court rescinded that date in January 2004 and there is currently no trial date set. Moodys is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the IRI action or the financial condition of ACNielsen and VNU N.V. at the time of any such outcome (and hence the Company cannot estimate the amount of the ACN Payment, the ACN Maximum Amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by VNU N.V. and ACNielsen under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Therefore, Moodys is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if Moodys is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Report. During the third quarter of 2003, New DB filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. 33 Table of Contents Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $57 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, during the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996. During the third quarter of 2003, the partnership filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $50 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph, and Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, New DB participated in meetings with the IRS Appeals Office on the two matters described above. In addition, in the first quarter of 2004, New DB received an Examination Report relating to Old DBs participation in the partnership structure for the first quarter of 1997. In this Report the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax return for the 1997 tax year. New DB also received an Examination Report issued to the partnership with respect to its 1997 tax year. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1997. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS in its Reports and will pursue the same remedies with the same possible consequences described above. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS in relation to the two Examination Reports could be up to approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions During the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Notices of Proposed Adjustment. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $92 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to the partnership transaction entered into in 1997. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. In addition, the IRS proposed to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate 34 Table of Contents to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $125 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. The case is expected to go to trial in 2005. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. On April 29, 2003, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of IMS Health in the arbitration proceeding, awarding IMS Health its full claim plus interest in a decision binding on all parties. As a result, IMS Healths contingent claim against Old DB (and consequently Moodys and New DB) in connection with this matter has been rendered moot. As no amount with respect to this matter had been accrued by Moodys, the arbitration panel ruling is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2003, Moodys had reserves of approximately $126 million with respect to such matters, which reflected an increase of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 relating to the Amortization Expense Deductions matter. Although the matter had previously been under audit, the Company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the Notices of Proposed Adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a formalization by the IRS of its position on the matter. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash 35 Table of Contents flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $331 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. Dividends During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in each year. In December 2003, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2004 dividend of 7.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2004. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2004 was 4,781.

Those statements appear in the sections entitled Outlook and Contingencies under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 14 of this annual report on Form 10 K, under Legal Proceedings in Item 3, Part I of this Form 10 K, and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words believes, expects, anticipates and other words relating to Moodys views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; possible judicial decisions in various jurisdictions regarding the status of and potential liabilities of rating agencies; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the outcome of other legal actions to which the Company, from time to time, may be named as a party; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moodys expenses included allocations of costs from Old DB for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moodys based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moodys revenue in proportion to Old DBs total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million in 2000 and $17.2 million in 1999. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moodys in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity.

Interest expense was immaterial in 1999. The 2003 amount also includes a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy. (3) The 2002 results of operations include revenue of $42.1 million, expenses of $42.8 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 37 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 27. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such 14 Table of Contents cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, deferred revenue included approximately $26 million and $20 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included approximately $26 million and $22 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2003 and 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of $16.2 million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($126.4 million at December 31, 2003), and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 15 Table of Contents the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: Future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments). In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on Moodys pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Pre Assumption Used for tax Expense in 2003 2003 (decrease)/increase Discount Rate 6.75 % ($ 2.5 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 3.91 % $ 1.0 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.10 % ($ 1.0 ) Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. 16 Table of Contents An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for Amount of Increase in Pre tax Expense in 2003 2003 Assumption (decrease)/increase Expected Dividend Yield 0.41 % 0.10 % ($ 0.1 ) Expected Share Price Volatility 30 % 5 % $ 1.2 Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 years 1.0 year $ 1.1 Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. Moodys strong revenue growth was achieved despite expectations early in the year that the Company would encounter a difficult macroeconomic and capital markets environment. The Company benefited from better than expected revenue in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 200 basis points of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million and higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. 18 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 150 basis points of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.5 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This item accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 225 basis points of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Refinancing activity has slowed significantly in recent months, and Moodys expects a decline in this sector in 2004 as discussed below. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year although dollar issuance 19 Table of Contents declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% due primarily to refinancing activity, as spreads tightened and new issuers accessed the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year period. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Moodys expects that public finance issuance and revenue will decline in 2004, as discussed below. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly for options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 20 Table of Contents MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit decisioning software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003 whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business, with global structured finance contributing nearly half of the year to year growth. MKMV accounted for $50.7 million of year to year growth, including $42.1 million of revenue from the April 2002 acquisition of KMV. Revenue in the United States was $680.8 million in 2002, an increase of $120.1 million or 21.4% from $560.7 million in 2001. The 2002 increase reflected $85 million of growth in ratings revenue, with higher issuance volumes in several market sectors due to the favorable interest rate environment. Structured finance contributed $66 million of the U.S. ratings revenue growth, with the residential mortgage sector increasing approximately $29 million and other sectors contributing to growth as well. MKMV contributed $23 million of growth, including $19 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. Moodys international revenue was $342.5 million in 2002, an increase of 45.1% from $236.0 million in 2001. International growth was primarily driven by structured finance, with European structured finance growing by over $30 million. MKMV contributed $28 million of growth, including $23 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 33% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew $45.7 million or 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $26 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. In addition, the April 2002 acquisition of KMV resulted in an increase in operating expenses of $12.2 million compared with the prior year. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up $33.7 million or 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to $23.1 million of expenses related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. Other increases included higher compensation and benefits of $3 million to support business expansion; higher professional fees of $4 million primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems; and higher legal fees of $3 million primarily due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The increase was principally due to $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. 21 Table of Contents Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amount in each year included interest expense of $22.8 million related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower interest income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $384.3 million in 2002, an increase of $110.5 million or 40.4% from $273.8 million in 2001. The U.S. structured finance business accounted for $66 million of this growth, with nearly $29 million of growth in the residential mortgage sector and over $10 million of growth in revenue from credit derivatives. The largest component of international structured finance revenue growth was Europe, with a year to year increase of over $30 million. The credit derivatives sector was the largest growth driver in Europe. Structured finance revenue in Japan grew approximately $7 million year to year, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $227.7 million in 2002, up 0.9% from $225.7 million in 2001. U.S. corporate finance revenue declined $9 million year to year. This reflected a year to year decline of 17% in the number of issues, with weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. Price increases and growth in relationship based revenue partially offset the impact of this decline. European corporate finance contributed approximately $4 million of revenue growth in 2002 despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service starting in January 2002 added approximately $5 million of year to year revenue growth. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $155.0 million in 2002, an increase of $24.3 million or 18.6% from $130.7 million in 2001. In the U.S., growth of $11 million reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, revenue increased $8 million as the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance volumes were strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Revenue in the United States grew $12 million year to year, and international revenue increased $10 million, mainly in Europe. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million or 9.3% over 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $24 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other 22 Table of Contents expense increases included $4 million for consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, $3 million for legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries and higher rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Included in 2001 expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. The expense increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. The April 2002 acquisition of KMV accounted for $42.1 million of the year to year revenue growth. The remaining $8.6 million of revenue growth reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as additional country specific models were introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001, an increase of $46.6 million. Post acquisition operating expenses of KMV accounted for $35.3 million of the year to year expense growth. The remaining increase principally reflected growth of $5 million in compensation and benefit costs to support growth in the legacy MRMS business, and higher consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $1.5 million of goodwill amortization, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 15% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 10% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $269.1 million at December 31, 2003, approximately $56.8 million was located outside the United States (with $35.5 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Overview Cash and cash equivalents increased $229.2 million during 2003, to $269.1 million. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, and proceeds from stock plans were $79.0 million. Significant uses of this cash flow were $171.7 million for share repurchases, $107.1 million for the repayment of short term bank debt outstanding at year end 2002, dividend payments of $26.8 million and capital expenditures of $17.9 million. Cash Flow Analysis The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, $334.8 million and $321.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. In addition, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, increases in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 increased by $13.4 million compared with 2001, in part reflecting growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of $12.4 million. Partially offsetting these impacts were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, and higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million). The increase in other liabilities in 2002 included increased reserves related to pension and other post retirement benefits. Net cash used in investing activities was $17.1 million, $223.6 million and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in affiliates. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002 and $9.6 million for Korea Investors Service during 2001. The Company made investments in international rating agencies totaling $5.6 million in 2001. Cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled $17.9 million, $18.1 million and $14.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $227.7 million, $236.6 million and $248.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003 the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the Companys bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $171.7 million in 2003, $369.9 million in 2002 and $267.6 million in 2001. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $79.0 million in 2003, $54.0 million in 2002 and $47.8 million in 2001. In addition, dividends paid were $26.8 million, $27.8 million and $28.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and the Company has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would 24 Table of Contents result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2003, Moodys had no outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities and $300 million of long term financing payable in October 2005. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2004. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use the majority of its cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. The Company also currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. The continued payment of dividends at this rate is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. As described above, the Company has borrowed from time to time under its bank revolving credit facility and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2004, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies and to satisfy any adverse judgment rendered in the action in France that, in each instance, are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding long term financing of $300 million and a bank revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $107.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. The $300 million of long term financing was secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2003, such premium was 18 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points of the facility amount to 12.5 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 7 basis points at December 31, 2003. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility amount. 25 Table of Contents The Company initially borrowed under the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2002 to fund a portion of the acquisition price for KMV, and subsequently repaid those borrowings. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Interest paid under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Moodys repurchased 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $171.7 million, including 3.2 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2003, Moodys has repurchased 23.0 million shares at a total cost of $881.0 million, including 9.3 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable $ 300.0 $ $ 300.0 $ $ Operating lease obligations 54.5 17.2 21.4 10.8 5.1 Capital lease obligations 2.5 1.2 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (1) 4.0 4.0 Purchase obligations (2) 11.3 5.4 4.8 1.1 Total $ 372.3 $ 23.8 $ 331.5 $ 11.9 $ 5.1 26 Table of Contents (1) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ending December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. Outlook Moodys outlook for 2004 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, consumer spending, corporate profitability and business investment spending, and capital markets issuance activity. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below. The Company expects interest rates in the United States to rise during 2004, with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment. As a result, Moodys expects to see lower issuance in the U.S. corporate bond market, both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector, which posted record issuance in 2003. Despite the issuance declines, revenue from new products and growth in relationship based revenue should produce modest growth in both the U.S. corporate finance and financial institutions sectors. The Company is continuing to introduce the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, consisting of financial reporting, off balance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports, and Moodys plans to cover approximately 350 corporations and financial institutions in North America by the end of 2004. Moodys also expects good growth in consumer spending in 2004. As a result, the Company expects that growth in revenue from rating asset backed securitizations, together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business, will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgage backed securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines. In the public finance ratings business Moodys expects a revenue decline of approximately 20% in 2004, reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and new money borrowings. The Company expects continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects to see double digit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses. The Company is also projecting strong year over year growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business, all producing approximately 20% international revenue growth in ratings and research, including the effects of currency translation. Finally, Moodys expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at Moodys KMV. Moodys expenses for 2004 will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices, technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. The Company will continue investment in the Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Moodys expects its operating margin to decline about 100 basis points in 2004 from the level achieved in 2003 due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin MKMV business. An additional 100 basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stock based compensation. Since the Company adopted expensing of stock based compensation prospectively effective January 1, 2003, the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current four year option vesting period. Overall for 2004, Moodys expects that year over year revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digit percent range. With the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid to high single digit percent range on a reported basis. Reported earnings per share in 2003 included the impacts of the insurance gain, the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stock based compensation discussed above. The impact of expensing stock based compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in 2004, and is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share in 2004 compared with $0.04 per share in 2003. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently 27 Table of Contents known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2003 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2003 that was greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes, the U.S. components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and DBRS are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality 28 Table of Contents products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considered a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In June 2003 the SEC released a Concept Release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws, the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used, and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies. In February 2004, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling on the European Commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in Europe and possible registration criteria. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to all participants in the European capital markets. Credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines. However, depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers, such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some European Union countries. If so, the guidelines could, among other things, alter rating agencies communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, and increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 29 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). 30 Table of Contents In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In July 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the U.S. and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRIs complaint originally alleged damages in excess of $350 million, which IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. In April 2003, the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of IRIs claims and granted in part a motion by IRI seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the Court had previously made in favor of the defendants. In December of 2003, IRI was acquired by the Gingko Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Symphony Technology II A. L. P. and certain other parties. As part of that transaction, a statutory trust called the Information Resources, Inc. Litigation Contingent Payment Rights Trust (the Trust) was formed. The Trust was created, in part, to issue contingent value rights certificates (CVRs), which represent an interest in the IRI lawsuit. The CVRs are governed by a Contingent Value Rights Agreement among IRI and the acquirers, and are a tradeable security listed on the OTC Bulletin Board. As part of the purchase consideration, each IRI stockholder received one CVR for each share of IRI common stock owned, entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the IRI lawsuit, if any, allocated to the Trust. The Trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 68% of any proceeds from the IRI lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than $200 million and 75% of any such proceeds in excess of $200 million. The remaining proceeds, if any, will be the property of IRI. A body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the IRI Litigation on behalf of IRI and CVR holders. Gingko Corporation named two of the rights agents, IRI named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth independent rights agent. Under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, a majority of the rights agents (other than the independent rights agent) must approve any settlement of the IRI lawsuit. The information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by Gingko Acquisition Corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the Trust in connection with the acquisition of IRI. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense 31 Table of Contents Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that: ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the ACN Maximum Amount); and Donnelley and NMR will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. As noted above, ACNielsen is responsible for the IRI Liabilities up to the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment, if any, in IRIs favor (the ACN Payment). The ACN Payment could be less than the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides for each of Donnelley and NMR to pay IRI 50% of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the ACN Payment, and for ACNielsen to issue a secured note (the ACN Note), subject to certain limits, to each of Donnelley and NMR for the amount of their payment. The principal amount of each ACN Note issued to Donnelley and NMR, however, is limited to 50% of the difference between the ACN Maximum Amount and the ACN Payment, and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed 50% of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize ACNielsens claims paying ability. The ACN Notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then NMR and Donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal, and each shall pay 50% of the costs of such bond, if any, which cost will be added to IRI Liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys would be responsible for 25% of the total costs of any bond. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to: any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designated to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring shareholder approval; and payment of interest on the ACN Notes and related fees and expenses. For these purposes, viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such recapitalization plan, the payment of interest on the ACN Notes, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to: pay its debts as they become due; and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan, for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V. VNU N.V. assumed ACNielsens liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU N.V. is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. 32 Table of Contents As a result, the Company will be responsible for the payment of 25% of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount (as adjusted to include VNU N.V.). New DB will be responsible for the payment of an additional 25% (together constituting Donnelleys liability under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement for 50% of such amount) and NMR will be responsible for payment of the remaining 50% of liability in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. In addition, each of the above parties, in accordance with the foregoing percentages, may be required to advance a portion of the amount, if any, by which the ACN Maximum Amount exceeds the amount of the ACN Payment. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of a party to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the IRI Liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing, and although the court earlier set a trial date for September 2004, the court rescinded that date in January 2004 and there is currently no trial date set. Moodys is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the IRI action or the financial condition of ACNielsen and VNU N.V. at the time of any such outcome (and hence the Company cannot estimate the amount of the ACN Payment, the ACN Maximum Amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by VNU N.V. and ACNielsen under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Therefore, Moodys is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if Moodys is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Report. During the third quarter of 2003, New DB filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. 33 Table of Contents Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $57 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, during the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996. During the third quarter of 2003, the partnership filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $50 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph, and Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, New DB participated in meetings with the IRS Appeals Office on the two matters described above. In addition, in the first quarter of 2004, New DB received an Examination Report relating to Old DBs participation in the partnership structure for the first quarter of 1997. In this Report the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax return for the 1997 tax year. New DB also received an Examination Report issued to the partnership with respect to its 1997 tax year. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1997. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS in its Reports and will pursue the same remedies with the same possible consequences described above. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS in relation to the two Examination Reports could be up to approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions During the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Notices of Proposed Adjustment. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $92 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to the partnership transaction entered into in 1997. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. In addition, the IRS proposed to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate 34 Table of Contents to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $125 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. The case is expected to go to trial in 2005. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. On April 29, 2003, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of IMS Health in the arbitration proceeding, awarding IMS Health its full claim plus interest in a decision binding on all parties. As a result, IMS Healths contingent claim against Old DB (and consequently Moodys and New DB) in connection with this matter has been rendered moot. As no amount with respect to this matter had been accrued by Moodys, the arbitration panel ruling is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2003, Moodys had reserves of approximately $126 million with respect to such matters, which reflected an increase of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 relating to the Amortization Expense Deductions matter. Although the matter had previously been under audit, the Company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the Notices of Proposed Adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a formalization by the IRS of its position on the matter. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash 35 Table of Contents flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $331 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. Dividends During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in each year. In December 2003, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2004 dividend of 7.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2004. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2004 was 4,781. Price Per Share Dividends Paid High Low Per Share 2002: First quarter $ 42.00 $ 35.80 $ 0.045 Second quarter 51.74 39.94 0.045 Third quarter 52.40 41.00 0.045 Fourth quarter 50.48 39.80 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2002 $ 52.40 $ 35.80 $ 0.180 2003: First quarter $ 49.70 $ 39.50 $ 0.045 Second quarter 54.85 45.38 0.045 Third quarter 56.80 49.85 0.045 Fourth quarter 60.85 54.85 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2003 $ 60.85 $ 39.50 $ 0.180 36 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moodys business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Those statements appear in the sections entitled Outlook and Contingencies under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, commencing at page 14 of this annual report on Form 10 K, under Legal Proceedings in Item 3, Part I of this Form 10 K, and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words believes, expects, anticipates and other words relating to Moodys views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and or customers; the potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; possible judicial decisions in various jurisdictions regarding the status of and potential liabilities of rating agencies; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Companys global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the outcome of other legal actions to which the Company, from time to time, may be named as a party; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moodys actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations, are described in greater detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward Looking Statements on page 37 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 27. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such 14 Table of Contents cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, deferred revenue included approximately $26 million and $20 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included approximately $26 million and $22 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2003 and 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this managements discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of $16.2 million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($126.4 million at December 31, 2003), and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 15 Table of Contents the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: Future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook. Discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds. Long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments). In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on Moodys pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Pre Assumption Used for tax Expense in 2003 2003 (decrease)/increase Discount Rate 6.75 % ($ 2.5 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 3.91 % $ 1.0 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.10 % ($ 1.0 ) Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. 16 Table of Contents An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pre tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for Amount of Increase in Pre tax Expense in 2003 2003 Assumption (decrease)/increase Expected Dividend Yield 0.41 % 0.10 % ($ 0.1 ) Expected Share Price Volatility 30 % 5 % $ 1.2 Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 years 1.0 year $ 1.1 Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moodys KMV segment is referred to as Moodys Risk Management Services (MRMS), the predecessor business. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. Moodys strong revenue growth was achieved despite expectations early in the year that the Company would encounter a difficult macroeconomic and capital markets environment. The Company benefited from better than expected revenue in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 200 basis points of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million and higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. 18 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 150 basis points of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.5 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This item accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 225 basis points of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Refinancing activity has slowed significantly in recent months, and Moodys expects a decline in this sector in 2004 as discussed below. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year although dollar issuance 19 Table of Contents declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% due primarily to refinancing activity, as spreads tightened and new issuers accessed the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year period. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Moodys expects that public finance issuance and revenue will decline in 2004, as discussed below. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys enhanced analysis initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly for options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 20 Table of Contents MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit decisioning software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003 whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. The Companys revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business, with global structured finance contributing nearly half of the year to year growth. MKMV accounted for $50.7 million of year to year growth, including $42.1 million of revenue from the April 2002 acquisition of KMV. Revenue in the United States was $680.8 million in 2002, an increase of $120.1 million or 21.4% from $560.7 million in 2001. The 2002 increase reflected $85 million of growth in ratings revenue, with higher issuance volumes in several market sectors due to the favorable interest rate environment. Structured finance contributed $66 million of the U.S. ratings revenue growth, with the residential mortgage sector increasing approximately $29 million and other sectors contributing to growth as well. MKMV contributed $23 million of growth, including $19 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. Moodys international revenue was $342.5 million in 2002, an increase of 45.1% from $236.0 million in 2001. International growth was primarily driven by structured finance, with European structured finance growing by over $30 million. MKMV contributed $28 million of growth, including $23 million of post acquisition revenue from KMV. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 33% of total Moodys revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew $45.7 million or 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $26 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. In addition, the April 2002 acquisition of KMV resulted in an increase in operating expenses of $12.2 million compared with the prior year. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up $33.7 million or 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to $23.1 million of expenses related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. Other increases included higher compensation and benefits of $3 million to support business expansion; higher professional fees of $4 million primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems; and higher legal fees of $3 million primarily due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The increase was principally due to $7.5 million of KMV related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. 21 Table of Contents Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moodys operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Companys high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amount in each year included interest expense of $22.8 million related to Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower interest income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $384.3 million in 2002, an increase of $110.5 million or 40.4% from $273.8 million in 2001. The U.S. structured finance business accounted for $66 million of this growth, with nearly $29 million of growth in the residential mortgage sector and over $10 million of growth in revenue from credit derivatives. The largest component of international structured finance revenue growth was Europe, with a year to year increase of over $30 million. The credit derivatives sector was the largest growth driver in Europe. Structured finance revenue in Japan grew approximately $7 million year to year, principally in commercial mortgage backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $227.7 million in 2002, up 0.9% from $225.7 million in 2001. U.S. corporate finance revenue declined $9 million year to year. This reflected a year to year decline of 17% in the number of issues, with weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. Price increases and growth in relationship based revenue partially offset the impact of this decline. European corporate finance contributed approximately $4 million of revenue growth in 2002 despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service starting in January 2002 added approximately $5 million of year to year revenue growth. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $155.0 million in 2002, an increase of $24.3 million or 18.6% from $130.7 million in 2001. In the U.S., growth of $11 million reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short term debt to long term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, revenue increased $8 million as the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year to year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance volumes were strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay as you go financing by municipal borrowers. Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Revenue in the United States grew $12 million year to year, and international revenue increased $10 million, mainly in Europe. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution contributed to the growth. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million or 9.3% over 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $24 million year to year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other 22 Table of Contents expense increases included $4 million for consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, $3 million for legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries and higher rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Included in 2001 expenses was a $3.4 million write down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. The expense increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. The April 2002 acquisition of KMV accounted for $42.1 million of the year to year revenue growth. The remaining $8.6 million of revenue growth reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc credit assessment products as additional country specific models were introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moodys KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001, an increase of $46.6 million. Post acquisition operating expenses of KMV accounted for $35.3 million of the year to year expense growth. The remaining increase principally reflected growth of $5 million in compensation and benefit costs to support growth in the legacy MRMS business, and higher consulting costs related to new product development. Moodys KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year to year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $1.5 million of goodwill amortization, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Moodys KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 15% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 10% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $269.1 million at December 31, 2003, approximately $56.8 million was located outside the United States (with $35.5 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Overview Cash and cash equivalents increased $229.2 million during 2003, to $269.1 million. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, and proceeds from stock plans were $79.0 million. Significant uses of this cash flow were $171.7 million for share repurchases, $107.1 million for the repayment of short term bank debt outstanding at year end 2002, dividend payments of $26.8 million and capital expenditures of $17.9 million. Cash Flow Analysis The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, $334.8 million and $321.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. In addition, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, increases in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 increased by $13.4 million compared with 2001, in part reflecting growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of $12.4 million. Partially offsetting these impacts were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, and higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million). The increase in other liabilities in 2002 included increased reserves related to pension and other post retirement benefits. Net cash used in investing activities was $17.1 million, $223.6 million and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in affiliates. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002 and $9.6 million for Korea Investors Service during 2001. The Company made investments in international rating agencies totaling $5.6 million in 2001. Cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled $17.9 million, $18.1 million and $14.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $227.7 million, $236.6 million and $248.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003 the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the Companys bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $171.7 million in 2003, $369.9 million in 2002 and $267.6 million in 2001. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $79.0 million in 2003, $54.0 million in 2002 and $47.8 million in 2001. In addition, dividends paid were $26.8 million, $27.8 million and $28.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, Moodys funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and the Company has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would 24 Table of Contents result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2003, Moodys had no outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities and $300 million of long term financing payable in October 2005. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2004. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use the majority of its cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. The Company also currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. The continued payment of dividends at this rate is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. As described above, the Company has borrowed from time to time under its bank revolving credit facility and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2004, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies and to satisfy any adverse judgment rendered in the action in France that, in each instance, are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding long term financing of $300 million and a bank revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $107.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. The $300 million of long term financing was secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the Facility) consists of an $80 million 5 year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364 day facility that expires in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the 5 year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2003, such premium was 18 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364 day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5 year facility can range from 7 basis points of the facility amount to 12.5 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 7 basis points at December 31, 2003. The annual fees for the 364 day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility amount. 25 Table of Contents The Company initially borrowed under the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2002 to fund a portion of the acquisition price for KMV, and subsequently repaid those borrowings. During 2002, Moodys also borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short term borrowing costs. Interest paid under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Management may consider pursuing long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moodys completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moodys common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Companys employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Moodys repurchased 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $171.7 million, including 3.2 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2003, Moodys has repurchased 23.0 million shares at a total cost of $881.0 million, including 9.3 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable $ 300.0 $ $ 300.0 $ $ Operating lease obligations 54.5 17.2 21.4 10.8 5.1 Capital lease obligations 2.5 1.2 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (1) 4.0 4.0 Purchase obligations (2) 11.3 5.4 4.8 1.1 Total $ 372.3 $ 23.8 $ 331.5 $ 11.9 $ 5.1 26 Table of Contents (1) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ending December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. Outlook Moodys outlook for 2004 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, consumer spending, corporate profitability and business investment spending, and capital markets issuance activity. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below. The Company expects interest rates in the United States to rise during 2004, with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment. As a result, Moodys expects to see lower issuance in the U.S. corporate bond market, both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector, which posted record issuance in 2003. Despite the issuance declines, revenue from new products and growth in relationship based revenue should produce modest growth in both the U.S. corporate finance and financial institutions sectors. The Company is continuing to introduce the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, consisting of financial reporting, off balance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports, and Moodys plans to cover approximately 350 corporations and financial institutions in North America by the end of 2004. Moodys also expects good growth in consumer spending in 2004. As a result, the Company expects that growth in revenue from rating asset backed securitizations, together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business, will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgage backed securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines. In the public finance ratings business Moodys expects a revenue decline of approximately 20% in 2004, reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and new money borrowings. The Company expects continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects to see double digit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses. The Company is also projecting strong year over year growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business, all producing approximately 20% international revenue growth in ratings and research, including the effects of currency translation. Finally, Moodys expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at Moodys KMV. Moodys expenses for 2004 will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices, technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. The Company will continue investment in the Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Moodys expects its operating margin to decline about 100 basis points in 2004 from the level achieved in 2003 due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin MKMV business. An additional 100 basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stock based compensation. Since the Company adopted expensing of stock based compensation prospectively effective January 1, 2003, the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current four year option vesting period. Overall for 2004, Moodys expects that year over year revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digit percent range. With the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid to high single digit percent range on a reported basis. Reported earnings per share in 2003 included the impacts of the insurance gain, the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stock based compensation discussed above. The impact of expensing stock based compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in 2004, and is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share in 2004 compared with $0.04 per share in 2003. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently 27 Table of Contents known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2003 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2003 that was greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes, the U.S. components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, and DBRS are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality 28 Table of Contents products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considered a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC initiated review of credit rating agencies. In June 2003 the SEC released a Concept Release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws, the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used, and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies. In February 2004, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling on the European Commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in Europe and possible registration criteria. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commissions Market Abuse Directive are applicable to all participants in the European capital markets. Credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines. However, depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers, such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some European Union countries. If so, the guidelines could, among other things, alter rating agencies communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, and increase Moodys cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 29 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old DB, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (Legacy Contingencies) and those that relate to Moodys business and operations (Moodys Matters). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). 30 Table of Contents In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In July 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the U.S. and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRIs complaint originally alleged damages in excess of $350 million, which IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. In April 2003, the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of IRIs claims and granted in part a motion by IRI seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the Court had previously made in favor of the defendants. In December of 2003, IRI was acquired by the Gingko Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Symphony Technology II A. L. P. and certain other parties. As part of that transaction, a statutory trust called the Information Resources, Inc. Litigation Contingent Payment Rights Trust (the Trust) was formed. The Trust was created, in part, to issue contingent value rights certificates (CVRs), which represent an interest in the IRI lawsuit. The CVRs are governed by a Contingent Value Rights Agreement among IRI and the acquirers, and are a tradeable security listed on the OTC Bulletin Board. As part of the purchase consideration, each IRI stockholder received one CVR for each share of IRI common stock owned, entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the IRI lawsuit, if any, allocated to the Trust. The Trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 68% of any proceeds from the IRI lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than $200 million and 75% of any such proceeds in excess of $200 million. The remaining proceeds, if any, will be the property of IRI. A body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the IRI Litigation on behalf of IRI and CVR holders. Gingko Corporation named two of the rights agents, IRI named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth independent rights agent. Under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, a majority of the rights agents (other than the independent rights agent) must approve any settlement of the IRI lawsuit. The information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by Gingko Acquisition Corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the Trust in connection with the acquisition of IRI. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Indemnity and Joint Defense 31 Table of Contents Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that: ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the ACN Maximum Amount); and Donnelley and NMR will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. As noted above, ACNielsen is responsible for the IRI Liabilities up to the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment, if any, in IRIs favor (the ACN Payment). The ACN Payment could be less than the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides for each of Donnelley and NMR to pay IRI 50% of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the ACN Payment, and for ACNielsen to issue a secured note (the ACN Note), subject to certain limits, to each of Donnelley and NMR for the amount of their payment. The principal amount of each ACN Note issued to Donnelley and NMR, however, is limited to 50% of the difference between the ACN Maximum Amount and the ACN Payment, and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed 50% of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize ACNielsens claims paying ability. The ACN Notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then NMR and Donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal, and each shall pay 50% of the costs of such bond, if any, which cost will be added to IRI Liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moodys would be responsible for 25% of the total costs of any bond. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to: any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designated to maximize the claims paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firms ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring shareholder approval; and payment of interest on the ACN Notes and related fees and expenses. For these purposes, viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such recapitalization plan, the payment of interest on the ACN Notes, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to: pay its debts as they become due; and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan, for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V. VNU N.V. assumed ACNielsens liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU N.V. is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old DB and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an agreement (the 1998 Distribution Agreement) whereby Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. 32 Table of Contents As a result, the Company will be responsible for the payment of 25% of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount (as adjusted to include VNU N.V.). New DB will be responsible for the payment of an additional 25% (together constituting Donnelleys liability under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement for 50% of such amount) and NMR will be responsible for payment of the remaining 50% of liability in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. In addition, each of the above parties, in accordance with the foregoing percentages, may be required to advance a portion of the amount, if any, by which the ACN Maximum Amount exceeds the amount of the ACN Payment. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of a party to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the IRI Liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing, and although the court earlier set a trial date for September 2004, the court rescinded that date in January 2004 and there is currently no trial date set. Moodys is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the IRI action or the financial condition of ACNielsen and VNU N.V. at the time of any such outcome (and hence the Company cannot estimate the amount of the ACN Payment, the ACN Maximum Amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by VNU N.V. and ACNielsen under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Therefore, Moodys is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if Moodys is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Report. During the third quarter of 2003, New DB filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. 33 Table of Contents Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $57 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, during the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996. During the third quarter of 2003, the partnership filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $50 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph, and Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, New DB participated in meetings with the IRS Appeals Office on the two matters described above. In addition, in the first quarter of 2004, New DB received an Examination Report relating to Old DBs participation in the partnership structure for the first quarter of 1997. In this Report the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax return for the 1997 tax year. New DB also received an Examination Report issued to the partnership with respect to its 1997 tax year. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1997. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS in its Reports and will pursue the same remedies with the same possible consequences described above. Moodys estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS in relation to the two Examination Reports could be up to approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions During the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Notices of Proposed Adjustment. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure related to this matter is $92 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, New DB received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to the partnership transaction entered into in 1997. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. In addition, the IRS proposed to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate 34 Table of Contents to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New DB could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $125 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old DB responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. The case is expected to go to trial in 2005. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New DB is contesting the IRS assessment. New DB has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moodys does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moodys estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the IMS/NMR Agreement). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old DB in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old DB. Neither Old DB nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. On April 29, 2003, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of IMS Health in the arbitration proceeding, awarding IMS Health its full claim plus interest in a decision binding on all parties. As a result, IMS Healths contingent claim against Old DB (and consequently Moodys and New DB) in connection with this matter has been rendered moot. As no amount with respect to this matter had been accrued by Moodys, the arbitration panel ruling is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2003, Moodys had reserves of approximately $126 million with respect to such matters, which reflected an increase of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 relating to the Amortization Expense Deductions matter. Although the matter had previously been under audit, the Company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the Notices of Proposed Adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a formalization by the IRS of its position on the matter. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash 35 Table of Contents flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $331 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moodys Matters LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by LAssociation Francaise des Porteurs d Emprunts Russes (AFPER) against Moodys France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moodys France SA and Standard Poors SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post Revolutionary repudiation of pre Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moodys believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. Dividends During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in each year. In December 2003, the Companys Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2004 dividend of 7.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2004. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moodys going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moodys Board of Directors. Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Companys common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2004 was 4,781.
