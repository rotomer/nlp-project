MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 41 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 30 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, deferred revenue included approximately $30 million and $26 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included approximately $29 million and $26 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2004 and 2003, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 16 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected charges of $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, to increase the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($131.7 million at December 31, 2004), and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2005 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2005 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for 2005 Operating Income 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate 5.90 % $ (3.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00 % $ 1.2 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35 % $ (1.0 ) 17 Table of Contents Based on our current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $13 million in 2005 compared with $8 million in 2004. The expected expense increase in 2005 reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities, as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience, and assumption changes adopted as of December 31, 2004. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2004 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Amount of Increase in Operating Income in 2004 Assumption Used Assumption (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $0.2 2004 grants 0.46% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% ($2.5) Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year ($2.3) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the 18 Table of Contents Company restated its segment information for prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income obligors and instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $52 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, over $26 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth . Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Reported ratings revenue grew approximately $45 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $8 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of 19 Table of Contents total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by over 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,350 709 2,059 1,258 655 1,913 Moodys KMV 343 75 418 318 69 387 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $ 375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses, and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion, and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $2.86 and $2.79, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 and $2.39, respectively, for 2003. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,310.7 million, up $176.0 million or 15.5% from $1,134.7 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the Euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $538.6 million for 2004, an increase of $78.0 million or 16.9% from $460.6 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market, and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $311.5 million in 2004, up $32.7 million or 11.7% from $278.8 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $26 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector, and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector, and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $169.5 million for 2004 was $42.6 million or 33.6% higher than the $126.9 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $513.7 million in 2004, an increase of $51.5 million or 11.1% from $462.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $37 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing 21 Table of Contents growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.9 million in 2004 versus $15.4 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $780.1 million in 2004 was up $123.0 million or 18.7% from $657.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $127.6 million for 2004 was up $15.7 million or 14.0% from $111.9 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $4 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, including CreditEdge, RiskCalc and Portfolio Manager, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software and training products accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $104.1 million for 2004, an increase of $15.4 million or 17.4% from $88.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $11 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million in both 2004 and 2003. MKMV operating income was $6.3 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. The Company benefited from strong growth in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, with foreign currency translation accounting for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. 22 Table of Contents Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8.0 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million, higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2.8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $8 million of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.8 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. 23 Table of Contents Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This charge accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage and home equity loan sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year, although dollar issuance declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% primarily due to refinancing activity (as spreads tightened) and new issuers accessing the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented approximately 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by 24 Table of Contents growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9.6 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly related to stock options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit processing software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003, whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1.2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. 25 Table of Contents Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 25% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million at December 31, 2004, approximately $102 million was located outside the United States (with $83 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $519.7 million, $468.4 million, and $334.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $51.3 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation, and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Dun Bradstreet, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. Also, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, growth in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. 26 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $24.8 million, $17.1 million and $223.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of capital expenditures, investments in affiliates and acquisitions (most notably the 2002 acquisition of KMV). The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002. Spending for property and equipment and for the capitalization of development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $21.3 million, $17.9 million and $18.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $162.3 million, $227.7 million and $236.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $221.3 million in 2004, $171.7 million in 2003 and $369.9 million in 2002. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.0 million in 2004, $79.0 million in 2003 and $54.0 million in 2002. Dividends paid were $44.7 million, $26.8 million and $27.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 reflects a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in 2004 versus $0.045 per share in 2003 and 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2005. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to a proposed two for one stock split, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, as discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Dividends, then on a post split basis, the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company currently also intends to use the majority of its remaining cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. However, the Company exercises discretion as to when and at what price to repurchase shares. Accordingly, share repurchase activity may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and there may be periods in which the Company does not repurchase shares. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2005, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. In addition, management is currently evaluating refinancing alternatives for its $300 million of notes payable outstanding, which mature in September 2005. It is possible that the Company may not immediately refinance these notes when they mature, in which case their repayment would substantially reduce the Companys cash balance. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 27 Table of Contents Indebtedness At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding $300 million of notes payable. The Company also had in place a $160 million bank revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during 2004. The $300 million of notes payable were secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000 the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. Management is in the process of evaluating refinancing alternatives for the Notes when they mature in September 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Notes have been classified as a current liability. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million 5 year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points, depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2004, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2004. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Agreements also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts due becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited 28 Table of Contents purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 322.8 $ 322.8 $ $ $ Operating lease obligations 65.0 15.7 22.1 15.3 11.9 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (2) 3.7 3.7 Purchase obligations (3) 5.9 2.7 2.8 0.4 Total $ 398.7 $ 346.2 $ 24.9 $ 15.7 $ 11.9 (1) Includes $5.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2004 and $17.1 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, when the notes mature. (2) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ended December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 2005 Outlook Moodys outlook for the full year 2005 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below. In the U.S., the Company expects mid single digit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year 2005. In the U.S. structured finance market, Moodys expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in 2005 from the record level of 2004. The Company expects good year over year growth in several other sectors of U.S. structured finance, including asset backed securities and credit derivatives, and flat to modest growth in asset backed commercial paper and commercial mortgage backed securities. Accordingly, for the full year Moodys expects a modest decline in U.S. structured finance revenue. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company expects that modest growth in investment grade issuance and bank loan ratings, and revenue from our Enhanced Analysis Initiative, will offset relative weakness in speculative grade bond activity, resulting in high single digit percent growth in revenue. Flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the U.S. is expected to be offset by revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new rating relationships, allowing low double digit percent growth in this business in the U.S. in 2005. Moodys expects a second consecutive year of modest year to year revenue decline in U.S. public finance. The Company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of 20%, with double digit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts. The Companys projection assumes improved corporate issuance in Europe after a relatively weak 2004, modest 29 Table of Contents issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in Europe and Japan. In addition, Moodys expects continued strong growth in international research revenue. Finally, the Company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the mid teens percent range at Moodys KMV, reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products. For Moodys overall, the Company expects high single digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2005 including the positive impact of currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stock based compensation to be down approximately 200 basis points in 2005 compared with 2004. This reflects slower revenue growth in 2005 than in 2004 and continued investments in expanding geographically, improving analytic processes, and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the Moodys Investors Service business, introducing new products and improving technology. For 2005 the Company expects that year over year growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the mid teens percent range. This expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in 2004 and the expensing of stock based compensation in 2004 and 2005. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.18 $0.20 per diluted share in 2005, compared to $0.11 per diluted share in 2004. The estimated 2005 impact excludes any effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which will be effective as of July 1, 2005, and is more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2004 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys revenue growth from these sources in 2004 was lower than its growth in 2001 through 2003 as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance, and ratings of U.S. high yield issues and bank credit facilities, was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, 30 Table of Contents geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, DBRS and A.M. Best Company, Inc. are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Numerous market participants, including Moodys, responded to the call for comment. Moodys response can be found on the Companys website at www.moodys.com. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. However, the elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 31 Table of Contents have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Potential for New U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the United States and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies, including the SEC in the United States and the CESR on behalf of the European Union. It is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Such additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency, alter the rating agencies communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate. A description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and other countries is described above under the section entitled Regulation in Item 1, Business, of this Form 10 K. At present, Moodys is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business. 32 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material 33 Table of Contents adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). Under the terms of the distribution agreement relating to the 1996 Distribution (the 1996 Distribution Agreement), each party thereto is prohibited from distributing to its stockholders any business that had been allocated to it in connection with the 1996 Distribution, unless the distributed business delivers an undertaking agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 Distribution Agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 Distribution Agreement. In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Information Resources, Inc. The following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). As more fully described below, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen), AC Nielsen (US), Inc. (ACN (US)), and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties default on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would require the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. Moreover, as described below, on February 1, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against IRI dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on the merits. In July 1996, IRI filed a complaint, subsequently amended in 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (now known as R.H. Donnelly), A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The amended complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleged SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the United States and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and 34 Table of Contents Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRI is seeking in excess of $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI has filed with the Court the report of its expert who has opined that IRI suffered damages of between $582 million and $652 million from the defendants alleged practices. IRI also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount. On June 21, 2004, pursuant to a stipulation between IRI and defendants, the Court ordered that certain of IRIs claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit, including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the SRG acquisition. The Company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages. On December 3, 2004, the Court entered In limine Order No. 1, which bars IRI from arguing that Nielsens pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short run average variable cost, calculated without the inclusion of Nielsens Fixed Operations costs. On December 17, 2004, IRI issued a press release, which said in relevant part, Without this evidence, IRI believes that little would be left of IRIs case to take to trial. IRI asked the Court to enter a final judgment against it, so that it could take an immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Defendants did not object to this request. On February 1, 2005 the Court entered a final judgment dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on February 2, 2005, the Court entered IRIs notice of appeal to the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of June 13, 2005. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V., which assumed ACNielsens obligations under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution, including for any liabilities arising under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. On July 30, 2004, the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health entered into an Amended and Restated Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, any and all IRI Liabilities incurred by Donnelley, Moodys, New DB or IMS Health relating to a judgment (even if not final) or any settlement being entered into in the IRI action will be jointly and severally assumed, and fully discharged, exclusively by the VNU Parties. Under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the VNU Parties have agreed to, jointly 35 Table of Contents and severally, indemnify Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health from and against all IRI Liabilities to which they become subject. As a result, the cap on ACNielsens liability for the IRI Liabilities, which was provided for in the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the VNU Parties pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then the VNU Parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond. In connection with entering into the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health agreed to amend certain covenants of the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to provide operational flexibility for ACNielsen going forward. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of ACNielsen (which, under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, are now also applicable to ACN (US), which the Company understand holds ACNielsens operating assets), which are designed to preserve such parties claims paying ability and protect Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Among other covenants, ACNielsen and ACN (US) agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person, except indebtedness which its payment will, after a payment obligation under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement comes due, be conditioned on, and subordinated to, the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. VNU N.V. has agreed to having a process agent in New York to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As described above, the VNU Parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all IRI Liabilities. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of the VNU Parties to fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the IRI Liabilities. Joint and several liability for the IRI action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing, the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants. This is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made, including the allocations described above between the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Accordingly, and as a result of the allocations of liability described above, in the event the VNU Parties default on their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, each of Moodys and New DB will be responsible for the payment of 50% of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by Donnelley (which is a defendant in the IRI action), which can be as high as all the IRI Liabilities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the IRI action (including the appeal), or the financial condition of any of the VNU parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the Company cannot estimate their ability to pay the IRI Liabilities pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the IRI action. However, provided that the VNU Parties fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the Company believes that the resolution of this matter, irrespective of the outcome of the IRI action, should not materially affect Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if Moodys is required to pay, notwithstanding such contractual obligations, a portion of any significant settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New DB received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New DB also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New DB also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New DB and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1995 and 1996 (the Preliminary Settlement). The Preliminary Settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement. In addition, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS for 1993 and 1994 and plans to file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. If the protest is unsuccessful New DB can either: (1) abandon its tax refund claims; or (2) challenge the IRS claim in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Moodys estimates that its exposure for the write off of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to $9 million. As of June 30, 2004, Moodys had adjusted its reserves for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter to reflect the Companys estimates of probable exposure for the Preliminary Settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph. In accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, New DB was required to obtain the consent of Moodys, IMS Health and NMR as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement, but New DB was unable to obtain consent from IMS Health and NMR. Accordingly, New DB and the IRS were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the November 1st deadline imposed by the IRS. As a result, the IRS withdrew the Preliminary Settlement. 37 Table of Contents The Company believes that in accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, IMS Health and NMR, by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement, would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the Preliminary Settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years 1995 and 1996. IMS Health has alleged various breaches of New DBs obligations under the 1996 Distribution Agreement related to New DBs management and attempted settlement of this matter. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Based on our current understanding of the positions of New DB and IMS Health, the Company believes it is likely that New DB should prevail, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of New DBs preliminary settlement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys has reassessed its exposure for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter taking into consideration: (1) the original Examination Reports discussed above (for which the Companys share of the required payments to the IRS could be up to $103 million, including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits); and (2) the potential write off of deferred tax assets (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Based on this assessment, in 2004, the Company increased its reserve for this matter by $16.4 million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure. Moodys believes that the positions taken by the IRS in the Royalty Reports and the Reallocation Reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other. While it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New DB received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old DB since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports, in which case New DB would also have the aforementioned three courses of action. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $95 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the subsequent years. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys 38 Table of Contents estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS could be up to $129 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New DB had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New DB has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old DB during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed by Old DB for the 1989 and 1990 tax years, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and on September 20, 2000, Old DB filed a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court. In July 2004, New DB and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in December 2004 executed a formal settlement agreement. New DB received the first of three final assessments on February 15, 2005 and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of 2005. Payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of 2005 and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of 2005. Moodys estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately $15 million, reflecting cash payments of approximately $6 million and the write off of deferred tax assets of approximately $9 million. In addition, IMS Health and NMR have notified New DB that they disagree with various aspects of New DBs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Moodys believes that New DB should prevail in its position, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In 2004, Moodys increased its reserves for this matter by $14 million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure. Should IMS Health and NMR prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph, then Moodys estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately $3 million. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. During 2004 , the Company recorded charges of approximately $30 million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters. The Company also recorded approximately $3 million of interest expense related to these reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2004, Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $136 million (consisting of $161 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $25 million of deferred tax assets). The $136 million of expected cash payments consists of $50 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty 39 Table of Contents Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $86 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $354 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2004, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 30 cents during the year. During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 18 cents in each year. On December 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2005. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to the proposed two for one stock split discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, then on a post split basis the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. On February 15, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding and treasury shares. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date. Such additional shares will be distributed on May 18, 2005. The Board of Directors declaration of a special stock dividend distribution is subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares. Moodys stockholders will vote on the charter amendment at the Companys Annual Meeting, which will be held on April 26, 2005. The proposal to amend the Companys charter to increase the number of authorized shares will be more fully described in the Companys annual meeting proxy statement. 40 Table of Contents Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 41 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 30 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, deferred revenue included approximately $30 million and $26 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included approximately $29 million and $26 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2004 and 2003, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 16 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected charges of $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, to increase the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($131.7 million at December 31, 2004), and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2005 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2005 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for 2005 Operating Income 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate 5.90 % $ (3.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00 % $ 1.2 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35 % $ (1.0 ) 17 Table of Contents Based on our current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $13 million in 2005 compared with $8 million in 2004. The expected expense increase in 2005 reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities, as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience, and assumption changes adopted as of December 31, 2004. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2004 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Amount of Increase in Operating Income in 2004 Assumption Used Assumption (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $0.2 2004 grants 0.46% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% ($2.5) Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year ($2.3) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the 18 Table of Contents Company restated its segment information for prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income obligors and instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $52 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, over $26 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth . Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Reported ratings revenue grew approximately $45 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $8 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of 19 Table of Contents total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by over 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,350 709 2,059 1,258 655 1,913 Moodys KMV 343 75 418 318 69 387 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $ 375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses, and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion, and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $2.86 and $2.79, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 and $2.39, respectively, for 2003. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,310.7 million, up $176.0 million or 15.5% from $1,134.7 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the Euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $538.6 million for 2004, an increase of $78.0 million or 16.9% from $460.6 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market, and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $311.5 million in 2004, up $32.7 million or 11.7% from $278.8 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $26 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector, and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector, and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $169.5 million for 2004 was $42.6 million or 33.6% higher than the $126.9 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $513.7 million in 2004, an increase of $51.5 million or 11.1% from $462.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $37 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing 21 Table of Contents growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.9 million in 2004 versus $15.4 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $780.1 million in 2004 was up $123.0 million or 18.7% from $657.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $127.6 million for 2004 was up $15.7 million or 14.0% from $111.9 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $4 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, including CreditEdge, RiskCalc and Portfolio Manager, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software and training products accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $104.1 million for 2004, an increase of $15.4 million or 17.4% from $88.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $11 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million in both 2004 and 2003. MKMV operating income was $6.3 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. The Company benefited from strong growth in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, with foreign currency translation accounting for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. 22 Table of Contents Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8.0 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million, higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2.8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $8 million of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.8 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. 23 Table of Contents Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This charge accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage and home equity loan sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year, although dollar issuance declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% primarily due to refinancing activity (as spreads tightened) and new issuers accessing the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented approximately 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by 24 Table of Contents growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9.6 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly related to stock options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit processing software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003, whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1.2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. 25 Table of Contents Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 25% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million at December 31, 2004, approximately $102 million was located outside the United States (with $83 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $519.7 million, $468.4 million, and $334.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $51.3 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation, and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Dun Bradstreet, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. Also, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, growth in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. 26 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $24.8 million, $17.1 million and $223.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of capital expenditures, investments in affiliates and acquisitions (most notably the 2002 acquisition of KMV). The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002. Spending for property and equipment and for the capitalization of development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $21.3 million, $17.9 million and $18.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $162.3 million, $227.7 million and $236.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $221.3 million in 2004, $171.7 million in 2003 and $369.9 million in 2002. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.0 million in 2004, $79.0 million in 2003 and $54.0 million in 2002. Dividends paid were $44.7 million, $26.8 million and $27.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 reflects a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in 2004 versus $0.045 per share in 2003 and 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2005. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to a proposed two for one stock split, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, as discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Dividends, then on a post split basis, the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company currently also intends to use the majority of its remaining cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. However, the Company exercises discretion as to when and at what price to repurchase shares. Accordingly, share repurchase activity may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and there may be periods in which the Company does not repurchase shares. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2005, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. In addition, management is currently evaluating refinancing alternatives for its $300 million of notes payable outstanding, which mature in September 2005. It is possible that the Company may not immediately refinance these notes when they mature, in which case their repayment would substantially reduce the Companys cash balance. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 27 Table of Contents Indebtedness At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding $300 million of notes payable. The Company also had in place a $160 million bank revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during 2004. The $300 million of notes payable were secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000 the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. Management is in the process of evaluating refinancing alternatives for the Notes when they mature in September 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Notes have been classified as a current liability. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million 5 year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points, depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2004, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2004. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Agreements also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts due becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited 28 Table of Contents purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 322.8 $ 322.8 $ $ $ Operating lease obligations 65.0 15.7 22.1 15.3 11.9 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (2) 3.7 3.7 Purchase obligations (3) 5.9 2.7 2.8 0.4 Total $ 398.7 $ 346.2 $ 24.9 $ 15.7 $ 11.9 (1) Includes $5.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2004 and $17.1 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, when the notes mature. (2) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ended December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 2005 Outlook Moodys outlook for the full year 2005 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below. In the U.S., the Company expects mid single digit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year 2005. In the U.S. structured finance market, Moodys expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in 2005 from the record level of 2004. The Company expects good year over year growth in several other sectors of U.S. structured finance, including asset backed securities and credit derivatives, and flat to modest growth in asset backed commercial paper and commercial mortgage backed securities. Accordingly, for the full year Moodys expects a modest decline in U.S. structured finance revenue. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company expects that modest growth in investment grade issuance and bank loan ratings, and revenue from our Enhanced Analysis Initiative, will offset relative weakness in speculative grade bond activity, resulting in high single digit percent growth in revenue. Flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the U.S. is expected to be offset by revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new rating relationships, allowing low double digit percent growth in this business in the U.S. in 2005. Moodys expects a second consecutive year of modest year to year revenue decline in U.S. public finance. The Company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of 20%, with double digit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts. The Companys projection assumes improved corporate issuance in Europe after a relatively weak 2004, modest 29 Table of Contents issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in Europe and Japan. In addition, Moodys expects continued strong growth in international research revenue. Finally, the Company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the mid teens percent range at Moodys KMV, reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products. For Moodys overall, the Company expects high single digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2005 including the positive impact of currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stock based compensation to be down approximately 200 basis points in 2005 compared with 2004. This reflects slower revenue growth in 2005 than in 2004 and continued investments in expanding geographically, improving analytic processes, and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the Moodys Investors Service business, introducing new products and improving technology. For 2005 the Company expects that year over year growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the mid teens percent range. This expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in 2004 and the expensing of stock based compensation in 2004 and 2005. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.18 $0.20 per diluted share in 2005, compared to $0.11 per diluted share in 2004. The estimated 2005 impact excludes any effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which will be effective as of July 1, 2005, and is more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2004 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys revenue growth from these sources in 2004 was lower than its growth in 2001 through 2003 as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance, and ratings of U.S. high yield issues and bank credit facilities, was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, 30 Table of Contents geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, DBRS and A.M. Best Company, Inc. are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Numerous market participants, including Moodys, responded to the call for comment. Moodys response can be found on the Companys website at www.moodys.com. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. However, the elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 31 Table of Contents have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Potential for New U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the United States and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies, including the SEC in the United States and the CESR on behalf of the European Union. It is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Such additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency, alter the rating agencies communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate. A description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and other countries is described above under the section entitled Regulation in Item 1, Business, of this Form 10 K. At present, Moodys is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business. 32 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material 33 Table of Contents adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). Under the terms of the distribution agreement relating to the 1996 Distribution (the 1996 Distribution Agreement), each party thereto is prohibited from distributing to its stockholders any business that had been allocated to it in connection with the 1996 Distribution, unless the distributed business delivers an undertaking agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 Distribution Agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 Distribution Agreement. In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Information Resources, Inc. The following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). As more fully described below, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen), AC Nielsen (US), Inc. (ACN (US)), and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties default on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would require the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. Moreover, as described below, on February 1, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against IRI dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on the merits. In July 1996, IRI filed a complaint, subsequently amended in 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (now known as R.H. Donnelly), A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The amended complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleged SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the United States and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and 34 Table of Contents Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRI is seeking in excess of $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI has filed with the Court the report of its expert who has opined that IRI suffered damages of between $582 million and $652 million from the defendants alleged practices. IRI also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount. On June 21, 2004, pursuant to a stipulation between IRI and defendants, the Court ordered that certain of IRIs claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit, including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the SRG acquisition. The Company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages. On December 3, 2004, the Court entered In limine Order No. 1, which bars IRI from arguing that Nielsens pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short run average variable cost, calculated without the inclusion of Nielsens Fixed Operations costs. On December 17, 2004, IRI issued a press release, which said in relevant part, Without this evidence, IRI believes that little would be left of IRIs case to take to trial. IRI asked the Court to enter a final judgment against it, so that it could take an immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Defendants did not object to this request. On February 1, 2005 the Court entered a final judgment dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on February 2, 2005, the Court entered IRIs notice of appeal to the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of June 13, 2005. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V., which assumed ACNielsens obligations under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution, including for any liabilities arising under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. On July 30, 2004, the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health entered into an Amended and Restated Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, any and all IRI Liabilities incurred by Donnelley, Moodys, New DB or IMS Health relating to a judgment (even if not final) or any settlement being entered into in the IRI action will be jointly and severally assumed, and fully discharged, exclusively by the VNU Parties. Under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the VNU Parties have agreed to, jointly 35 Table of Contents and severally, indemnify Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health from and against all IRI Liabilities to which they become subject. As a result, the cap on ACNielsens liability for the IRI Liabilities, which was provided for in the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the VNU Parties pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then the VNU Parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond. In connection with entering into the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health agreed to amend certain covenants of the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to provide operational flexibility for ACNielsen going forward. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of ACNielsen (which, under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, are now also applicable to ACN (US), which the Company understand holds ACNielsens operating assets), which are designed to preserve such parties claims paying ability and protect Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Among other covenants, ACNielsen and ACN (US) agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person, except indebtedness which its payment will, after a payment obligation under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement comes due, be conditioned on, and subordinated to, the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. VNU N.V. has agreed to having a process agent in New York to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As described above, the VNU Parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all IRI Liabilities. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of the VNU Parties to fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the IRI Liabilities. Joint and several liability for the IRI action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing, the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants. This is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made, including the allocations described above between the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Accordingly, and as a result of the allocations of liability described above, in the event the VNU Parties default on their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, each of Moodys and New DB will be responsible for the payment of 50% of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by Donnelley (which is a defendant in the IRI action), which can be as high as all the IRI Liabilities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the IRI action (including the appeal), or the financial condition of any of the VNU parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the Company cannot estimate their ability to pay the IRI Liabilities pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the IRI action. However, provided that the VNU Parties fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the Company believes that the resolution of this matter, irrespective of the outcome of the IRI action, should not materially affect Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if Moodys is required to pay, notwithstanding such contractual obligations, a portion of any significant settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New DB received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New DB also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New DB also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New DB and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1995 and 1996 (the Preliminary Settlement). The Preliminary Settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement. In addition, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS for 1993 and 1994 and plans to file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. If the protest is unsuccessful New DB can either: (1) abandon its tax refund claims; or (2) challenge the IRS claim in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Moodys estimates that its exposure for the write off of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to $9 million. As of June 30, 2004, Moodys had adjusted its reserves for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter to reflect the Companys estimates of probable exposure for the Preliminary Settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph. In accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, New DB was required to obtain the consent of Moodys, IMS Health and NMR as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement, but New DB was unable to obtain consent from IMS Health and NMR. Accordingly, New DB and the IRS were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the November 1st deadline imposed by the IRS. As a result, the IRS withdrew the Preliminary Settlement. 37 Table of Contents The Company believes that in accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, IMS Health and NMR, by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement, would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the Preliminary Settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years 1995 and 1996. IMS Health has alleged various breaches of New DBs obligations under the 1996 Distribution Agreement related to New DBs management and attempted settlement of this matter. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Based on our current understanding of the positions of New DB and IMS Health, the Company believes it is likely that New DB should prevail, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of New DBs preliminary settlement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys has reassessed its exposure for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter taking into consideration: (1) the original Examination Reports discussed above (for which the Companys share of the required payments to the IRS could be up to $103 million, including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits); and (2) the potential write off of deferred tax assets (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Based on this assessment, in 2004, the Company increased its reserve for this matter by $16.4 million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure. Moodys believes that the positions taken by the IRS in the Royalty Reports and the Reallocation Reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other. While it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New DB received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old DB since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports, in which case New DB would also have the aforementioned three courses of action. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $95 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the subsequent years. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys 38 Table of Contents estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS could be up to $129 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New DB had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New DB has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old DB during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed by Old DB for the 1989 and 1990 tax years, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and on September 20, 2000, Old DB filed a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court. In July 2004, New DB and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in December 2004 executed a formal settlement agreement. New DB received the first of three final assessments on February 15, 2005 and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of 2005. Payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of 2005 and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of 2005. Moodys estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately $15 million, reflecting cash payments of approximately $6 million and the write off of deferred tax assets of approximately $9 million. In addition, IMS Health and NMR have notified New DB that they disagree with various aspects of New DBs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Moodys believes that New DB should prevail in its position, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In 2004, Moodys increased its reserves for this matter by $14 million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure. Should IMS Health and NMR prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph, then Moodys estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately $3 million. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. During 2004 , the Company recorded charges of approximately $30 million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters. The Company also recorded approximately $3 million of interest expense related to these reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2004, Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $136 million (consisting of $161 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $25 million of deferred tax assets). The $136 million of expected cash payments consists of $50 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty 39 Table of Contents Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $86 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $354 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2004, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 30 cents during the year. During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 18 cents in each year. On December 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2005. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to the proposed two for one stock split discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, then on a post split basis the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. On February 15, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding and treasury shares. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date. Such additional shares will be distributed on May 18, 2005. The Board of Directors declaration of a special stock dividend distribution is subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares. Moodys stockholders will vote on the charter amendment at the Companys Annual Meeting, which will be held on April 26, 2005. The proposal to amend the Companys charter to increase the number of authorized shares will be more fully described in the Companys annual meeting proxy statement. 40 Table of Contents Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 41 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 30 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, deferred revenue included approximately $30 million and $26 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included approximately $29 million and $26 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2004 and 2003, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 16 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected charges of $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, to increase the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($131.7 million at December 31, 2004), and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2005 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2005 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for 2005 Operating Income 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate 5.90 % $ (3.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00 % $ 1.2 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35 % $ (1.0 ) 17 Table of Contents Based on our current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $13 million in 2005 compared with $8 million in 2004. The expected expense increase in 2005 reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities, as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience, and assumption changes adopted as of December 31, 2004. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2004 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Amount of Increase in Operating Income in 2004 Assumption Used Assumption (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $0.2 2004 grants 0.46% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% ($2.5) Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year ($2.3) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the 18 Table of Contents Company restated its segment information for prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income obligors and instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $52 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, over $26 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth . Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Reported ratings revenue grew approximately $45 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $8 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of 19 Table of Contents total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by over 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,350 709 2,059 1,258 655 1,913 Moodys KMV 343 75 418 318 69 387 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $ 375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses, and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion, and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $2.86 and $2.79, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 and $2.39, respectively, for 2003. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,310.7 million, up $176.0 million or 15.5% from $1,134.7 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the Euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $538.6 million for 2004, an increase of $78.0 million or 16.9% from $460.6 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market, and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $311.5 million in 2004, up $32.7 million or 11.7% from $278.8 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $26 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector, and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector, and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $169.5 million for 2004 was $42.6 million or 33.6% higher than the $126.9 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $513.7 million in 2004, an increase of $51.5 million or 11.1% from $462.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $37 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing 21 Table of Contents growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.9 million in 2004 versus $15.4 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $780.1 million in 2004 was up $123.0 million or 18.7% from $657.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $127.6 million for 2004 was up $15.7 million or 14.0% from $111.9 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $4 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, including CreditEdge, RiskCalc and Portfolio Manager, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software and training products accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $104.1 million for 2004, an increase of $15.4 million or 17.4% from $88.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $11 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million in both 2004 and 2003. MKMV operating income was $6.3 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. The Company benefited from strong growth in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, with foreign currency translation accounting for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. 22 Table of Contents Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8.0 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million, higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2.8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $8 million of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.8 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. 23 Table of Contents Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This charge accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage and home equity loan sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year, although dollar issuance declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% primarily due to refinancing activity (as spreads tightened) and new issuers accessing the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented approximately 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by 24 Table of Contents growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9.6 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly related to stock options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit processing software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003, whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1.2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. 25 Table of Contents Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 25% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million at December 31, 2004, approximately $102 million was located outside the United States (with $83 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $519.7 million, $468.4 million, and $334.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $51.3 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation, and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Dun Bradstreet, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. Also, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, growth in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. 26 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $24.8 million, $17.1 million and $223.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of capital expenditures, investments in affiliates and acquisitions (most notably the 2002 acquisition of KMV). The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002. Spending for property and equipment and for the capitalization of development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $21.3 million, $17.9 million and $18.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $162.3 million, $227.7 million and $236.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $221.3 million in 2004, $171.7 million in 2003 and $369.9 million in 2002. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.0 million in 2004, $79.0 million in 2003 and $54.0 million in 2002. Dividends paid were $44.7 million, $26.8 million and $27.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 reflects a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in 2004 versus $0.045 per share in 2003 and 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2005. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to a proposed two for one stock split, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, as discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Dividends, then on a post split basis, the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company currently also intends to use the majority of its remaining cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. However, the Company exercises discretion as to when and at what price to repurchase shares. Accordingly, share repurchase activity may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and there may be periods in which the Company does not repurchase shares. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2005, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. In addition, management is currently evaluating refinancing alternatives for its $300 million of notes payable outstanding, which mature in September 2005. It is possible that the Company may not immediately refinance these notes when they mature, in which case their repayment would substantially reduce the Companys cash balance. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 27 Table of Contents Indebtedness At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding $300 million of notes payable. The Company also had in place a $160 million bank revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during 2004. The $300 million of notes payable were secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000 the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. Management is in the process of evaluating refinancing alternatives for the Notes when they mature in September 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Notes have been classified as a current liability. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million 5 year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points, depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2004, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2004. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Agreements also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts due becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited 28 Table of Contents purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 322.8 $ 322.8 $ $ $ Operating lease obligations 65.0 15.7 22.1 15.3 11.9 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (2) 3.7 3.7 Purchase obligations (3) 5.9 2.7 2.8 0.4 Total $ 398.7 $ 346.2 $ 24.9 $ 15.7 $ 11.9 (1) Includes $5.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2004 and $17.1 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, when the notes mature. (2) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ended December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 2005 Outlook Moodys outlook for the full year 2005 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below. In the U.S., the Company expects mid single digit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year 2005. In the U.S. structured finance market, Moodys expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in 2005 from the record level of 2004. The Company expects good year over year growth in several other sectors of U.S. structured finance, including asset backed securities and credit derivatives, and flat to modest growth in asset backed commercial paper and commercial mortgage backed securities. Accordingly, for the full year Moodys expects a modest decline in U.S. structured finance revenue. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company expects that modest growth in investment grade issuance and bank loan ratings, and revenue from our Enhanced Analysis Initiative, will offset relative weakness in speculative grade bond activity, resulting in high single digit percent growth in revenue. Flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the U.S. is expected to be offset by revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new rating relationships, allowing low double digit percent growth in this business in the U.S. in 2005. Moodys expects a second consecutive year of modest year to year revenue decline in U.S. public finance. The Company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of 20%, with double digit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts. The Companys projection assumes improved corporate issuance in Europe after a relatively weak 2004, modest 29 Table of Contents issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in Europe and Japan. In addition, Moodys expects continued strong growth in international research revenue. Finally, the Company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the mid teens percent range at Moodys KMV, reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products. For Moodys overall, the Company expects high single digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2005 including the positive impact of currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stock based compensation to be down approximately 200 basis points in 2005 compared with 2004. This reflects slower revenue growth in 2005 than in 2004 and continued investments in expanding geographically, improving analytic processes, and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the Moodys Investors Service business, introducing new products and improving technology. For 2005 the Company expects that year over year growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the mid teens percent range. This expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in 2004 and the expensing of stock based compensation in 2004 and 2005. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.18 $0.20 per diluted share in 2005, compared to $0.11 per diluted share in 2004. The estimated 2005 impact excludes any effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which will be effective as of July 1, 2005, and is more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2004 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys revenue growth from these sources in 2004 was lower than its growth in 2001 through 2003 as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance, and ratings of U.S. high yield issues and bank credit facilities, was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, 30 Table of Contents geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, DBRS and A.M. Best Company, Inc. are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Numerous market participants, including Moodys, responded to the call for comment. Moodys response can be found on the Companys website at www.moodys.com. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. However, the elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 31 Table of Contents have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Potential for New U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the United States and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies, including the SEC in the United States and the CESR on behalf of the European Union. It is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Such additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency, alter the rating agencies communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate. A description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and other countries is described above under the section entitled Regulation in Item 1, Business, of this Form 10 K. At present, Moodys is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business. 32 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material 33 Table of Contents adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). Under the terms of the distribution agreement relating to the 1996 Distribution (the 1996 Distribution Agreement), each party thereto is prohibited from distributing to its stockholders any business that had been allocated to it in connection with the 1996 Distribution, unless the distributed business delivers an undertaking agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 Distribution Agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 Distribution Agreement. In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Information Resources, Inc. The following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). As more fully described below, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen), AC Nielsen (US), Inc. (ACN (US)), and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties default on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would require the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. Moreover, as described below, on February 1, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against IRI dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on the merits. In July 1996, IRI filed a complaint, subsequently amended in 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (now known as R.H. Donnelly), A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The amended complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleged SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the United States and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and 34 Table of Contents Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRI is seeking in excess of $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI has filed with the Court the report of its expert who has opined that IRI suffered damages of between $582 million and $652 million from the defendants alleged practices. IRI also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount. On June 21, 2004, pursuant to a stipulation between IRI and defendants, the Court ordered that certain of IRIs claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit, including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the SRG acquisition. The Company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages. On December 3, 2004, the Court entered In limine Order No. 1, which bars IRI from arguing that Nielsens pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short run average variable cost, calculated without the inclusion of Nielsens Fixed Operations costs. On December 17, 2004, IRI issued a press release, which said in relevant part, Without this evidence, IRI believes that little would be left of IRIs case to take to trial. IRI asked the Court to enter a final judgment against it, so that it could take an immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Defendants did not object to this request. On February 1, 2005 the Court entered a final judgment dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on February 2, 2005, the Court entered IRIs notice of appeal to the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of June 13, 2005. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V., which assumed ACNielsens obligations under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution, including for any liabilities arising under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. On July 30, 2004, the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health entered into an Amended and Restated Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, any and all IRI Liabilities incurred by Donnelley, Moodys, New DB or IMS Health relating to a judgment (even if not final) or any settlement being entered into in the IRI action will be jointly and severally assumed, and fully discharged, exclusively by the VNU Parties. Under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the VNU Parties have agreed to, jointly 35 Table of Contents and severally, indemnify Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health from and against all IRI Liabilities to which they become subject. As a result, the cap on ACNielsens liability for the IRI Liabilities, which was provided for in the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the VNU Parties pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then the VNU Parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond. In connection with entering into the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health agreed to amend certain covenants of the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to provide operational flexibility for ACNielsen going forward. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of ACNielsen (which, under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, are now also applicable to ACN (US), which the Company understand holds ACNielsens operating assets), which are designed to preserve such parties claims paying ability and protect Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Among other covenants, ACNielsen and ACN (US) agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person, except indebtedness which its payment will, after a payment obligation under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement comes due, be conditioned on, and subordinated to, the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. VNU N.V. has agreed to having a process agent in New York to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As described above, the VNU Parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all IRI Liabilities. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of the VNU Parties to fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the IRI Liabilities. Joint and several liability for the IRI action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing, the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants. This is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made, including the allocations described above between the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Accordingly, and as a result of the allocations of liability described above, in the event the VNU Parties default on their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, each of Moodys and New DB will be responsible for the payment of 50% of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by Donnelley (which is a defendant in the IRI action), which can be as high as all the IRI Liabilities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the IRI action (including the appeal), or the financial condition of any of the VNU parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the Company cannot estimate their ability to pay the IRI Liabilities pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the IRI action. However, provided that the VNU Parties fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the Company believes that the resolution of this matter, irrespective of the outcome of the IRI action, should not materially affect Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if Moodys is required to pay, notwithstanding such contractual obligations, a portion of any significant settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New DB received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New DB also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New DB also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New DB and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1995 and 1996 (the Preliminary Settlement). The Preliminary Settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement. In addition, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS for 1993 and 1994 and plans to file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. If the protest is unsuccessful New DB can either: (1) abandon its tax refund claims; or (2) challenge the IRS claim in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Moodys estimates that its exposure for the write off of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to $9 million. As of June 30, 2004, Moodys had adjusted its reserves for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter to reflect the Companys estimates of probable exposure for the Preliminary Settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph. In accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, New DB was required to obtain the consent of Moodys, IMS Health and NMR as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement, but New DB was unable to obtain consent from IMS Health and NMR. Accordingly, New DB and the IRS were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the November 1st deadline imposed by the IRS. As a result, the IRS withdrew the Preliminary Settlement. 37 Table of Contents The Company believes that in accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, IMS Health and NMR, by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement, would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the Preliminary Settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years 1995 and 1996. IMS Health has alleged various breaches of New DBs obligations under the 1996 Distribution Agreement related to New DBs management and attempted settlement of this matter. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Based on our current understanding of the positions of New DB and IMS Health, the Company believes it is likely that New DB should prevail, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of New DBs preliminary settlement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys has reassessed its exposure for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter taking into consideration: (1) the original Examination Reports discussed above (for which the Companys share of the required payments to the IRS could be up to $103 million, including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits); and (2) the potential write off of deferred tax assets (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Based on this assessment, in 2004, the Company increased its reserve for this matter by $16.4 million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure. Moodys believes that the positions taken by the IRS in the Royalty Reports and the Reallocation Reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other. While it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New DB received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old DB since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports, in which case New DB would also have the aforementioned three courses of action. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $95 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the subsequent years. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys 38 Table of Contents estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS could be up to $129 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New DB had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New DB has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old DB during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed by Old DB for the 1989 and 1990 tax years, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and on September 20, 2000, Old DB filed a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court. In July 2004, New DB and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in December 2004 executed a formal settlement agreement. New DB received the first of three final assessments on February 15, 2005 and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of 2005. Payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of 2005 and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of 2005. Moodys estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately $15 million, reflecting cash payments of approximately $6 million and the write off of deferred tax assets of approximately $9 million. In addition, IMS Health and NMR have notified New DB that they disagree with various aspects of New DBs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Moodys believes that New DB should prevail in its position, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In 2004, Moodys increased its reserves for this matter by $14 million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure. Should IMS Health and NMR prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph, then Moodys estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately $3 million. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. During 2004 , the Company recorded charges of approximately $30 million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters. The Company also recorded approximately $3 million of interest expense related to these reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2004, Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $136 million (consisting of $161 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $25 million of deferred tax assets). The $136 million of expected cash payments consists of $50 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty 39 Table of Contents Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $86 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $354 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2004, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 30 cents during the year. During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 18 cents in each year. On December 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2005. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to the proposed two for one stock split discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, then on a post split basis the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. On February 15, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding and treasury shares. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date. Such additional shares will be distributed on May 18, 2005. The Board of Directors declaration of a special stock dividend distribution is subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares. Moodys stockholders will vote on the charter amendment at the Companys Annual Meeting, which will be held on April 26, 2005. The proposal to amend the Companys charter to increase the number of authorized shares will be more fully described in the Companys annual meeting proxy statement. 40 Table of Contents Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 41 and Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results on page 30 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (KMV), acquired in April 2002, and Moodys Risk Management Services. Moodys KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old DB separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New DB Corporation (New DB). At that time, Old DB distributed to its shareholders shares of New DB stock. New DB comprised the business of Old DBs Dun Bradstreet operating company (the DB Business). The remaining business of Old DB consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old DB distributed to its shareholders its shares of New DB stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, deferred revenue included approximately $30 million and $26 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included approximately $29 million and $26 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2004 and 2003, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 16 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected charges of $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, to increase the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys goodwill balance is material ($131.7 million at December 31, 2004), and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds long term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Companys assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2005 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2005 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for 2005 Operating Income 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate 5.90 % $ (3.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00 % $ 1.2 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35 % $ (1.0 ) 17 Table of Contents Based on our current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $13 million in 2005 compared with $8 million in 2004. The expected expense increase in 2005 reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities, as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience, and assumption changes adopted as of December 31, 2004. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2004 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Amount of Increase in Operating Income in 2004 Assumption Used Assumption (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $0.2 2004 grants 0.46% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% ($2.5) Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year ($2.3) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Companys total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moodys Risk Management Services to form Moodys KMV, Moodys now operates in two reportable business segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the 18 Table of Contents Company restated its segment information for prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In order to provide additional information relating to Moodys operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moodys Investors Service business consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income obligors and instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $52 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, over $26 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth . Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Reported ratings revenue grew approximately $45 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $8 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of 19 Table of Contents total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by over 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,350 709 2,059 1,258 655 1,913 Moodys KMV 343 75 418 318 69 387 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $ 375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses, and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion, and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $2.86 and $2.79, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 and $2.39, respectively, for 2003. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,310.7 million, up $176.0 million or 15.5% from $1,134.7 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the Euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $538.6 million for 2004, an increase of $78.0 million or 16.9% from $460.6 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market, and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $311.5 million in 2004, up $32.7 million or 11.7% from $278.8 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $26 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector, and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector, and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $169.5 million for 2004 was $42.6 million or 33.6% higher than the $126.9 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $513.7 million in 2004, an increase of $51.5 million or 11.1% from $462.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $37 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing 21 Table of Contents growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.9 million in 2004 versus $15.4 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $780.1 million in 2004 was up $123.0 million or 18.7% from $657.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $127.6 million for 2004 was up $15.7 million or 14.0% from $111.9 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $4 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, including CreditEdge, RiskCalc and Portfolio Manager, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software and training products accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $104.1 million for 2004, an increase of $15.4 million or 17.4% from $88.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $11 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million in both 2004 and 2003. MKMV operating income was $6.3 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moodys pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year to year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. The Company benefited from strong growth in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moodys research business produced very strong results and Moodys KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moodys Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moodys international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year to year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, with foreign currency translation accounting for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moodys total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. 22 Table of Contents Overall, Moodys expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately two thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moodys increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2003 compared with year end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moodys KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, and MKMV. The year to year operating expense increase also reflected $8.0 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moodys had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SGA expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year to year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year to year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million, higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2.8 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year to year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $8 million of reported operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moodys Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moodys KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moodys Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.8 million related to stock based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. 23 Table of Contents Moodys effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from The Dun Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). This charge accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage and home equity loan sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year to year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year to year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year to year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year to year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year to year, although dollar issuance declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year to year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% primarily due to refinancing activity (as spreads tightened) and new issuers accessing the market. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year to year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year to year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short term notes declined year to year. Refinancings represented approximately 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by 24 Table of Contents growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year to year due to lower growth in the Companys operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year to year expense increases included: $9.6 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation (mainly related to stock options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year to year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moodys KMV The following table shows Moodys KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the reported comparisons), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moodys had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the pro forma comparisons), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 MKMVs pro forma year to year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit processing software grew $2 million year to year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003, whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1.2 million related to the Companys change in accounting for stock based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year to year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. 25 Table of Contents Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 25% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million at December 31, 2004, approximately $102 million was located outside the United States (with $83 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short term certificates of deposit or issuers of high grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $519.7 million, $468.4 million, and $334.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $51.3 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation, and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Dun Bradstreet, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year to year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year over year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. Also, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, growth in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year to year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moodys investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year to year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year to year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. 26 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $24.8 million, $17.1 million and $223.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of capital expenditures, investments in affiliates and acquisitions (most notably the 2002 acquisition of KMV). The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002. Spending for property and equipment and for the capitalization of development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $21.3 million, $17.9 million and $18.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $162.3 million, $227.7 million and $236.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $221.3 million in 2004, $171.7 million in 2003 and $369.9 million in 2002. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.0 million in 2004, $79.0 million in 2003 and $54.0 million in 2002. Dividends paid were $44.7 million, $26.8 million and $27.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 reflects a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in 2004 versus $0.045 per share in 2003 and 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2005. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to a proposed two for one stock split, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, as discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Dividends, then on a post split basis, the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company currently also intends to use the majority of its remaining cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. However, the Company exercises discretion as to when and at what price to repurchase shares. Accordingly, share repurchase activity may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and there may be periods in which the Company does not repurchase shares. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2005, to pay to New DB its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. In addition, management is currently evaluating refinancing alternatives for its $300 million of notes payable outstanding, which mature in September 2005. It is possible that the Company may not immediately refinance these notes when they mature, in which case their repayment would substantially reduce the Companys cash balance. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 27 Table of Contents Indebtedness At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding $300 million of notes payable. The Company also had in place a $160 million bank revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during 2004. The $300 million of notes payable were secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moodys was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moodys funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000 the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the Notes) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi annually. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. Management is in the process of evaluating refinancing alternatives for the Notes when they mature in September 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Notes have been classified as a current liability. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million 5 year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points, depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2004, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2004. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Agreements also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts due becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited 28 Table of Contents purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 322.8 $ 322.8 $ $ $ Operating lease obligations 65.0 15.7 22.1 15.3 11.9 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (2) 3.7 3.7 Purchase obligations (3) 5.9 2.7 2.8 0.4 Total $ 398.7 $ 346.2 $ 24.9 $ 15.7 $ 11.9 (1) Includes $5.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2004 and $17.1 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, when the notes mature. (2) This amount reflects Moodys current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three year period ended December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back up facilities, and professional services. 2005 Outlook Moodys outlook for the full year 2005 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below. In the U.S., the Company expects mid single digit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year 2005. In the U.S. structured finance market, Moodys expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in 2005 from the record level of 2004. The Company expects good year over year growth in several other sectors of U.S. structured finance, including asset backed securities and credit derivatives, and flat to modest growth in asset backed commercial paper and commercial mortgage backed securities. Accordingly, for the full year Moodys expects a modest decline in U.S. structured finance revenue. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company expects that modest growth in investment grade issuance and bank loan ratings, and revenue from our Enhanced Analysis Initiative, will offset relative weakness in speculative grade bond activity, resulting in high single digit percent growth in revenue. Flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the U.S. is expected to be offset by revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new rating relationships, allowing low double digit percent growth in this business in the U.S. in 2005. Moodys expects a second consecutive year of modest year to year revenue decline in U.S. public finance. The Company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moodys expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of 20%, with double digit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts. The Companys projection assumes improved corporate issuance in Europe after a relatively weak 2004, modest 29 Table of Contents issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in Europe and Japan. In addition, Moodys expects continued strong growth in international research revenue. Finally, the Company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the mid teens percent range at Moodys KMV, reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products. For Moodys overall, the Company expects high single digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2005 including the positive impact of currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stock based compensation to be down approximately 200 basis points in 2005 compared with 2004. This reflects slower revenue growth in 2005 than in 2004 and continued investments in expanding geographically, improving analytic processes, and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the Moodys Investors Service business, introducing new products and improving technology. For 2005 the Company expects that year over year growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the mid teens percent range. This expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in 2004 and the expensing of stock based compensation in 2004 and 2005. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.18 $0.20 per diluted share in 2005, compared to $0.11 per diluted share in 2004. The estimated 2005 impact excludes any effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which will be effective as of July 1, 2005, and is more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moodys business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moodys revenue in 2004 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moodys revenue growth from these sources in 2004 was lower than its growth in 2001 through 2003 as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance, and ratings of U.S. high yield issues and bank credit facilities, was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Companys results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moodys provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on Moodys business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moodys competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, 30 Table of Contents geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moodys faces increasing competition from SP, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moodys believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moodys, SP, Fitch, DBRS and A.M. Best Company, Inc. are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Numerous market participants, including Moodys, responded to the call for comment. Moodys response can be found on the Companys website at www.moodys.com. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the SECs ongoing review. However, the elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moodys, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moodys. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moodys intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moodys may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moodys success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moodys ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moodys. Moodys also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moodys ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moodys Rating Opinions Moodys faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moodys international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 31 Table of Contents have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Potential for New U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the United States and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies, including the SEC in the United States and the CESR on behalf of the European Union. It is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Such additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency, alter the rating agencies communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate. A description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and other countries is described above under the section entitled Regulation in Item 1, Business, of this Form 10 K. At present, Moodys is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business. 32 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moodys maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moodys to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moodys operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material 33 Table of Contents adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New DB, and the relationship among New DB and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant) (the 1996 Distribution). Under the terms of the distribution agreement relating to the 1996 Distribution (the 1996 Distribution Agreement), each party thereto is prohibited from distributing to its stockholders any business that had been allocated to it in connection with the 1996 Distribution, unless the distributed business delivers an undertaking agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 Distribution Agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 Distribution Agreement. In June 1998, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (Donnelley) (the 1998 Distribution). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (Old DB) through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New DB and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Information Resources, Inc. The following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). As more fully described below, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen), AC Nielsen (US), Inc. (ACN (US)), and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties default on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would require the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. Moreover, as described below, on February 1, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against IRI dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on the merits. In July 1996, IRI filed a complaint, subsequently amended in 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation (now known as R.H. Donnelly), A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation. The amended complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (SRG). IRI alleged SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRIs antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRIs ability to compete within the United States and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and 34 Table of Contents Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRIs access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRIs efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRI is seeking in excess of $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI has filed with the Court the report of its expert who has opined that IRI suffered damages of between $582 million and $652 million from the defendants alleged practices. IRI also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount. On June 21, 2004, pursuant to a stipulation between IRI and defendants, the Court ordered that certain of IRIs claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit, including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the SRG acquisition. The Company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages. On December 3, 2004, the Court entered In limine Order No. 1, which bars IRI from arguing that Nielsens pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short run average variable cost, calculated without the inclusion of Nielsens Fixed Operations costs. On December 17, 2004, IRI issued a press release, which said in relevant part, Without this evidence, IRI believes that little would be left of IRIs case to take to trial. IRI asked the Court to enter a final judgment against it, so that it could take an immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Defendants did not object to this request. On February 1, 2005 the Court entered a final judgment dismissing IRIs claims with prejudice and on February 2, 2005, the Court entered IRIs notice of appeal to the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of June 13, 2005. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to: allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (IRI Liabilities); and conduct a joint defense of such action. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V., which assumed ACNielsens obligations under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, Old DB assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley (then known as The Dun Bradstreet Corporation) arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New DB undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moodys for Old DBs obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution, including for any liabilities arising under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New DB and Moodys, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New DB and Moodys will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. On July 30, 2004, the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health entered into an Amended and Restated Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, any and all IRI Liabilities incurred by Donnelley, Moodys, New DB or IMS Health relating to a judgment (even if not final) or any settlement being entered into in the IRI action will be jointly and severally assumed, and fully discharged, exclusively by the VNU Parties. Under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the VNU Parties have agreed to, jointly 35 Table of Contents and severally, indemnify Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health from and against all IRI Liabilities to which they become subject. As a result, the cap on ACNielsens liability for the IRI Liabilities, which was provided for in the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the VNU Parties pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then the VNU Parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond. In connection with entering into the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health agreed to amend certain covenants of the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to provide operational flexibility for ACNielsen going forward. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of ACNielsen (which, under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, are now also applicable to ACN (US), which the Company understand holds ACNielsens operating assets), which are designed to preserve such parties claims paying ability and protect Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Among other covenants, ACNielsen and ACN (US) agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person, except indebtedness which its payment will, after a payment obligation under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement comes due, be conditioned on, and subordinated to, the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. VNU N.V. has agreed to having a process agent in New York to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As described above, the VNU Parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all IRI Liabilities. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of the VNU Parties to fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the IRI Liabilities. Joint and several liability for the IRI action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing, the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants. This is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made, including the allocations described above between the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moodys, New DB and IMS Health. Accordingly, and as a result of the allocations of liability described above, in the event the VNU Parties default on their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, each of Moodys and New DB will be responsible for the payment of 50% of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by Donnelley (which is a defendant in the IRI action), which can be as high as all the IRI Liabilities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the IRI action (including the appeal), or the financial condition of any of the VNU parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the Company cannot estimate their ability to pay the IRI Liabilities pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the IRI action. However, provided that the VNU Parties fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the Company believes that the resolution of this matter, irrespective of the outcome of the IRI action, should not materially affect Moodys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if Moodys is required to pay, notwithstanding such contractual obligations, a portion of any significant settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old DB and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New DB and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New DB and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New DB and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New DB and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New DB received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New DB received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New DB also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old DB income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New DB also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New DB and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1995 and 1996 (the Preliminary Settlement). The Preliminary Settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement. In addition, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old DB related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS for 1993 and 1994 and plans to file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. If the protest is unsuccessful New DB can either: (1) abandon its tax refund claims; or (2) challenge the IRS claim in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Moodys estimates that its exposure for the write off of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to $9 million. As of June 30, 2004, Moodys had adjusted its reserves for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter to reflect the Companys estimates of probable exposure for the Preliminary Settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph. In accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, New DB was required to obtain the consent of Moodys, IMS Health and NMR as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement, but New DB was unable to obtain consent from IMS Health and NMR. Accordingly, New DB and the IRS were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the November 1st deadline imposed by the IRS. As a result, the IRS withdrew the Preliminary Settlement. 37 Table of Contents The Company believes that in accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, IMS Health and NMR, by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement, would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the Preliminary Settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years 1995 and 1996. IMS Health has alleged various breaches of New DBs obligations under the 1996 Distribution Agreement related to New DBs management and attempted settlement of this matter. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Based on our current understanding of the positions of New DB and IMS Health, the Company believes it is likely that New DB should prevail, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of New DBs preliminary settlement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys has reassessed its exposure for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter taking into consideration: (1) the original Examination Reports discussed above (for which the Companys share of the required payments to the IRS could be up to $103 million, including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits); and (2) the potential write off of deferred tax assets (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Based on this assessment, in 2004, the Company increased its reserve for this matter by $16.4 million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure. Moodys believes that the positions taken by the IRS in the Royalty Reports and the Reallocation Reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other. While it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New DB received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old DB since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New DB disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports, in which case New DB would also have the aforementioned three courses of action. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New DB, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share. In addition, should New DB discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New DB an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New DB had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $95 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New DB continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old DB on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old DB certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New DB disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph. IRS audits of Old DBs or New DBs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the subsequent years. Should any such payments be made by New DB related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New DB its 50% share of New DBs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys 38 Table of Contents estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS could be up to $129 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New DB had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New DB has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old DB and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old DB are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old DB during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed by Old DB for the 1989 and 1990 tax years, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old DB paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moodys and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old DB that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and on September 20, 2000, Old DB filed a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court. In July 2004, New DB and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in December 2004 executed a formal settlement agreement. New DB received the first of three final assessments on February 15, 2005 and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of 2005. Payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of 2005 and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of 2005. Moodys estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately $15 million, reflecting cash payments of approximately $6 million and the write off of deferred tax assets of approximately $9 million. In addition, IMS Health and NMR have notified New DB that they disagree with various aspects of New DBs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moodys understands that New DB anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Moodys believes that New DB should prevail in its position, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In 2004, Moodys increased its reserves for this matter by $14 million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure. Should IMS Health and NMR prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph, then Moodys estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately $3 million. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. During 2004 , the Company recorded charges of approximately $30 million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters. The Company also recorded approximately $3 million of interest expense related to these reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2004, Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $136 million (consisting of $161 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $25 million of deferred tax assets). The $136 million of expected cash payments consists of $50 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty 39 Table of Contents Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $86 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $354 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2004, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 30 cents during the year. During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 18 cents in each year. On December 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2005. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to the proposed two for one stock split discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, then on a post split basis the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. On February 15, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding and treasury shares. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date. Such additional shares will be distributed on May 18, 2005. The Board of Directors declaration of a special stock dividend distribution is subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares. Moodys stockholders will vote on the charter amendment at the Companys Annual Meeting, which will be held on April 26, 2005. The proposal to amend the Companys charter to increase the number of authorized shares will be more fully described in the Companys annual meeting proxy statement. 40 Table of Contents Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
