MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 39 and Item 1A, Risk Factors commencing on page 13 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 19 Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $35 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring period is 26 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial 20 statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $8.8 million and charges of $30.0 million due to changes in the Companys reserves, respectively, for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys also reviewed the MKMV trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finite lived asset beginning in December 2005. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2005 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. 21 Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. Total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of December 31, 2005 were $52.8 million and the Company expects to recognize approximately $3.3 million of such losses in the Companys 2006 net periodic pension expense. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company recognizes these differences over five years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has unrecognized plan asset gains of $0.4 million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2006 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2006 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2006 Estimated Impact on 2006 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.60% / 5.45% $ (4.4 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.6 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.0 ) * Discount rates of 5.60% and 5.45% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected 2006 operating income. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $14.7 million in 2006 compared with $12.3 million (excluding a $3.2 million settlement loss) in 2005. The expected expense increase in 2006 reflects the effects of lower discount rates, normal growth in plan liabilities, the amendment to the Companys healthcare plan to increase Moodys share of future costs, higher compensation for the Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan participants, as well as amortization of actuarial losses. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the current four year option vesting period (or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility), based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. 22 An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2005 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Amount of Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $ 0.4 2004 grants 0.46% 2005 grants 0.52% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% $ (4.5) 2005 grants 23% Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.1) 2005 grants 6.0 years Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 23 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys increased its overall staffing by approximately 390 people or about 16% during 2005. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,617 867 2,484 1,364 716 2,080 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,920 941 2,861 1,693 784 2,477 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions 24 and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included an $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,598.9 million, up $281.4 million or 21.4% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $239.8 million of growth with approximately 81% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $321.8 million for 2005, up $22.2 million or 7.4% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many 25 issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $934.9 million in 2005 was up $152.7 million or 19.5% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $132.7 million for 2005 was $11.9 million or 9.9% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. 26 MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $4.7 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, approximately $27 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business unit contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth. Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Ratings revenue grew approximately $46 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $6 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continued to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by more than 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,364 716 2,080 1,272 662 1,934 Moodys KMV 329 68 397 304 62 366 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys 27 global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflected the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million from an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, for 2003. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,317.5 million, up $177.3 million or 15.5% from $1,140.2 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $553.1 million for 2004, an increase of $78.4 million or 16.5% from $474.7 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of 28 collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $299.6 million in 2004, up $32.9 million or 12.3% from $266.7 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $27 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $173.7 million for 2004 was $43.3 million or 33.2% higher than the $130.4 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $518.0 million in 2004, an increase of $51.8 million or 11.1% from $466.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $36 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.3 million in 2004 versus $15.9 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $782.2 million in 2004 was up $124.1 million or 18.9% from $658.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. 29 Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $120.8 million for 2004 was up $14.4 million or 13.5% from $106.4 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $3 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.8 million for 2004, an increase of $15.1 million or 17.8% from $84.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $13 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.8 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. MKMV operating income was $4.2 million for 2004 compared with $5.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 22 countries outside the United States. Approximately 26% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $486.0 million at December 31, 2005, approximately $119 million was located outside the United States (with $84 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $94.5 million, approximately $18 million was located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2005. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $707.9 million, $526.2 million and $467.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. 30 In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $59.2 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Old D&B, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash used in investing activities was $150.4 million, $31.3 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for property and equipment, internal use software and for development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $31.3 million, $21.3 million and $17.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net investments in marketable securities totaled $88.9 million, $6.5 million and $(1.4) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 spending on investments in affiliates included approximately $25 million related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and the $3.9 million contingent payment made in the second quarter related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies. Net cash used in financing activities was $666.5 million, $162.3 million and $227.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $691.7 million in 2005, $221.3 million in 2004 and $171.7 million in 2003. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $89.1 million in 2005, $105.0 million in 2004 and $79.0 million in 2003. Dividends paid were $60.3 million, $44.7 million and $26.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus $0.0375 per share in 2004 and $0.0225 per share in 2003. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2006. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends, of which the Board of Directors declared a quarterly amount of $0.07 per share on December 13, 2005 payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow after dividends to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Systematic share repurchases may constitute the majority of the 31 Companys potential repurchase activity. Moodys will also be prepared to act opportunistically when conditions warrant. On October 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2005, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2005. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with 32 such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 449.4 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 374.7 Operating lease obligations 63.9 16.7 24.0 12.5 10.7 Purchase obligations (2) 6.5 4.3 2.2 Total $ 519.8 $ 35.9 $ 56.1 $ 42.4 $ 385.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2005 and $145.7 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for data processing services, data back up facilities and professional services. 2006 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects revenue growth in the high single digit to double digit percent range for the full year 2006, including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stock based compensation to decline by up to 150 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. This reflects investments the Company is continuing to make to expand internationally, improve analytical processes, pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure. For 2006, Moodys projects year over year growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share in the high single digit to double digit percent range. This expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005, and the expensing of stock based compensation in both 2005 and 2006. 2006 represents the final 33 year of phasing for stock based compensation, which began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.12 $0.14 per diluted share in 2006, compared to $0.10 per diluted share in 2005. In the U.S., the Company is forecasting mid single digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business unit for the full year 2006. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of 2005. The Company is projecting a high teens percent decline from 2005 to 2006 in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities, including home equity securitization, and notes a divergence in market views about the 2006 outlook for this business. Offsetting this expected decline, Moodys looks for double digit year over year growth in asset backed securities, credit derivatives, and commercial mortgage backed securities. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance, gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market, and incremental revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector. Overall, Moodys expects revenue in the U.S. corporate finance business to grow in the low double digit percent range for the year. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in 2006 compared with 2005 and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down. However, fee increases partly related to the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, as well as expected new ratings mandates, should produce revenue growth for the year in the low double digit percent range. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in 2006 than 2005. The Company forecasts revenue for 2006 declining in the mid single digit percent range from the prior year. Moodys forecasts strong growth in the U.S. research business unit at about twenty percent. Outside the U.S., the Company expects ratings revenue to grow in the low teens percent range with high single digit to mid teens percent growth in all major business lines. This forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year. In addition, the outlook assumes low and mid teens percentage growth in corporate revenue in Europe and Asia, respectively. For the financial institutions business Moodys expects to see high single digit revenue growth in Europe, after a year of very strong issuance in 2005, and low double digit percent growth in Asia. The Company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software, and professional services. This should result in mid to high single digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. 34 Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. Information Resources, Inc. An antitrust lawsuit was filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). A detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the SEC. As previously disclosed, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation, AC Nielsen (US), Inc., and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the July 30, 2004 Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties defaulted on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would have required the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. On February 16, 2006, the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties. Such releases will also include the Company, although not a defendant in the litigation, as a releasee. Any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the VNU Parties, and the Company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment. The dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New D&B and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow 35 certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New D&B also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New D&B and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1995 and 1996. The IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. The settlement was withdrawn by the IRS in November 2004. As a result of these events, the Company increased its reserves for this matter by $30 million in 2004. In 2005, New D&B, Moodys, IMS Health and NMR executed a closing agreement with the IRS reflecting terms originally agreed to in June 2004. After executing the closing agreement, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement. As a result, New D&B and Moodys each increased its share of the assessment by $7.3 million to $35.5 million and Moodys paid approximately $34 million of this amount in October of 2005. These events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of $11.5 million. New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the incremental amounts New D&B and Moodys were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions which New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B should prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of the closing agreement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRS denial of certain tax refunds owing Old D&B for 1993 and 1994. Moodys estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter could be up to $16 million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement, which takes into consideration: (1) the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and (2) the potential write off of receivables (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar 36 Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years, described below, in which case New D&B has the aforementioned three courses of action. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $101 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this Amortization Expense Deductions section. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below. Similar Examination Reports could result for years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&Bs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to $135 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New D&B has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. On May 6, 2005, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (Notice) from the IRS for the 1999 2002 tax years which (1) disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and to New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns and (2) disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns. On August 4, 2005, New D&B received an Examination Report (the August Examination Report) from the IRS disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns consistent with the Notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty. New D&B has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the August Examination Report. Currently, the Company does not expect that the Notice or the Examination Report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys believes that the IRS proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. 37 Utilization of Capital Losses In July 2004, New D&B and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005, and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment. Moodys paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of $12.8 million ($8.1 million net of expected tax benefits) and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately $9 million. Moodys remaining liability at December 31, 2005 was approximately $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If New D&B fails to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, Moodys understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its reserves by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an $8.8 million net reversal of reserves of which $2.7 million related to an increase for the Utilization of Capital Losses matter and $11.5 million related to the reversal for the Royalty Expense Deductions described above. The Company has recorded $5.8 million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves. Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $97 million (consisting of $106 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $9 million of tax receivables). The $97 million of expected cash payments consists of $8 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $89 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $252 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 and $0.0225 per share, respectively, of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15 and $0.09, respectively. On December 13, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 38 Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 19 Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $35 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring period is 26 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial 20 statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $8.8 million and charges of $30.0 million due to changes in the Companys reserves, respectively, for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys also reviewed the MKMV trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finite lived asset beginning in December 2005. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2005 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. 21 Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. Total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of December 31, 2005 were $52.8 million and the Company expects to recognize approximately $3.3 million of such losses in the Companys 2006 net periodic pension expense. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company recognizes these differences over five years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has unrecognized plan asset gains of $0.4 million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2006 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2006 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2006 Estimated Impact on 2006 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.60% / 5.45% $ (4.4 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.6 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.0 ) * Discount rates of 5.60% and 5.45% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected 2006 operating income. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $14.7 million in 2006 compared with $12.3 million (excluding a $3.2 million settlement loss) in 2005. The expected expense increase in 2006 reflects the effects of lower discount rates, normal growth in plan liabilities, the amendment to the Companys healthcare plan to increase Moodys share of future costs, higher compensation for the Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan participants, as well as amortization of actuarial losses. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the current four year option vesting period (or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility), based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. 22 An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2005 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Amount of Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $ 0.4 2004 grants 0.46% 2005 grants 0.52% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% $ (4.5) 2005 grants 23% Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.1) 2005 grants 6.0 years Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 23 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys increased its overall staffing by approximately 390 people or about 16% during 2005. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,617 867 2,484 1,364 716 2,080 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,920 941 2,861 1,693 784 2,477 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions 24 and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included an $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,598.9 million, up $281.4 million or 21.4% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $239.8 million of growth with approximately 81% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $321.8 million for 2005, up $22.2 million or 7.4% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many 25 issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $934.9 million in 2005 was up $152.7 million or 19.5% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $132.7 million for 2005 was $11.9 million or 9.9% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. 26 MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $4.7 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, approximately $27 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business unit contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth. Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Ratings revenue grew approximately $46 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $6 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continued to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by more than 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,364 716 2,080 1,272 662 1,934 Moodys KMV 329 68 397 304 62 366 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys 27 global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflected the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million from an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, for 2003. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,317.5 million, up $177.3 million or 15.5% from $1,140.2 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $553.1 million for 2004, an increase of $78.4 million or 16.5% from $474.7 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of 28 collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $299.6 million in 2004, up $32.9 million or 12.3% from $266.7 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $27 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $173.7 million for 2004 was $43.3 million or 33.2% higher than the $130.4 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $518.0 million in 2004, an increase of $51.8 million or 11.1% from $466.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $36 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.3 million in 2004 versus $15.9 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $782.2 million in 2004 was up $124.1 million or 18.9% from $658.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. 29 Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $120.8 million for 2004 was up $14.4 million or 13.5% from $106.4 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $3 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.8 million for 2004, an increase of $15.1 million or 17.8% from $84.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $13 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.8 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. MKMV operating income was $4.2 million for 2004 compared with $5.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 22 countries outside the United States. Approximately 26% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $486.0 million at December 31, 2005, approximately $119 million was located outside the United States (with $84 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $94.5 million, approximately $18 million was located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2005. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $707.9 million, $526.2 million and $467.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. 30 In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $59.2 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Old D&B, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash used in investing activities was $150.4 million, $31.3 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for property and equipment, internal use software and for development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $31.3 million, $21.3 million and $17.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net investments in marketable securities totaled $88.9 million, $6.5 million and $(1.4) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 spending on investments in affiliates included approximately $25 million related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and the $3.9 million contingent payment made in the second quarter related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies. Net cash used in financing activities was $666.5 million, $162.3 million and $227.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $691.7 million in 2005, $221.3 million in 2004 and $171.7 million in 2003. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $89.1 million in 2005, $105.0 million in 2004 and $79.0 million in 2003. Dividends paid were $60.3 million, $44.7 million and $26.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus $0.0375 per share in 2004 and $0.0225 per share in 2003. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2006. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends, of which the Board of Directors declared a quarterly amount of $0.07 per share on December 13, 2005 payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow after dividends to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Systematic share repurchases may constitute the majority of the 31 Companys potential repurchase activity. Moodys will also be prepared to act opportunistically when conditions warrant. On October 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2005, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2005. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with 32 such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 449.4 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 374.7 Operating lease obligations 63.9 16.7 24.0 12.5 10.7 Purchase obligations (2) 6.5 4.3 2.2 Total $ 519.8 $ 35.9 $ 56.1 $ 42.4 $ 385.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2005 and $145.7 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for data processing services, data back up facilities and professional services. 2006 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects revenue growth in the high single digit to double digit percent range for the full year 2006, including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stock based compensation to decline by up to 150 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. This reflects investments the Company is continuing to make to expand internationally, improve analytical processes, pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure. For 2006, Moodys projects year over year growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share in the high single digit to double digit percent range. This expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005, and the expensing of stock based compensation in both 2005 and 2006. 2006 represents the final 33 year of phasing for stock based compensation, which began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.12 $0.14 per diluted share in 2006, compared to $0.10 per diluted share in 2005. In the U.S., the Company is forecasting mid single digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business unit for the full year 2006. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of 2005. The Company is projecting a high teens percent decline from 2005 to 2006 in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities, including home equity securitization, and notes a divergence in market views about the 2006 outlook for this business. Offsetting this expected decline, Moodys looks for double digit year over year growth in asset backed securities, credit derivatives, and commercial mortgage backed securities. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance, gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market, and incremental revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector. Overall, Moodys expects revenue in the U.S. corporate finance business to grow in the low double digit percent range for the year. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in 2006 compared with 2005 and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down. However, fee increases partly related to the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, as well as expected new ratings mandates, should produce revenue growth for the year in the low double digit percent range. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in 2006 than 2005. The Company forecasts revenue for 2006 declining in the mid single digit percent range from the prior year. Moodys forecasts strong growth in the U.S. research business unit at about twenty percent. Outside the U.S., the Company expects ratings revenue to grow in the low teens percent range with high single digit to mid teens percent growth in all major business lines. This forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year. In addition, the outlook assumes low and mid teens percentage growth in corporate revenue in Europe and Asia, respectively. For the financial institutions business Moodys expects to see high single digit revenue growth in Europe, after a year of very strong issuance in 2005, and low double digit percent growth in Asia. The Company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software, and professional services. This should result in mid to high single digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. 34 Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. Information Resources, Inc. An antitrust lawsuit was filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). A detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the SEC. As previously disclosed, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation, AC Nielsen (US), Inc., and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the July 30, 2004 Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties defaulted on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would have required the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. On February 16, 2006, the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties. Such releases will also include the Company, although not a defendant in the litigation, as a releasee. Any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the VNU Parties, and the Company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment. The dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New D&B and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow 35 certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New D&B also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New D&B and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1995 and 1996. The IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. The settlement was withdrawn by the IRS in November 2004. As a result of these events, the Company increased its reserves for this matter by $30 million in 2004. In 2005, New D&B, Moodys, IMS Health and NMR executed a closing agreement with the IRS reflecting terms originally agreed to in June 2004. After executing the closing agreement, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement. As a result, New D&B and Moodys each increased its share of the assessment by $7.3 million to $35.5 million and Moodys paid approximately $34 million of this amount in October of 2005. These events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of $11.5 million. New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the incremental amounts New D&B and Moodys were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions which New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B should prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of the closing agreement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRS denial of certain tax refunds owing Old D&B for 1993 and 1994. Moodys estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter could be up to $16 million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement, which takes into consideration: (1) the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and (2) the potential write off of receivables (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar 36 Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years, described below, in which case New D&B has the aforementioned three courses of action. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $101 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this Amortization Expense Deductions section. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below. Similar Examination Reports could result for years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&Bs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to $135 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New D&B has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. On May 6, 2005, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (Notice) from the IRS for the 1999 2002 tax years which (1) disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and to New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns and (2) disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns. On August 4, 2005, New D&B received an Examination Report (the August Examination Report) from the IRS disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns consistent with the Notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty. New D&B has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the August Examination Report. Currently, the Company does not expect that the Notice or the Examination Report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys believes that the IRS proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. 37 Utilization of Capital Losses In July 2004, New D&B and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005, and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment. Moodys paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of $12.8 million ($8.1 million net of expected tax benefits) and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately $9 million. Moodys remaining liability at December 31, 2005 was approximately $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If New D&B fails to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, Moodys understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its reserves by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an $8.8 million net reversal of reserves of which $2.7 million related to an increase for the Utilization of Capital Losses matter and $11.5 million related to the reversal for the Royalty Expense Deductions described above. The Company has recorded $5.8 million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves. Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $97 million (consisting of $106 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $9 million of tax receivables). The $97 million of expected cash payments consists of $8 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $89 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $252 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 and $0.0225 per share, respectively, of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15 and $0.09, respectively. On December 13, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 38 Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 39 and Item 1A, Risk Factors commencing on page 13 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 19 Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $35 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring period is 26 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial 20 statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $8.8 million and charges of $30.0 million due to changes in the Companys reserves, respectively, for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys also reviewed the MKMV trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finite lived asset beginning in December 2005. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2005 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. 21 Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. Total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of December 31, 2005 were $52.8 million and the Company expects to recognize approximately $3.3 million of such losses in the Companys 2006 net periodic pension expense. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company recognizes these differences over five years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has unrecognized plan asset gains of $0.4 million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2006 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2006 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2006 Estimated Impact on 2006 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.60% / 5.45% $ (4.4 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.6 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.0 ) * Discount rates of 5.60% and 5.45% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected 2006 operating income. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $14.7 million in 2006 compared with $12.3 million (excluding a $3.2 million settlement loss) in 2005. The expected expense increase in 2006 reflects the effects of lower discount rates, normal growth in plan liabilities, the amendment to the Companys healthcare plan to increase Moodys share of future costs, higher compensation for the Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan participants, as well as amortization of actuarial losses. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the current four year option vesting period (or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility), based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. 22 An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2005 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Amount of Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $ 0.4 2004 grants 0.46% 2005 grants 0.52% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% $ (4.5) 2005 grants 23% Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.1) 2005 grants 6.0 years Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 23 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys increased its overall staffing by approximately 390 people or about 16% during 2005. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,617 867 2,484 1,364 716 2,080 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,920 941 2,861 1,693 784 2,477 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions 24 and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included an $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,598.9 million, up $281.4 million or 21.4% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $239.8 million of growth with approximately 81% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $321.8 million for 2005, up $22.2 million or 7.4% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many 25 issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $934.9 million in 2005 was up $152.7 million or 19.5% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $132.7 million for 2005 was $11.9 million or 9.9% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. 26 MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $4.7 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, approximately $27 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business unit contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth. Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Ratings revenue grew approximately $46 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $6 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continued to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by more than 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,364 716 2,080 1,272 662 1,934 Moodys KMV 329 68 397 304 62 366 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys 27 global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflected the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million from an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, for 2003. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,317.5 million, up $177.3 million or 15.5% from $1,140.2 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $553.1 million for 2004, an increase of $78.4 million or 16.5% from $474.7 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of 28 collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $299.6 million in 2004, up $32.9 million or 12.3% from $266.7 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $27 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $173.7 million for 2004 was $43.3 million or 33.2% higher than the $130.4 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $518.0 million in 2004, an increase of $51.8 million or 11.1% from $466.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $36 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.3 million in 2004 versus $15.9 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $782.2 million in 2004 was up $124.1 million or 18.9% from $658.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. 29 Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $120.8 million for 2004 was up $14.4 million or 13.5% from $106.4 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $3 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.8 million for 2004, an increase of $15.1 million or 17.8% from $84.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $13 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.8 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. MKMV operating income was $4.2 million for 2004 compared with $5.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 22 countries outside the United States. Approximately 26% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $486.0 million at December 31, 2005, approximately $119 million was located outside the United States (with $84 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $94.5 million, approximately $18 million was located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2005. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $707.9 million, $526.2 million and $467.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. 30 In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $59.2 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Old D&B, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash used in investing activities was $150.4 million, $31.3 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for property and equipment, internal use software and for development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $31.3 million, $21.3 million and $17.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net investments in marketable securities totaled $88.9 million, $6.5 million and $(1.4) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 spending on investments in affiliates included approximately $25 million related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and the $3.9 million contingent payment made in the second quarter related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies. Net cash used in financing activities was $666.5 million, $162.3 million and $227.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $691.7 million in 2005, $221.3 million in 2004 and $171.7 million in 2003. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $89.1 million in 2005, $105.0 million in 2004 and $79.0 million in 2003. Dividends paid were $60.3 million, $44.7 million and $26.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus $0.0375 per share in 2004 and $0.0225 per share in 2003. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2006. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends, of which the Board of Directors declared a quarterly amount of $0.07 per share on December 13, 2005 payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow after dividends to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Systematic share repurchases may constitute the majority of the 31 Companys potential repurchase activity. Moodys will also be prepared to act opportunistically when conditions warrant. On October 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2005, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2005. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with 32 such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 449.4 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 374.7 Operating lease obligations 63.9 16.7 24.0 12.5 10.7 Purchase obligations (2) 6.5 4.3 2.2 Total $ 519.8 $ 35.9 $ 56.1 $ 42.4 $ 385.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2005 and $145.7 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for data processing services, data back up facilities and professional services. 2006 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects revenue growth in the high single digit to double digit percent range for the full year 2006, including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stock based compensation to decline by up to 150 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. This reflects investments the Company is continuing to make to expand internationally, improve analytical processes, pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure. For 2006, Moodys projects year over year growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share in the high single digit to double digit percent range. This expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005, and the expensing of stock based compensation in both 2005 and 2006. 2006 represents the final 33 year of phasing for stock based compensation, which began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.12 $0.14 per diluted share in 2006, compared to $0.10 per diluted share in 2005. In the U.S., the Company is forecasting mid single digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business unit for the full year 2006. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of 2005. The Company is projecting a high teens percent decline from 2005 to 2006 in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities, including home equity securitization, and notes a divergence in market views about the 2006 outlook for this business. Offsetting this expected decline, Moodys looks for double digit year over year growth in asset backed securities, credit derivatives, and commercial mortgage backed securities. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance, gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market, and incremental revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector. Overall, Moodys expects revenue in the U.S. corporate finance business to grow in the low double digit percent range for the year. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in 2006 compared with 2005 and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down. However, fee increases partly related to the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, as well as expected new ratings mandates, should produce revenue growth for the year in the low double digit percent range. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in 2006 than 2005. The Company forecasts revenue for 2006 declining in the mid single digit percent range from the prior year. Moodys forecasts strong growth in the U.S. research business unit at about twenty percent. Outside the U.S., the Company expects ratings revenue to grow in the low teens percent range with high single digit to mid teens percent growth in all major business lines. This forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year. In addition, the outlook assumes low and mid teens percentage growth in corporate revenue in Europe and Asia, respectively. For the financial institutions business Moodys expects to see high single digit revenue growth in Europe, after a year of very strong issuance in 2005, and low double digit percent growth in Asia. The Company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software, and professional services. This should result in mid to high single digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. 34 Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. Information Resources, Inc. An antitrust lawsuit was filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). A detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the SEC. As previously disclosed, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation, AC Nielsen (US), Inc., and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the July 30, 2004 Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties defaulted on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would have required the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. On February 16, 2006, the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties. Such releases will also include the Company, although not a defendant in the litigation, as a releasee. Any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the VNU Parties, and the Company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment. The dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New D&B and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow 35 certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New D&B also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New D&B and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1995 and 1996. The IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. The settlement was withdrawn by the IRS in November 2004. As a result of these events, the Company increased its reserves for this matter by $30 million in 2004. In 2005, New D&B, Moodys, IMS Health and NMR executed a closing agreement with the IRS reflecting terms originally agreed to in June 2004. After executing the closing agreement, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement. As a result, New D&B and Moodys each increased its share of the assessment by $7.3 million to $35.5 million and Moodys paid approximately $34 million of this amount in October of 2005. These events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of $11.5 million. New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the incremental amounts New D&B and Moodys were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions which New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B should prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of the closing agreement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRS denial of certain tax refunds owing Old D&B for 1993 and 1994. Moodys estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter could be up to $16 million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement, which takes into consideration: (1) the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and (2) the potential write off of receivables (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar 36 Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years, described below, in which case New D&B has the aforementioned three courses of action. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $101 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this Amortization Expense Deductions section. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below. Similar Examination Reports could result for years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&Bs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to $135 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New D&B has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. On May 6, 2005, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (Notice) from the IRS for the 1999 2002 tax years which (1) disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and to New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns and (2) disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns. On August 4, 2005, New D&B received an Examination Report (the August Examination Report) from the IRS disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns consistent with the Notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty. New D&B has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the August Examination Report. Currently, the Company does not expect that the Notice or the Examination Report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys believes that the IRS proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. 37 Utilization of Capital Losses In July 2004, New D&B and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005, and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment. Moodys paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of $12.8 million ($8.1 million net of expected tax benefits) and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately $9 million. Moodys remaining liability at December 31, 2005 was approximately $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If New D&B fails to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, Moodys understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its reserves by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an $8.8 million net reversal of reserves of which $2.7 million related to an increase for the Utilization of Capital Losses matter and $11.5 million related to the reversal for the Royalty Expense Deductions described above. The Company has recorded $5.8 million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves. Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $97 million (consisting of $106 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $9 million of tax receivables). The $97 million of expected cash payments consists of $8 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $89 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $252 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 and $0.0225 per share, respectively, of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15 and $0.09, respectively. On December 13, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 38 Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 39 and Item 1A, Risk Factors commencing on page 13 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit research, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 19 Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $35 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring period is 26 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial 20 statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $8.8 million and charges of $30.0 million due to changes in the Companys reserves, respectively, for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Moodys also reviewed the MKMV trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finite lived asset beginning in December 2005. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2005 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. 21 Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. Total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of December 31, 2005 were $52.8 million and the Company expects to recognize approximately $3.3 million of such losses in the Companys 2006 net periodic pension expense. Differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company recognizes these differences over five years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has unrecognized plan asset gains of $0.4 million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2006 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2006 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2006 Estimated Impact on 2006 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.60% / 5.45% $ (4.4 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.6 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.0 ) * Discount rates of 5.60% and 5.45% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected 2006 operating income. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately $14.7 million in 2006 compared with $12.3 million (excluding a $3.2 million settlement loss) in 2005. The expected expense increase in 2006 reflects the effects of lower discount rates, normal growth in plan liabilities, the amendment to the Companys healthcare plan to increase Moodys share of future costs, higher compensation for the Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan participants, as well as amortization of actuarial losses. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the current four year option vesting period (or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility), based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. 22 An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2005 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Amount of Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $ 0.4 2004 grants 0.46% 2005 grants 0.52% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% $ (4.5) 2005 grants 23% Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.1) 2005 grants 6.0 years Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 23 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys increased its overall staffing by approximately 390 people or about 16% during 2005. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,617 867 2,484 1,364 716 2,080 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,920 941 2,861 1,693 784 2,477 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions 24 and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included an $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,598.9 million, up $281.4 million or 21.4% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $239.8 million of growth with approximately 81% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $321.8 million for 2005, up $22.2 million or 7.4% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many 25 issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $934.9 million in 2005 was up $152.7 million or 19.5% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $132.7 million for 2005 was $11.9 million or 9.9% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. 26 MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $4.7 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, approximately $27 million of Moodys U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business unit contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moodys United States growth. Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year to year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moodys international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Ratings revenue grew approximately $46 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $6 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continued to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moodys increased its overall staffing by more than 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2004 compared with year end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,364 716 2,080 1,272 662 1,934 Moodys KMV 329 68 397 304 62 366 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys 27 global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moodys U.S. and international ratings businesses and at Moodys KMV. Stock based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense principally reflected the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and $4.7 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better than expected revenue growth. Moodys reported $15.1 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million from an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moodys effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, for 2003. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Moodys Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,317.5 million, up $177.3 million or 15.5% from $1,140.2 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the euro. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $553.1 million for 2004, an increase of $78.4 million or 16.5% from $474.7 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of 28 collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year to year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $299.6 million in 2004, up $32.9 million or 12.3% from $266.7 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $27 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year to year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year to year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year to year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $173.7 million for 2004 was $43.3 million or 33.2% higher than the $130.4 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year to year growth in reported revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $518.0 million in 2004, an increase of $51.8 million or 11.1% from $466.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $36 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year to year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.3 million in 2004 versus $15.9 million in 2003. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $782.2 million in 2004 was up $124.1 million or 18.9% from $658.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year to year growth in operating income. 29 Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $120.8 million for 2004 was up $14.4 million or 13.5% from $106.4 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $3 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMVs global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMVs credit processing software accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.8 million for 2004, an increase of $15.1 million or 17.8% from $84.7 million for 2003. The year to year increase primarily reflected growth of $13 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.8 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. MKMV operating income was $4.2 million for 2004 compared with $5.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year to year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 22 countries outside the United States. Approximately 26% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 30% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 18% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $486.0 million at December 31, 2005, approximately $119 million was located outside the United States (with $84 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $94.5 million, approximately $18 million was located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2005. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $707.9 million, $526.2 million and $467.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. 30 In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $59.2 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock based compensation and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Companys separation from Old D&B, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash used in investing activities was $150.4 million, $31.3 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for property and equipment, internal use software and for development costs for MKMVs software products totaled $31.3 million, $21.3 million and $17.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net investments in marketable securities totaled $88.9 million, $6.5 million and $(1.4) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 spending on investments in affiliates included approximately $25 million related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and the $3.9 million contingent payment made in the second quarter related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Companys ownership of Argentine rating agencies. Net cash used in financing activities was $666.5 million, $162.3 million and $227.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $691.7 million in 2005, $221.3 million in 2004 and $171.7 million in 2003. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $89.1 million in 2005, $105.0 million in 2004 and $79.0 million in 2003. Dividends paid were $60.3 million, $44.7 million and $26.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus $0.0375 per share in 2004 and $0.0225 per share in 2003. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2006. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends, of which the Board of Directors declared a quarterly amount of $0.07 per share on December 13, 2005 payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow after dividends to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Systematic share repurchases may constitute the majority of the 31 Companys potential repurchase activity. Moodys will also be prepared to act opportunistically when conditions warrant. On October 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the prepaid principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2005, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2005. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with 32 such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 449.4 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 374.7 Operating lease obligations 63.9 16.7 24.0 12.5 10.7 Purchase obligations (2) 6.5 4.3 2.2 Total $ 519.8 $ 35.9 $ 56.1 $ 42.4 $ 385.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2005 and $145.7 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for data processing services, data back up facilities and professional services. 2006 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects revenue growth in the high single digit to double digit percent range for the full year 2006, including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation. Moodys expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stock based compensation to decline by up to 150 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. This reflects investments the Company is continuing to make to expand internationally, improve analytical processes, pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure. For 2006, Moodys projects year over year growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share in the high single digit to double digit percent range. This expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005, and the expensing of stock based compensation in both 2005 and 2006. 2006 represents the final 33 year of phasing for stock based compensation, which began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.12 $0.14 per diluted share in 2006, compared to $0.10 per diluted share in 2005. In the U.S., the Company is forecasting mid single digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business unit for the full year 2006. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of 2005. The Company is projecting a high teens percent decline from 2005 to 2006 in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities, including home equity securitization, and notes a divergence in market views about the 2006 outlook for this business. Offsetting this expected decline, Moodys looks for double digit year over year growth in asset backed securities, credit derivatives, and commercial mortgage backed securities. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance, gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market, and incremental revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector. Overall, Moodys expects revenue in the U.S. corporate finance business to grow in the low double digit percent range for the year. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in 2006 compared with 2005 and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down. However, fee increases partly related to the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, as well as expected new ratings mandates, should produce revenue growth for the year in the low double digit percent range. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in 2006 than 2005. The Company forecasts revenue for 2006 declining in the mid single digit percent range from the prior year. Moodys forecasts strong growth in the U.S. research business unit at about twenty percent. Outside the U.S., the Company expects ratings revenue to grow in the low teens percent range with high single digit to mid teens percent growth in all major business lines. This forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year. In addition, the outlook assumes low and mid teens percentage growth in corporate revenue in Europe and Asia, respectively. For the financial institutions business Moodys expects to see high single digit revenue growth in Europe, after a year of very strong issuance in 2005, and low double digit percent growth in Asia. The Company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software, and professional services. This should result in mid to high single digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. 34 Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. Information Resources, Inc. An antitrust lawsuit was filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). A detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the SEC. As previously disclosed, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation, AC Nielsen (US), Inc., and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR) (collectively, the VNU Parties), had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the July 30, 2004 Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moodys did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties defaulted on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moodys in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would have required the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. On February 16, 2006, the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties. Such releases will also include the Company, although not a defendant in the litigation, as a releasee. Any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the VNU Parties, and the Company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment. The dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New D&B and or Moodys pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as Utilization of Capital Losses. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow 35 certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the Royalty Report). In the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received a similar Examination Report (the Second Royalty Report) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the Reallocation Report). New D&B also received a similar Examination Report (the Second Reallocation Report) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New D&B and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1995 and 1996. The IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. The settlement was withdrawn by the IRS in November 2004. As a result of these events, the Company increased its reserves for this matter by $30 million in 2004. In 2005, New D&B, Moodys, IMS Health and NMR executed a closing agreement with the IRS reflecting terms originally agreed to in June 2004. After executing the closing agreement, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement. As a result, New D&B and Moodys each increased its share of the assessment by $7.3 million to $35.5 million and Moodys paid approximately $34 million of this amount in October of 2005. These events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of $11.5 million. New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the incremental amounts New D&B and Moodys were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions which New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B should prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of the closing agreement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRS denial of certain tax refunds owing Old D&B for 1993 and 1994. Moodys estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter could be up to $16 million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement, which takes into consideration: (1) the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and (2) the potential write off of receivables (for which the Companys exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar 36 Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years, described below, in which case New D&B has the aforementioned three courses of action. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys current potential exposure could be up to $101 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this Amortization Expense Deductions section. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below. Similar Examination Reports could result for years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&Bs payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to $135 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New D&B has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. On May 6, 2005, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (Notice) from the IRS for the 1999 2002 tax years which (1) disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and to New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns and (2) disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns. On August 4, 2005, New D&B received an Examination Report (the August Examination Report) from the IRS disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns consistent with the Notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty. New D&B has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the August Examination Report. Currently, the Company does not expect that the Notice or the Examination Report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters. Moodys believes that the IRS proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. 37 Utilization of Capital Losses In July 2004, New D&B and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005, and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment. Moodys paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of $12.8 million ($8.1 million net of expected tax benefits) and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately $9 million. Moodys remaining liability at December 31, 2005 was approximately $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If New D&B fails to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, Moodys understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its reserves by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an $8.8 million net reversal of reserves of which $2.7 million related to an increase for the Utilization of Capital Losses matter and $11.5 million related to the reversal for the Royalty Expense Deductions described above. The Company has recorded $5.8 million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves. Moodys total net legacy tax reserves were $97 million (consisting of $106 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $9 million of tax receivables). The $97 million of expected cash payments consists of $8 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $89 million of non current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moodys does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $252 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 and $0.0225 per share, respectively, of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15 and $0.09, respectively. On December 13, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 38 Common Stock Information The Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MCO.
