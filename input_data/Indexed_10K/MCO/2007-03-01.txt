(2) As of the last day of each of the months. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Moodys repurchased 2.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $149.6 million and issued 1.1 million shares of stock under employee stock based compensation plans. Since becoming a public company in October 2000 and through December 31, 2006, Moodys has repurchased 84.4 million shares at a total cost of $2.9 billion, including 38.6 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock based compensation plans. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the total cumulative shareholder return of the Company to the performance of Standard & Poors Stock 500 Index (the S&P 500) and an index of performance peer group companies (the Performance Peer Group). The Company does not believe there are any publicly traded companies that represent strict peers. However, each of the companies in the Performance Peer Group offers business information products in one or more segments of its business. The Performance Peer Group consists of Dow Jones & Company, Inc., The McGraw Hill Companies, Pearson PLC, Reuters Group PLC, Thomson Corporation and Wolters Kluwer nv. The comparison assumes that $100.00 was invested in the Companys common stock (the Common Stock) and in each of the foregoing indices on December 31, 2001. The comparison also assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any. The total return for the Common Stock was 254% during the performance period as compared with a total return during the same period of 35% for the S&P 500 and 27% for the Performance Peer Group.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 31 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 10 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services, and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit information, research and economic commentary, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $47 million, $36 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. 15 Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the monitoring periods range from five to 46 years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $62 million, $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $34 million, $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, commencing on page 28 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $2.4 million, $8.8 million and charges of $30 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 16 Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moodys pension and other post retirement benefit plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2006 which have not been recognized in annual expense are $ 41.0 million and Moodys expects to recognize $2.2 million of actuarial losses in 2007 annual net periodic benefit expense. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $7.8 million, of which $3.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in 2008 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2007 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2007 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2007 Estimated Impact on 2007 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.90% / 5.80% $ (5.3 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.8 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.1 ) * Discount rates of 5.90% and 5.80% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2007 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately 17 $14.4 million in 2007 compared with $14.9 million in 2006. The expected expense decrease in 2007 reflects the effects of higher discount rates, higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses, which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, under the modified prospective application method, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Previously, on January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2006 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2006 Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 2002 2006 grants 0.41% 0.52% 0.10% $ 0.6 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 2002 2006 grants 23% 30% 5% $ (4.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 2002 2006 grants 4.5 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.2 ) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of (i) credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and (ii) research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit information, and research, principally produced by the rating groups, and economic commentary. For presentation purposes, Europe represents Europe, the Middle East and Africa and public finance represents U.S. public finance. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, 18 stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Company Results Moodys revenue in 2006 was $2,037.1 million, an increase of $305.5 million or 17.6% from $1,731.6 million for the same period of 2005. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth above the rate of the overall corporation in global structured finance, corporate finance and research, and below the corporate rate in financial institutions and MKMV, with a decline in revenue from public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,277.8 million in 2006, an increase of $192.4 million or 17.7% from $1,085.4 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and corporate finance, reflecting strong issuance across most structured asset classes as well as corporate bonds and bank loans. Research, financial institutions and MKMV contributed to year over year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $759.3 million in 2006, an increase of $113.1 million or 17.5% from $646.2 million in 2005. International ratings revenue grew approximately $91 million versus the prior year, with about 84% of the growth in Europe where credit derivatives, corporate finance, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors were primary drivers of growth. European research and MKMV contributed to growth as well. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $898.7 million in 2006 were $141.9 million or 18.8% more than $756.8 million in 2005. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately $103 million in growth from prior year. Moodys average global staffing of more than 3,100 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 15% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2006 compared with year end 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,843 1,106 2,949 1,600 919 2,519 Moodys KMV 304 97 401 303 74 377 Total 2,147 1,203 3,350 1,903 993 2,896 Operating expenses were $539.4 million in 2006, an increase of $86.5 million or 19.1% from $452.9 million in 2005. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $76 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $16.3 million year over year due, in part, to the final year of phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period and the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2006 equity grants versus 2005, offset by additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Expenses for 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $359.3 million in 2006, an increase of $55.4 million or 18.2% from $303.9 million in 2005. Year over year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $27 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in technology support and finance functions and $6.0 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional 2006 expenses included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $12 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. 19 Operating income of $1,259.5 million in 2006, which included a 160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006, rose $319.9 million or 34.0% from $939.6 million in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, operating income increased 17%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year over year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys operating margin for 2006 was 61.8% compared to 54.3% in 2005. The gain on the sale of the building increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Moodys reported $1.0 million of interest and other non operating income (expense), net in 2006 compared with ($4.9) million in 2005. Interest expense was $15.2 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005. The amounts included $14.9 million and $20.9 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income was $18.2 million in 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The decrease was attributed to the liquidation of investment portfolios to finance share repurchases. Foreign exchange losses were immaterial in 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005. The year over year change was primarily due to the British pound and euro appreciating to the U.S. dollar. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates were reduced by benefits of $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters below for further information. Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3 million related to additional foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2006 rate was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the settlement of state tax audits. Net income was $753.9 million in 2006, an increase of $193.1 million or 34.4% from $560.8 million in 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, for 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, 2006 net income was $659.8 million, an increase of $99.0 million or 17.7%. Additionally, the gain contributed $0.33 and $0.32 relating to full year basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service in 2006 was $1,894.3 million, up $294.0 million or 18.4% from $1,600.3 million in 2005. Ratings revenue accounted for $250.6 million of growth with increased revenue in global structured finance, corporate finance and financial institutions and sovereign risk offsetting a decline in public finance. Double digit growth in research also contributed to the increase in revenue. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in revenue. Structured finance revenue was $886.7 million in 2006, an increase of $171.3 million or 23.9% from $715.4 million in the same period of 2005. Approximately $109 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the collateralized debt and commercial mortgage backed sectors contributing about 96% of the U.S. increase. Year over year issuance of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations grew, in part, to the increased repackaging of securitized assets such as consumer asset backed and mortgage backed securities, as well as bank loans in collateralized debt obligations. Strong growth in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation issuance was a key driver of overall commercial mortgage backed issuance. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $62 million year over year, with Europe contributing about $58 million, where credit derivatives, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors totaled 92% of the European growth. Foreign currency translation for structured finance positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $2 million. Corporate finance revenue was $396.2 million in 2006, up $73.0 million or 22.6% from $323.2 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 22% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. Investment grade bond issuance increased approximately 17% and high yield bond issuance increased approximately 43%, primarily due to significant mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and second lien loan activity. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $28 million or about 24% due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $266.8 million in 2006, an increase of $12.2 million or 4.8% from $254.6 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in insurance and real estate sectors. Internationally, revenue increased $1.5 million compared to the prior year period. Public finance revenue was $85.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $5.9 million or 6.4% from $91.8 million in 2005. Dollar volume issuance in the municipal bond market declined compared to 2005, primarily due to lower refinancing activity. 20 Research revenue of $258.7 million in 2006 was $43.4 million or 20.2% higher than $215.3 million in 2005. Revenue grew by approximately $28 million in the U.S. and about $15 million internationally, with Europe accounting for approximately 41% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $17 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on the corporate finance, financial institutions and the structured finance related businesses. Revenue from the licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $57 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $8 million, or about 17% higher than the prior year. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $789.1 million in 2006, an increase of $143.7 million or 22.3% from $645.4 million in 2005. The largest contributor to 2006 expenses was growth in compensation and benefits of approximately $110 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses and higher stock based compensation expense of $21.4 million. Furthermore, expenses in 2006 included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $11 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Additional increases were due to increased information technology investment spending of approximately $8 million offset by a decrease of approximately $6 million in legal fees. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, expenses in 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $1,242.9 million in 2006 was up $306.6 million or 32.7% from $936.3 million in 2005, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain, operating income increased 15.6%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year to year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys KMV MKMV revenue of $142.8 million in 2006 was $11.5 million or 8.8% more than the same period in 2005. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increased demand for credit decision making software and software related maintenance services, which grew approximately 10% or $2.7 million compared to 2005. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately 5% or $4.9 million compared to prior year and risk services revenue increased approximately $4 million or about 36% compared to prior year. In 2006, international MKMV revenue accounted for 56% of its global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $109.6 million in 2006, a decrease of $1.8 million or 1.6% from $111.4 million in 2005. The 2006 expenses include a total of $3.5 million due to training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, 2006 expenses include a $2.2 million charge recorded in connection with a non income tax matter. The 2005 expenses included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $16.6 million for 2006 compared with $3.3 million in 2005. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. 21 Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys average global staffing of approximately 2,700 employees during the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately 12% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,600 919 2,519 1,358 761 2,119 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,903 993 2,896 1,687 829 2,516 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million, or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. 22 Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,600.3 million, up $282.8 million or 21.5% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $241.2 million of growth with approximately 80% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $323.2 million for 2005, up $23.6 million or 7.9% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part, related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, which also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance in 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. 23 Moodys Investors Service operating income of $936.3 million in 2005 was up $154.1 million or 19.7% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $131.3 million for 2005 was $10.5 million or 8.7% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $3.3 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 21 countries outside the United States. Approximately 29% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 36% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 30% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $408.1 million at December 31, 2006, approximately $232 million was located outside the United States (with $121 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $75.4 million, approximately $14 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In 2006, the Company entered into two insignificant hedging transactions using purchased put options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks from forecasted billings denominated in euros. Under the Companys current foreign exchange hedging program, the Company hedges currency risk exclusively for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact revenue. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into future hedging transactions and the Company does not have any material derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $752.5 million, $707.9 million and $526.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased by $44.6 million compared with 2005. Growth in net income contributed $193.1 million to cash provided by operating activities. The 2006 cash flows include a decrease 24 relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans of $103.2 million that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities as required under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation was presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow, along with other tax cash flows. The operating cash flow includes a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Companys headquarters building. The cash proceeds are reported as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in accounts receivable is attributable to increases in revenue offset by improved collection. Additionally, Moodys deposited approximately $40 million with the IRS in the first quarter of 2006 relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. This deposit was recorded in other assets. Tax payments increased by $53 million in 2006 versus 2005 offset by increases in income taxes payable due to growth in pre tax net income. An increase in deferred revenue increased cash flow from operations by $28 million which is due to increased volume in annual and initial fees in both the ratings and research businesses. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $116.1 million, ($150.4) million and ($31.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures, primarily for property and equipment and internal use software, totaled $31.1 million, $31.3 million and $21.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net maturities (investments) in marketable securities totaled $22.5 million, ($88.9) million and ($6.5) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 spending on acquisitions was $39.2 million, which related primarily to the purchase of a 49% share in China Cheng Xin International Credit Rating Co. Ltd and the acquisition of Wall Street Analytics, Inc., net of cash acquired. The 2005 spending on acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and a contingent payment made in the second quarter of 2005 related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount primarily related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The net proceeds received from the sale of the Companys headquarters building at 99 Church Street, New York, New York in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $965.2 million, $666.5 million and $162.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $1,093.6 million in 2006, $691.7 million in 2005 and $221.3 million in 2004. Dividends paid were $79.5 million, $60.3 million and $44.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.07 per share in 2006, $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share in 2004. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.3 million in 2006, $89.1 million in 2005 and $105.0 million in 2004. The 2006 amount also includes $103.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities under SFAS No. 123R Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2007. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Moodys may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During 25 August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the Lease) commencing on October 20, 2006 with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new headquarters. The Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. The Company will incur approximately $110 million of costs in 2007 to fit out the new headquarters. The costs will be paid for using the proceeds from the sale of the Companys current corporate headquarters building. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the Prepaid Principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the Prepaid Principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2006, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2006. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. In October 2006, Moodys amended its Facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a sale leaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building at 99 Church Street from $150 million to $250 million. Additionally, the 26 restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the sale of 99 Church Street was also increased from $150 million to $250 million. The Company also increased the expansion feature of the credit facility from $80 million to $340 million, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders. This increase gives the Company potential borrowing capacity under the Facility of $500 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 430.7 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 356.0 Capital lease obligations 1.0 0.5 0.5 Operating lease obligations (2) 639.5 34.5 80.4 62.2 462.4 Purchase obligations (3) 30.4 23.6 6.7 0.1 Total (4) $ 1,101.6 $ 73.5 $ 117.5 $ 92.2 $ 818.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2006 and $127.0 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Includes the new operating lease agreement, which commenced on October 20, 2006, between the Company and 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new corporate headquarters in mid to late 2007. See Future Cash Requirements for further information. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for professional services, data processing services, telecommunication services and data back up facilities. (4) In early 2007, the Company entered into contractual obligations of approximately $110 million related to the buildout of its new corporate headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. These amounts are not included in the table above. 2007 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2007 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2007. This growth assumes foreign currency translation in 2007 at current exchange rates, which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation. Excluding the gain on sale of the 99 Church Street building, Moodys expects the operating margin to decline by approximately 150 basis points in 2007, due to investments the Company is continuing to make to sustain business growth, including international expansion, improving analytical processes, pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introducing new products, improving technology infrastructure and relocating Moodys headquarters in New York City. Diluted earnings per share in 2007 are projected to be modestly lower compared to 2006 as a result of the after tax gain of $94.1 million on the sale of the 99 Church Street headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the U.S., the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business for the full year 2007. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise 27 in the high single to double digit percent range, including strong double digit year over year percent growth in revenue from credit derivatives and commercial mortgage backed securities ratings, partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities ratings, including home equity securitization. In the U.S. corporate finance business, Moodys expects revenue growth in the low double digit percent range for the year, including good growth from rated bonds, bank loans and new products. The Company anticipates a stronger first half of 2007 followed by a weaker second half in this sector, due in part to an expected moderation in the pace of leveraged buyout transactions. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects revenue in 2007 to grow in the low teens percent range for the year. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys expects revenue for 2007 to grow modestly. The Company forecasts growth in the U.S. research business to be about 20%. Outside the U.S., Moodys expects ratings revenue to grow in the high teens percent range with mid to high teens percent growth in all major business lines, led by corporate finance revenue growth in Europe and Asia, financial institutions growth in Europe and growth in international structured finance. The Company also projects about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects growth in sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software and professional services. This should result in low double digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on recognition and derecognition of tax benefits resulting from a subsequent change of judgment, classification of liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. In accordance with FIN No. 48, a company is required to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority, without considering time values. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and accordingly, is required to be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company expects a reduction of retained earnings of between $40 million and $45 million with no impact to the statement of operations and cash flows. This is based on a preliminary assessment and could change based on final analysis which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. After the initial adoption of FIN No. 48, the financial impacts to the statement of operations and cash flows is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of legacy tax matters and other tax matters with the taxing authorities. The Company is unable to predict the final resolution of these matters. See Note 16, Contingencies for further discussion of legacy tax matters. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value whereby fair value is based on an exit price that would result from market participants behavior, as well as sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value. SFAS No. 157 imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements and is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impacts that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits 28 in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. The principal Legacy Contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters. To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, Old D&B through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions This matter related to the IRSs stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 as well as the IRSs intention to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for 1996. These matters were settled with the IRS in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of 2005 and accordingly, the Company reduced its reserve for this matter by $11.5 million. However, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the liability. New D&B may commence arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the $7.3 million that New D&B and Moodys each were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions that New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B will prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. 29 In the second quarter of 2006, Moodys paid approximately $9 million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the October 2005 settlement with the IRS and reversed the remaining reserve of $1.5 million. Additionally, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRSs denial of the tax refunds. In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS Appeals Office rejected New D&Bs protest. New D&B is determining whether to file suit for the refund. Moodys share is estimated at approximately $9 million. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. The IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with these positions taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys potential exposures (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits) could be up to $120 million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately $6 million to $10 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns. Additionally, there are potential exposures that could be up to $164 million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to Old D&B. Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B is currently in discussion with the IRS on these issues. On March 3, 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005. The third and final assessment was received in April 2006 of which Moodys paid $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys for the first two assessments included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. New D&B was unable to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its liabilities by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Legacy Tax Related Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 30 For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $2.4 million and $8.8 million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by $30.0 million, respectively. The Company also has recorded $3.5 million, $5.8 million and $3.4 million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Moodys total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of December 31, 2006 were $93 million and are classified as long term. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2006, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in each of the quarters of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.28 during the year. During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 per share of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.

MOODYS PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May yet be Purchased Under the Program (2) October 1 31 971,702 (1) $ 63.44 971,479 $ 1,850.3 million November 1 30 722,982 (1) 67.23 722,016 1,801.8 million December 1 31 562,500 69.99 562,500 1,762.4 million Total 2,257,184 2,255,995 (1) Includes the surrender to the Company of 223 and 966 shares in October and November, respectively, of common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. (2) As of the last day of each of the months. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Moodys repurchased 2.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $149.6 million and issued 1.1 million shares of stock under employee stock based compensation plans. Since becoming a public company in October 2000 and through December 31, 2006, Moodys has repurchased 84.4 million shares at a total cost of $2.9 billion, including 38.6 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock based compensation plans. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the total cumulative shareholder return of the Company to the performance of Standard & Poors Stock 500 Index (the S&P 500) and an index of performance peer group companies (the Performance Peer Group). The Company does not believe there are any publicly traded companies that represent strict peers. However, each of the companies in the Performance Peer Group offers business information products in one or more segments of its business. The Performance Peer Group consists of Dow Jones & Company, Inc., The McGraw Hill Companies, Pearson PLC, Reuters Group PLC, Thomson Corporation and Wolters Kluwer nv. The comparison assumes that $100.00 was invested in the Companys common stock (the Common Stock) and in each of the foregoing indices on December 31, 2001. The comparison also assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any. The total return for the Common Stock was 254% during the performance period as compared with a total return during the same period of 35% for the S&P 500 and 27% for the Performance Peer Group.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 31 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 10 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services, and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit information, research and economic commentary, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $47 million, $36 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. 15 Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the monitoring periods range from five to 46 years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $62 million, $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $34 million, $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, commencing on page 28 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $2.4 million, $8.8 million and charges of $30 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 16 Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moodys pension and other post retirement benefit plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2006 which have not been recognized in annual expense are $ 41.0 million and Moodys expects to recognize $2.2 million of actuarial losses in 2007 annual net periodic benefit expense. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $7.8 million, of which $3.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in 2008 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2007 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2007 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2007 Estimated Impact on 2007 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.90% / 5.80% $ (5.3 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.8 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.1 ) * Discount rates of 5.90% and 5.80% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2007 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately 17 $14.4 million in 2007 compared with $14.9 million in 2006. The expected expense decrease in 2007 reflects the effects of higher discount rates, higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses, which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, under the modified prospective application method, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Previously, on January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2006 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2006 Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 2002 2006 grants 0.41% 0.52% 0.10% $ 0.6 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 2002 2006 grants 23% 30% 5% $ (4.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 2002 2006 grants 4.5 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.2 ) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of (i) credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and (ii) research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit information, and research, principally produced by the rating groups, and economic commentary. For presentation purposes, Europe represents Europe, the Middle East and Africa and public finance represents U.S. public finance. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, 18 stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Company Results Moodys revenue in 2006 was $2,037.1 million, an increase of $305.5 million or 17.6% from $1,731.6 million for the same period of 2005. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth above the rate of the overall corporation in global structured finance, corporate finance and research, and below the corporate rate in financial institutions and MKMV, with a decline in revenue from public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,277.8 million in 2006, an increase of $192.4 million or 17.7% from $1,085.4 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and corporate finance, reflecting strong issuance across most structured asset classes as well as corporate bonds and bank loans. Research, financial institutions and MKMV contributed to year over year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $759.3 million in 2006, an increase of $113.1 million or 17.5% from $646.2 million in 2005. International ratings revenue grew approximately $91 million versus the prior year, with about 84% of the growth in Europe where credit derivatives, corporate finance, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors were primary drivers of growth. European research and MKMV contributed to growth as well. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $898.7 million in 2006 were $141.9 million or 18.8% more than $756.8 million in 2005. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately $103 million in growth from prior year. Moodys average global staffing of more than 3,100 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 15% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2006 compared with year end 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,843 1,106 2,949 1,600 919 2,519 Moodys KMV 304 97 401 303 74 377 Total 2,147 1,203 3,350 1,903 993 2,896 Operating expenses were $539.4 million in 2006, an increase of $86.5 million or 19.1% from $452.9 million in 2005. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $76 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $16.3 million year over year due, in part, to the final year of phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period and the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2006 equity grants versus 2005, offset by additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Expenses for 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $359.3 million in 2006, an increase of $55.4 million or 18.2% from $303.9 million in 2005. Year over year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $27 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in technology support and finance functions and $6.0 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional 2006 expenses included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $12 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. 19 Operating income of $1,259.5 million in 2006, which included a 160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006, rose $319.9 million or 34.0% from $939.6 million in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, operating income increased 17%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year over year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys operating margin for 2006 was 61.8% compared to 54.3% in 2005. The gain on the sale of the building increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Moodys reported $1.0 million of interest and other non operating income (expense), net in 2006 compared with ($4.9) million in 2005. Interest expense was $15.2 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005. The amounts included $14.9 million and $20.9 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income was $18.2 million in 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The decrease was attributed to the liquidation of investment portfolios to finance share repurchases. Foreign exchange losses were immaterial in 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005. The year over year change was primarily due to the British pound and euro appreciating to the U.S. dollar. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates were reduced by benefits of $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters below for further information. Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3 million related to additional foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2006 rate was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the settlement of state tax audits. Net income was $753.9 million in 2006, an increase of $193.1 million or 34.4% from $560.8 million in 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, for 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, 2006 net income was $659.8 million, an increase of $99.0 million or 17.7%. Additionally, the gain contributed $0.33 and $0.32 relating to full year basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service in 2006 was $1,894.3 million, up $294.0 million or 18.4% from $1,600.3 million in 2005. Ratings revenue accounted for $250.6 million of growth with increased revenue in global structured finance, corporate finance and financial institutions and sovereign risk offsetting a decline in public finance. Double digit growth in research also contributed to the increase in revenue. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in revenue. Structured finance revenue was $886.7 million in 2006, an increase of $171.3 million or 23.9% from $715.4 million in the same period of 2005. Approximately $109 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the collateralized debt and commercial mortgage backed sectors contributing about 96% of the U.S. increase. Year over year issuance of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations grew, in part, to the increased repackaging of securitized assets such as consumer asset backed and mortgage backed securities, as well as bank loans in collateralized debt obligations. Strong growth in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation issuance was a key driver of overall commercial mortgage backed issuance. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $62 million year over year, with Europe contributing about $58 million, where credit derivatives, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors totaled 92% of the European growth. Foreign currency translation for structured finance positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $2 million. Corporate finance revenue was $396.2 million in 2006, up $73.0 million or 22.6% from $323.2 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 22% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. Investment grade bond issuance increased approximately 17% and high yield bond issuance increased approximately 43%, primarily due to significant mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and second lien loan activity. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $28 million or about 24% due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $266.8 million in 2006, an increase of $12.2 million or 4.8% from $254.6 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in insurance and real estate sectors. Internationally, revenue increased $1.5 million compared to the prior year period. Public finance revenue was $85.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $5.9 million or 6.4% from $91.8 million in 2005. Dollar volume issuance in the municipal bond market declined compared to 2005, primarily due to lower refinancing activity. 20 Research revenue of $258.7 million in 2006 was $43.4 million or 20.2% higher than $215.3 million in 2005. Revenue grew by approximately $28 million in the U.S. and about $15 million internationally, with Europe accounting for approximately 41% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $17 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on the corporate finance, financial institutions and the structured finance related businesses. Revenue from the licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $57 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $8 million, or about 17% higher than the prior year. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $789.1 million in 2006, an increase of $143.7 million or 22.3% from $645.4 million in 2005. The largest contributor to 2006 expenses was growth in compensation and benefits of approximately $110 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses and higher stock based compensation expense of $21.4 million. Furthermore, expenses in 2006 included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $11 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Additional increases were due to increased information technology investment spending of approximately $8 million offset by a decrease of approximately $6 million in legal fees. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, expenses in 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $1,242.9 million in 2006 was up $306.6 million or 32.7% from $936.3 million in 2005, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain, operating income increased 15.6%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year to year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys KMV MKMV revenue of $142.8 million in 2006 was $11.5 million or 8.8% more than the same period in 2005. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increased demand for credit decision making software and software related maintenance services, which grew approximately 10% or $2.7 million compared to 2005. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately 5% or $4.9 million compared to prior year and risk services revenue increased approximately $4 million or about 36% compared to prior year. In 2006, international MKMV revenue accounted for 56% of its global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $109.6 million in 2006, a decrease of $1.8 million or 1.6% from $111.4 million in 2005. The 2006 expenses include a total of $3.5 million due to training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, 2006 expenses include a $2.2 million charge recorded in connection with a non income tax matter. The 2005 expenses included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $16.6 million for 2006 compared with $3.3 million in 2005. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. 21 Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys average global staffing of approximately 2,700 employees during the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately 12% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,600 919 2,519 1,358 761 2,119 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,903 993 2,896 1,687 829 2,516 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million, or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. 22 Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,600.3 million, up $282.8 million or 21.5% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $241.2 million of growth with approximately 80% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $323.2 million for 2005, up $23.6 million or 7.9% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part, related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, which also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance in 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. 23 Moodys Investors Service operating income of $936.3 million in 2005 was up $154.1 million or 19.7% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $131.3 million for 2005 was $10.5 million or 8.7% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $3.3 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 21 countries outside the United States. Approximately 29% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 36% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 30% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $408.1 million at December 31, 2006, approximately $232 million was located outside the United States (with $121 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $75.4 million, approximately $14 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In 2006, the Company entered into two insignificant hedging transactions using purchased put options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks from forecasted billings denominated in euros. Under the Companys current foreign exchange hedging program, the Company hedges currency risk exclusively for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact revenue. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into future hedging transactions and the Company does not have any material derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $752.5 million, $707.9 million and $526.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased by $44.6 million compared with 2005. Growth in net income contributed $193.1 million to cash provided by operating activities. The 2006 cash flows include a decrease 24 relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans of $103.2 million that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities as required under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation was presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow, along with other tax cash flows. The operating cash flow includes a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Companys headquarters building. The cash proceeds are reported as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in accounts receivable is attributable to increases in revenue offset by improved collection. Additionally, Moodys deposited approximately $40 million with the IRS in the first quarter of 2006 relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. This deposit was recorded in other assets. Tax payments increased by $53 million in 2006 versus 2005 offset by increases in income taxes payable due to growth in pre tax net income. An increase in deferred revenue increased cash flow from operations by $28 million which is due to increased volume in annual and initial fees in both the ratings and research businesses. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $116.1 million, ($150.4) million and ($31.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures, primarily for property and equipment and internal use software, totaled $31.1 million, $31.3 million and $21.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net maturities (investments) in marketable securities totaled $22.5 million, ($88.9) million and ($6.5) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 spending on acquisitions was $39.2 million, which related primarily to the purchase of a 49% share in China Cheng Xin International Credit Rating Co. Ltd and the acquisition of Wall Street Analytics, Inc., net of cash acquired. The 2005 spending on acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and a contingent payment made in the second quarter of 2005 related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount primarily related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The net proceeds received from the sale of the Companys headquarters building at 99 Church Street, New York, New York in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $965.2 million, $666.5 million and $162.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $1,093.6 million in 2006, $691.7 million in 2005 and $221.3 million in 2004. Dividends paid were $79.5 million, $60.3 million and $44.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.07 per share in 2006, $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share in 2004. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.3 million in 2006, $89.1 million in 2005 and $105.0 million in 2004. The 2006 amount also includes $103.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities under SFAS No. 123R Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2007. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Moodys may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During 25 August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the Lease) commencing on October 20, 2006 with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new headquarters. The Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. The Company will incur approximately $110 million of costs in 2007 to fit out the new headquarters. The costs will be paid for using the proceeds from the sale of the Companys current corporate headquarters building. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the Prepaid Principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the Prepaid Principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2006, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2006. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. In October 2006, Moodys amended its Facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a sale leaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building at 99 Church Street from $150 million to $250 million. Additionally, the 26 restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the sale of 99 Church Street was also increased from $150 million to $250 million. The Company also increased the expansion feature of the credit facility from $80 million to $340 million, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders. This increase gives the Company potential borrowing capacity under the Facility of $500 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 430.7 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 356.0 Capital lease obligations 1.0 0.5 0.5 Operating lease obligations (2) 639.5 34.5 80.4 62.2 462.4 Purchase obligations (3) 30.4 23.6 6.7 0.1 Total (4) $ 1,101.6 $ 73.5 $ 117.5 $ 92.2 $ 818.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2006 and $127.0 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Includes the new operating lease agreement, which commenced on October 20, 2006, between the Company and 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new corporate headquarters in mid to late 2007. See Future Cash Requirements for further information. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for professional services, data processing services, telecommunication services and data back up facilities. (4) In early 2007, the Company entered into contractual obligations of approximately $110 million related to the buildout of its new corporate headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. These amounts are not included in the table above. 2007 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2007 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2007. This growth assumes foreign currency translation in 2007 at current exchange rates, which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation. Excluding the gain on sale of the 99 Church Street building, Moodys expects the operating margin to decline by approximately 150 basis points in 2007, due to investments the Company is continuing to make to sustain business growth, including international expansion, improving analytical processes, pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introducing new products, improving technology infrastructure and relocating Moodys headquarters in New York City. Diluted earnings per share in 2007 are projected to be modestly lower compared to 2006 as a result of the after tax gain of $94.1 million on the sale of the 99 Church Street headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the U.S., the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business for the full year 2007. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise 27 in the high single to double digit percent range, including strong double digit year over year percent growth in revenue from credit derivatives and commercial mortgage backed securities ratings, partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities ratings, including home equity securitization. In the U.S. corporate finance business, Moodys expects revenue growth in the low double digit percent range for the year, including good growth from rated bonds, bank loans and new products. The Company anticipates a stronger first half of 2007 followed by a weaker second half in this sector, due in part to an expected moderation in the pace of leveraged buyout transactions. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects revenue in 2007 to grow in the low teens percent range for the year. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys expects revenue for 2007 to grow modestly. The Company forecasts growth in the U.S. research business to be about 20%. Outside the U.S., Moodys expects ratings revenue to grow in the high teens percent range with mid to high teens percent growth in all major business lines, led by corporate finance revenue growth in Europe and Asia, financial institutions growth in Europe and growth in international structured finance. The Company also projects about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects growth in sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software and professional services. This should result in low double digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on recognition and derecognition of tax benefits resulting from a subsequent change of judgment, classification of liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. In accordance with FIN No. 48, a company is required to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority, without considering time values. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and accordingly, is required to be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company expects a reduction of retained earnings of between $40 million and $45 million with no impact to the statement of operations and cash flows. This is based on a preliminary assessment and could change based on final analysis which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. After the initial adoption of FIN No. 48, the financial impacts to the statement of operations and cash flows is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of legacy tax matters and other tax matters with the taxing authorities. The Company is unable to predict the final resolution of these matters. See Note 16, Contingencies for further discussion of legacy tax matters. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value whereby fair value is based on an exit price that would result from market participants behavior, as well as sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value. SFAS No. 157 imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements and is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impacts that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits 28 in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. The principal Legacy Contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters. To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, Old D&B through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions This matter related to the IRSs stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 as well as the IRSs intention to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for 1996. These matters were settled with the IRS in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of 2005 and accordingly, the Company reduced its reserve for this matter by $11.5 million. However, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the liability. New D&B may commence arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the $7.3 million that New D&B and Moodys each were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions that New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B will prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. 29 In the second quarter of 2006, Moodys paid approximately $9 million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the October 2005 settlement with the IRS and reversed the remaining reserve of $1.5 million. Additionally, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRSs denial of the tax refunds. In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS Appeals Office rejected New D&Bs protest. New D&B is determining whether to file suit for the refund. Moodys share is estimated at approximately $9 million. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. The IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with these positions taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys potential exposures (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits) could be up to $120 million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately $6 million to $10 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns. Additionally, there are potential exposures that could be up to $164 million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to Old D&B. Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B is currently in discussion with the IRS on these issues. On March 3, 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005. The third and final assessment was received in April 2006 of which Moodys paid $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys for the first two assessments included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. New D&B was unable to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its liabilities by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Legacy Tax Related Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 30 For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $2.4 million and $8.8 million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by $30.0 million, respectively. The Company also has recorded $3.5 million, $5.8 million and $3.4 million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Moodys total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of December 31, 2006 were $93 million and are classified as long term. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2006, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in each of the quarters of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.28 during the year. During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 per share of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 31 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 10 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services, and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit information, research and economic commentary, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $47 million, $36 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. 15 Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the monitoring periods range from five to 46 years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $62 million, $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $34 million, $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, commencing on page 28 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $2.4 million, $8.8 million and charges of $30 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 16 Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moodys pension and other post retirement benefit plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2006 which have not been recognized in annual expense are $ 41.0 million and Moodys expects to recognize $2.2 million of actuarial losses in 2007 annual net periodic benefit expense. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $7.8 million, of which $3.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in 2008 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2007 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2007 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2007 Estimated Impact on 2007 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.90% / 5.80% $ (5.3 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.8 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.1 ) * Discount rates of 5.90% and 5.80% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2007 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately 17 $14.4 million in 2007 compared with $14.9 million in 2006. The expected expense decrease in 2007 reflects the effects of higher discount rates, higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses, which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, under the modified prospective application method, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Previously, on January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2006 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2006 Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 2002 2006 grants 0.41% 0.52% 0.10% $ 0.6 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 2002 2006 grants 23% 30% 5% $ (4.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 2002 2006 grants 4.5 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.2 ) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of (i) credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and (ii) research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit information, and research, principally produced by the rating groups, and economic commentary. For presentation purposes, Europe represents Europe, the Middle East and Africa and public finance represents U.S. public finance. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, 18 stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Company Results Moodys revenue in 2006 was $2,037.1 million, an increase of $305.5 million or 17.6% from $1,731.6 million for the same period of 2005. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth above the rate of the overall corporation in global structured finance, corporate finance and research, and below the corporate rate in financial institutions and MKMV, with a decline in revenue from public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,277.8 million in 2006, an increase of $192.4 million or 17.7% from $1,085.4 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and corporate finance, reflecting strong issuance across most structured asset classes as well as corporate bonds and bank loans. Research, financial institutions and MKMV contributed to year over year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $759.3 million in 2006, an increase of $113.1 million or 17.5% from $646.2 million in 2005. International ratings revenue grew approximately $91 million versus the prior year, with about 84% of the growth in Europe where credit derivatives, corporate finance, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors were primary drivers of growth. European research and MKMV contributed to growth as well. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $898.7 million in 2006 were $141.9 million or 18.8% more than $756.8 million in 2005. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately $103 million in growth from prior year. Moodys average global staffing of more than 3,100 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 15% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2006 compared with year end 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,843 1,106 2,949 1,600 919 2,519 Moodys KMV 304 97 401 303 74 377 Total 2,147 1,203 3,350 1,903 993 2,896 Operating expenses were $539.4 million in 2006, an increase of $86.5 million or 19.1% from $452.9 million in 2005. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $76 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $16.3 million year over year due, in part, to the final year of phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period and the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2006 equity grants versus 2005, offset by additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Expenses for 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $359.3 million in 2006, an increase of $55.4 million or 18.2% from $303.9 million in 2005. Year over year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $27 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in technology support and finance functions and $6.0 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional 2006 expenses included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $12 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. 19 Operating income of $1,259.5 million in 2006, which included a 160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006, rose $319.9 million or 34.0% from $939.6 million in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, operating income increased 17%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year over year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys operating margin for 2006 was 61.8% compared to 54.3% in 2005. The gain on the sale of the building increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Moodys reported $1.0 million of interest and other non operating income (expense), net in 2006 compared with ($4.9) million in 2005. Interest expense was $15.2 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005. The amounts included $14.9 million and $20.9 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income was $18.2 million in 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The decrease was attributed to the liquidation of investment portfolios to finance share repurchases. Foreign exchange losses were immaterial in 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005. The year over year change was primarily due to the British pound and euro appreciating to the U.S. dollar. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates were reduced by benefits of $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters below for further information. Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3 million related to additional foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2006 rate was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the settlement of state tax audits. Net income was $753.9 million in 2006, an increase of $193.1 million or 34.4% from $560.8 million in 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, for 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, 2006 net income was $659.8 million, an increase of $99.0 million or 17.7%. Additionally, the gain contributed $0.33 and $0.32 relating to full year basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service in 2006 was $1,894.3 million, up $294.0 million or 18.4% from $1,600.3 million in 2005. Ratings revenue accounted for $250.6 million of growth with increased revenue in global structured finance, corporate finance and financial institutions and sovereign risk offsetting a decline in public finance. Double digit growth in research also contributed to the increase in revenue. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in revenue. Structured finance revenue was $886.7 million in 2006, an increase of $171.3 million or 23.9% from $715.4 million in the same period of 2005. Approximately $109 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the collateralized debt and commercial mortgage backed sectors contributing about 96% of the U.S. increase. Year over year issuance of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations grew, in part, to the increased repackaging of securitized assets such as consumer asset backed and mortgage backed securities, as well as bank loans in collateralized debt obligations. Strong growth in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation issuance was a key driver of overall commercial mortgage backed issuance. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $62 million year over year, with Europe contributing about $58 million, where credit derivatives, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors totaled 92% of the European growth. Foreign currency translation for structured finance positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $2 million. Corporate finance revenue was $396.2 million in 2006, up $73.0 million or 22.6% from $323.2 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 22% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. Investment grade bond issuance increased approximately 17% and high yield bond issuance increased approximately 43%, primarily due to significant mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and second lien loan activity. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $28 million or about 24% due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $266.8 million in 2006, an increase of $12.2 million or 4.8% from $254.6 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in insurance and real estate sectors. Internationally, revenue increased $1.5 million compared to the prior year period. Public finance revenue was $85.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $5.9 million or 6.4% from $91.8 million in 2005. Dollar volume issuance in the municipal bond market declined compared to 2005, primarily due to lower refinancing activity. 20 Research revenue of $258.7 million in 2006 was $43.4 million or 20.2% higher than $215.3 million in 2005. Revenue grew by approximately $28 million in the U.S. and about $15 million internationally, with Europe accounting for approximately 41% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $17 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on the corporate finance, financial institutions and the structured finance related businesses. Revenue from the licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $57 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $8 million, or about 17% higher than the prior year. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $789.1 million in 2006, an increase of $143.7 million or 22.3% from $645.4 million in 2005. The largest contributor to 2006 expenses was growth in compensation and benefits of approximately $110 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses and higher stock based compensation expense of $21.4 million. Furthermore, expenses in 2006 included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $11 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Additional increases were due to increased information technology investment spending of approximately $8 million offset by a decrease of approximately $6 million in legal fees. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, expenses in 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $1,242.9 million in 2006 was up $306.6 million or 32.7% from $936.3 million in 2005, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain, operating income increased 15.6%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year to year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys KMV MKMV revenue of $142.8 million in 2006 was $11.5 million or 8.8% more than the same period in 2005. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increased demand for credit decision making software and software related maintenance services, which grew approximately 10% or $2.7 million compared to 2005. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately 5% or $4.9 million compared to prior year and risk services revenue increased approximately $4 million or about 36% compared to prior year. In 2006, international MKMV revenue accounted for 56% of its global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $109.6 million in 2006, a decrease of $1.8 million or 1.6% from $111.4 million in 2005. The 2006 expenses include a total of $3.5 million due to training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, 2006 expenses include a $2.2 million charge recorded in connection with a non income tax matter. The 2005 expenses included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $16.6 million for 2006 compared with $3.3 million in 2005. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. 21 Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys average global staffing of approximately 2,700 employees during the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately 12% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,600 919 2,519 1,358 761 2,119 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,903 993 2,896 1,687 829 2,516 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million, or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. 22 Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,600.3 million, up $282.8 million or 21.5% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $241.2 million of growth with approximately 80% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $323.2 million for 2005, up $23.6 million or 7.9% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part, related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, which also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance in 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. 23 Moodys Investors Service operating income of $936.3 million in 2005 was up $154.1 million or 19.7% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $131.3 million for 2005 was $10.5 million or 8.7% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $3.3 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 21 countries outside the United States. Approximately 29% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 36% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 30% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $408.1 million at December 31, 2006, approximately $232 million was located outside the United States (with $121 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $75.4 million, approximately $14 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In 2006, the Company entered into two insignificant hedging transactions using purchased put options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks from forecasted billings denominated in euros. Under the Companys current foreign exchange hedging program, the Company hedges currency risk exclusively for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact revenue. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into future hedging transactions and the Company does not have any material derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $752.5 million, $707.9 million and $526.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased by $44.6 million compared with 2005. Growth in net income contributed $193.1 million to cash provided by operating activities. The 2006 cash flows include a decrease 24 relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans of $103.2 million that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities as required under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation was presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow, along with other tax cash flows. The operating cash flow includes a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Companys headquarters building. The cash proceeds are reported as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in accounts receivable is attributable to increases in revenue offset by improved collection. Additionally, Moodys deposited approximately $40 million with the IRS in the first quarter of 2006 relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. This deposit was recorded in other assets. Tax payments increased by $53 million in 2006 versus 2005 offset by increases in income taxes payable due to growth in pre tax net income. An increase in deferred revenue increased cash flow from operations by $28 million which is due to increased volume in annual and initial fees in both the ratings and research businesses. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $116.1 million, ($150.4) million and ($31.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures, primarily for property and equipment and internal use software, totaled $31.1 million, $31.3 million and $21.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net maturities (investments) in marketable securities totaled $22.5 million, ($88.9) million and ($6.5) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 spending on acquisitions was $39.2 million, which related primarily to the purchase of a 49% share in China Cheng Xin International Credit Rating Co. Ltd and the acquisition of Wall Street Analytics, Inc., net of cash acquired. The 2005 spending on acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and a contingent payment made in the second quarter of 2005 related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount primarily related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The net proceeds received from the sale of the Companys headquarters building at 99 Church Street, New York, New York in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $965.2 million, $666.5 million and $162.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $1,093.6 million in 2006, $691.7 million in 2005 and $221.3 million in 2004. Dividends paid were $79.5 million, $60.3 million and $44.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.07 per share in 2006, $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share in 2004. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.3 million in 2006, $89.1 million in 2005 and $105.0 million in 2004. The 2006 amount also includes $103.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities under SFAS No. 123R Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2007. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Moodys may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During 25 August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the Lease) commencing on October 20, 2006 with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new headquarters. The Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. The Company will incur approximately $110 million of costs in 2007 to fit out the new headquarters. The costs will be paid for using the proceeds from the sale of the Companys current corporate headquarters building. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the Prepaid Principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the Prepaid Principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2006, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2006. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. In October 2006, Moodys amended its Facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a sale leaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building at 99 Church Street from $150 million to $250 million. Additionally, the 26 restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the sale of 99 Church Street was also increased from $150 million to $250 million. The Company also increased the expansion feature of the credit facility from $80 million to $340 million, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders. This increase gives the Company potential borrowing capacity under the Facility of $500 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 430.7 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 356.0 Capital lease obligations 1.0 0.5 0.5 Operating lease obligations (2) 639.5 34.5 80.4 62.2 462.4 Purchase obligations (3) 30.4 23.6 6.7 0.1 Total (4) $ 1,101.6 $ 73.5 $ 117.5 $ 92.2 $ 818.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2006 and $127.0 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Includes the new operating lease agreement, which commenced on October 20, 2006, between the Company and 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new corporate headquarters in mid to late 2007. See Future Cash Requirements for further information. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for professional services, data processing services, telecommunication services and data back up facilities. (4) In early 2007, the Company entered into contractual obligations of approximately $110 million related to the buildout of its new corporate headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. These amounts are not included in the table above. 2007 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2007 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2007. This growth assumes foreign currency translation in 2007 at current exchange rates, which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation. Excluding the gain on sale of the 99 Church Street building, Moodys expects the operating margin to decline by approximately 150 basis points in 2007, due to investments the Company is continuing to make to sustain business growth, including international expansion, improving analytical processes, pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introducing new products, improving technology infrastructure and relocating Moodys headquarters in New York City. Diluted earnings per share in 2007 are projected to be modestly lower compared to 2006 as a result of the after tax gain of $94.1 million on the sale of the 99 Church Street headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the U.S., the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business for the full year 2007. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise 27 in the high single to double digit percent range, including strong double digit year over year percent growth in revenue from credit derivatives and commercial mortgage backed securities ratings, partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities ratings, including home equity securitization. In the U.S. corporate finance business, Moodys expects revenue growth in the low double digit percent range for the year, including good growth from rated bonds, bank loans and new products. The Company anticipates a stronger first half of 2007 followed by a weaker second half in this sector, due in part to an expected moderation in the pace of leveraged buyout transactions. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects revenue in 2007 to grow in the low teens percent range for the year. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys expects revenue for 2007 to grow modestly. The Company forecasts growth in the U.S. research business to be about 20%. Outside the U.S., Moodys expects ratings revenue to grow in the high teens percent range with mid to high teens percent growth in all major business lines, led by corporate finance revenue growth in Europe and Asia, financial institutions growth in Europe and growth in international structured finance. The Company also projects about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects growth in sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software and professional services. This should result in low double digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on recognition and derecognition of tax benefits resulting from a subsequent change of judgment, classification of liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. In accordance with FIN No. 48, a company is required to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority, without considering time values. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and accordingly, is required to be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company expects a reduction of retained earnings of between $40 million and $45 million with no impact to the statement of operations and cash flows. This is based on a preliminary assessment and could change based on final analysis which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. After the initial adoption of FIN No. 48, the financial impacts to the statement of operations and cash flows is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of legacy tax matters and other tax matters with the taxing authorities. The Company is unable to predict the final resolution of these matters. See Note 16, Contingencies for further discussion of legacy tax matters. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value whereby fair value is based on an exit price that would result from market participants behavior, as well as sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value. SFAS No. 157 imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements and is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impacts that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits 28 in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. The principal Legacy Contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters. To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, Old D&B through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions This matter related to the IRSs stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 as well as the IRSs intention to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for 1996. These matters were settled with the IRS in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of 2005 and accordingly, the Company reduced its reserve for this matter by $11.5 million. However, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the liability. New D&B may commence arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the $7.3 million that New D&B and Moodys each were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions that New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B will prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. 29 In the second quarter of 2006, Moodys paid approximately $9 million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the October 2005 settlement with the IRS and reversed the remaining reserve of $1.5 million. Additionally, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRSs denial of the tax refunds. In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS Appeals Office rejected New D&Bs protest. New D&B is determining whether to file suit for the refund. Moodys share is estimated at approximately $9 million. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. The IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with these positions taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys potential exposures (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits) could be up to $120 million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately $6 million to $10 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns. Additionally, there are potential exposures that could be up to $164 million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to Old D&B. Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B is currently in discussion with the IRS on these issues. On March 3, 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005. The third and final assessment was received in April 2006 of which Moodys paid $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys for the first two assessments included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. New D&B was unable to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its liabilities by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Legacy Tax Related Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 30 For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $2.4 million and $8.8 million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by $30.0 million, respectively. The Company also has recorded $3.5 million, $5.8 million and $3.4 million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Moodys total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of December 31, 2006 were $93 million and are classified as long term. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2006, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in each of the quarters of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.28 during the year. During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 per share of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10 K. 32 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 31 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 10 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms Moodys and the Company refer to Moodys Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services, and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: Moodys Investors Service and Moodys KMV. Moodys Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor oriented credit information, research and economic commentary, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (Old D&B) until September 30, 2000 (the Distribution Date), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies Moodys Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (New D&B). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&Bs Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the D&B Business). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the Moodys Business) and was renamed Moodys Corporation. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Distribution. Critical Accounting Estimates Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moodys uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $47 million, $36 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. 15 Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the monitoring periods range from five to 46 years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately $62 million, $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moodys estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $34 million, $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moodys establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above noted factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than Moodys estimates. In each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, commencing on page 28 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $2.4 million, $8.8 million and charges of $30 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under Legacy Tax Matters below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moodys considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Companys judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 16 Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moodys reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys pension and other post retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moodys pension and other post retirement benefit plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2006 which have not been recognized in annual expense are $ 41.0 million and Moodys expects to recognize $2.2 million of actuarial losses in 2007 annual net periodic benefit expense. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $7.8 million, of which $3.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in 2008 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2007 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2007 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2007 Estimated Impact on 2007 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.90% / 5.80% $ (5.3 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.8 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.1 ) * Discount rates of 5.90% and 5.80% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2007 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately 17 $14.4 million in 2007 compared with $14.9 million in 2006. The expected expense decrease in 2007 reflects the effects of higher discount rates, higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses, which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, under the modified prospective application method, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Previously, on January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2006 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2006 Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 2002 2006 grants 0.41% 0.52% 0.10% $ 0.6 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 2002 2006 grants 23% 30% 5% $ (4.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 2002 2006 grants 4.5 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.2 ) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moodys. Operating Segments Moodys Investors Service consists of four rating groups structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of (i) credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets, and (ii) research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit information, and research, principally produced by the rating groups, and economic commentary. For presentation purposes, Europe represents Europe, the Middle East and Africa and public finance represents U.S. public finance. Given the dominance of Moodys Investors Service to Moodys overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Companys business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moodys Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moodys KMV segment. The Moodys KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moodys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Companys authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moodys stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, 18 stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Companys common stock held on that date (the Stock Split). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Company Results Moodys revenue in 2006 was $2,037.1 million, an increase of $305.5 million or 17.6% from $1,731.6 million for the same period of 2005. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth above the rate of the overall corporation in global structured finance, corporate finance and research, and below the corporate rate in financial institutions and MKMV, with a decline in revenue from public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,277.8 million in 2006, an increase of $192.4 million or 17.7% from $1,085.4 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and corporate finance, reflecting strong issuance across most structured asset classes as well as corporate bonds and bank loans. Research, financial institutions and MKMV contributed to year over year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $759.3 million in 2006, an increase of $113.1 million or 17.5% from $646.2 million in 2005. International ratings revenue grew approximately $91 million versus the prior year, with about 84% of the growth in Europe where credit derivatives, corporate finance, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors were primary drivers of growth. European research and MKMV contributed to growth as well. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $898.7 million in 2006 were $141.9 million or 18.8% more than $756.8 million in 2005. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately $103 million in growth from prior year. Moodys average global staffing of more than 3,100 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 15% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2006 compared with year end 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,843 1,106 2,949 1,600 919 2,519 Moodys KMV 304 97 401 303 74 377 Total 2,147 1,203 3,350 1,903 993 2,896 Operating expenses were $539.4 million in 2006, an increase of $86.5 million or 19.1% from $452.9 million in 2005. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $76 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock based compensation expense. Moodys global staffing reflected hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $16.3 million year over year due, in part, to the final year of phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period and the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2006 equity grants versus 2005, offset by additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Expenses for 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $359.3 million in 2006, an increase of $55.4 million or 18.2% from $303.9 million in 2005. Year over year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $27 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in technology support and finance functions and $6.0 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additional 2006 expenses included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $12 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. 19 Operating income of $1,259.5 million in 2006, which included a 160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006, rose $319.9 million or 34.0% from $939.6 million in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, operating income increased 17%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year over year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys operating margin for 2006 was 61.8% compared to 54.3% in 2005. The gain on the sale of the building increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Moodys reported $1.0 million of interest and other non operating income (expense), net in 2006 compared with ($4.9) million in 2005. Interest expense was $15.2 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005. The amounts included $14.9 million and $20.9 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income was $18.2 million in 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The decrease was attributed to the liquidation of investment portfolios to finance share repurchases. Foreign exchange losses were immaterial in 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005. The year over year change was primarily due to the British pound and euro appreciating to the U.S. dollar. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates were reduced by benefits of $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters below for further information. Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3 million related to additional foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2006 rate was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the settlement of state tax audits. Net income was $753.9 million in 2006, an increase of $193.1 million or 34.4% from $560.8 million in 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, for 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, 2006 net income was $659.8 million, an increase of $99.0 million or 17.7%. Additionally, the gain contributed $0.33 and $0.32 relating to full year basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service in 2006 was $1,894.3 million, up $294.0 million or 18.4% from $1,600.3 million in 2005. Ratings revenue accounted for $250.6 million of growth with increased revenue in global structured finance, corporate finance and financial institutions and sovereign risk offsetting a decline in public finance. Double digit growth in research also contributed to the increase in revenue. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in revenue. Structured finance revenue was $886.7 million in 2006, an increase of $171.3 million or 23.9% from $715.4 million in the same period of 2005. Approximately $109 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the collateralized debt and commercial mortgage backed sectors contributing about 96% of the U.S. increase. Year over year issuance of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations grew, in part, to the increased repackaging of securitized assets such as consumer asset backed and mortgage backed securities, as well as bank loans in collateralized debt obligations. Strong growth in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation issuance was a key driver of overall commercial mortgage backed issuance. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $62 million year over year, with Europe contributing about $58 million, where credit derivatives, commercial mortgage backed and residential mortgage backed sectors totaled 92% of the European growth. Foreign currency translation for structured finance positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $2 million. Corporate finance revenue was $396.2 million in 2006, up $73.0 million or 22.6% from $323.2 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 22% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. Investment grade bond issuance increased approximately 17% and high yield bond issuance increased approximately 43%, primarily due to significant mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and second lien loan activity. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $28 million or about 24% due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Price increases also contributed to year over year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $266.8 million in 2006, an increase of $12.2 million or 4.8% from $254.6 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in insurance and real estate sectors. Internationally, revenue increased $1.5 million compared to the prior year period. Public finance revenue was $85.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $5.9 million or 6.4% from $91.8 million in 2005. Dollar volume issuance in the municipal bond market declined compared to 2005, primarily due to lower refinancing activity. 20 Research revenue of $258.7 million in 2006 was $43.4 million or 20.2% higher than $215.3 million in 2005. Revenue grew by approximately $28 million in the U.S. and about $15 million internationally, with Europe accounting for approximately 41% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $17 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on the corporate finance, financial institutions and the structured finance related businesses. Revenue from the licensing of Moodys information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $57 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $8 million, or about 17% higher than the prior year. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $789.1 million in 2006, an increase of $143.7 million or 22.3% from $645.4 million in 2005. The largest contributor to 2006 expenses was growth in compensation and benefits of approximately $110 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses and higher stock based compensation expense of $21.4 million. Furthermore, expenses in 2006 included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $11 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moodys new corporate headquarters. Additional increases were due to increased information technology investment spending of approximately $8 million offset by a decrease of approximately $6 million in legal fees. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, expenses in 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. Moodys Investors Service operating income of $1,242.9 million in 2006 was up $306.6 million or 32.7% from $936.3 million in 2005, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moodys corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain, operating income increased 15.6%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year to year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moodys KMV MKMV revenue of $142.8 million in 2006 was $11.5 million or 8.8% more than the same period in 2005. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increased demand for credit decision making software and software related maintenance services, which grew approximately 10% or $2.7 million compared to 2005. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately 5% or $4.9 million compared to prior year and risk services revenue increased approximately $4 million or about 36% compared to prior year. In 2006, international MKMV revenue accounted for 56% of its global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $109.6 million in 2006, a decrease of $1.8 million or 1.6% from $111.4 million in 2005. The 2006 expenses include a total of $3.5 million due to training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, 2006 expenses include a $2.2 million charge recorded in connection with a non income tax matter. The 2005 expenses included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $16.6 million for 2006 compared with $3.3 million in 2005. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moodys revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moodys achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year to year growth as well. Moodys international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. 21 Moodys operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moodys average global staffing of approximately 2,700 employees during the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately 12% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moodys staffing at year end 2005 compared with year end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moodys Investors Service 1,600 919 2,519 1,358 761 2,119 Moodys KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,903 993 2,896 1,687 829 2,516 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moodys global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year to year. As more fully discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year to year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year to year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions and $8.3 million related to stock based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million, or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moodys operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moodys reported $4.9 million of interest and other non operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moodys $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moodys effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters, below). Additionally, Moodys recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. 22 Segment Results Moodys Investors Service Revenue at Moodys Investors Service for 2005 was $1,600.3 million, up $282.8 million or 21.5% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $241.2 million of growth with approximately 80% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low adjustable rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year to year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $323.2 million for 2005, up $23.6 million or 7.9% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year to year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part, related to Moodys Enhanced Analysis Initiative, which also contributed to year to year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance in 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moodys information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moodys Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moodys operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year to year growth in reported expenses. 23 Moodys Investors Service operating income of $936.3 million in 2005 was up $154.1 million or 19.7% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year to year growth in operating income. Moodys KMV Moodys KMV revenue of $131.3 million for 2005 was $10.5 million or 8.7% more than the same period in 2004. MKMVs revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. MKMVs operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $3.3 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year to year impact on MKMV results. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 21 countries outside the United States. Approximately 29% of the Companys revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 36% of the Companys expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 30% of Moodys assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $408.1 million at December 31, 2006, approximately $232 million was located outside the United States (with $121 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $75.4 million, approximately $14 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders equity. Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In 2006, the Company entered into two insignificant hedging transactions using purchased put options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks from forecasted billings denominated in euros. Under the Companys current foreign exchange hedging program, the Company hedges currency risk exclusively for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact revenue. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into future hedging transactions and the Company does not have any material derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $752.5 million, $707.9 million and $526.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased by $44.6 million compared with 2005. Growth in net income contributed $193.1 million to cash provided by operating activities. The 2006 cash flows include a decrease 24 relating to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans of $103.2 million that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities as required under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation was presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow, along with other tax cash flows. The operating cash flow includes a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Companys headquarters building. The cash proceeds are reported as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in accounts receivable is attributable to increases in revenue offset by improved collection. Additionally, Moodys deposited approximately $40 million with the IRS in the first quarter of 2006 relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. This deposit was recorded in other assets. Tax payments increased by $53 million in 2006 versus 2005 offset by increases in income taxes payable due to growth in pre tax net income. An increase in deferred revenue increased cash flow from operations by $28 million which is due to increased volume in annual and initial fees in both the ratings and research businesses. Moodys net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non cash stock based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year to year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year over year non cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in Contingencies Legacy Tax Matters. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $116.1 million, ($150.4) million and ($31.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures, primarily for property and equipment and internal use software, totaled $31.1 million, $31.3 million and $21.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net maturities (investments) in marketable securities totaled $22.5 million, ($88.9) million and ($6.5) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 spending on acquisitions was $39.2 million, which related primarily to the purchase of a 49% share in China Cheng Xin International Credit Rating Co. Ltd and the acquisition of Wall Street Analytics, Inc., net of cash acquired. The 2005 spending on acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and a contingent payment made in the second quarter of 2005 related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount primarily related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The net proceeds received from the sale of the Companys headquarters building at 99 Church Street, New York, New York in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $965.2 million, $666.5 million and $162.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $1,093.6 million in 2006, $691.7 million in 2005 and $221.3 million in 2004. Dividends paid were $79.5 million, $60.3 million and $44.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.07 per share in 2006, $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share in 2004. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.3 million in 2006, $89.1 million in 2005 and $105.0 million in 2004. The 2006 amount also includes $103.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities under SFAS No. 123R Future Cash Requirements Moodys currently expects to fund expenditures from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2007. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5 1 program. Moodys may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During 25 August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. The Companys intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moodys long term interests. As a result, Moodys share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the Lease) commencing on October 20, 2006 with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new headquarters. The Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. The Company will incur approximately $110 million of costs in 2007 to fit out the new headquarters. The costs will be paid for using the proceeds from the sale of the Companys current corporate headquarters building. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes (Notes). The Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (Old Notes) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the Prepaid Principal), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the Prepaid Principal. On September 1, 2004, Moodys entered into a five year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364 day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Companys ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Earnings Coverage Ratio), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2006, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Companys Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2006. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the Agreements) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. In October 2006, Moodys amended its Facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a sale leaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building at 99 Church Street from $150 million to $250 million. Additionally, the 26 restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the sale of 99 Church Street was also increased from $150 million to $250 million. The Company also increased the expansion feature of the credit facility from $80 million to $340 million, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders. This increase gives the Company potential borrowing capacity under the Facility of $500 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 430.7 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 356.0 Capital lease obligations 1.0 0.5 0.5 Operating lease obligations (2) 639.5 34.5 80.4 62.2 462.4 Purchase obligations (3) 30.4 23.6 6.7 0.1 Total (4) $ 1,101.6 $ 73.5 $ 117.5 $ 92.2 $ 818.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2006 and $127.0 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Includes the new operating lease agreement, which commenced on October 20, 2006, between the Company and 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moodys new corporate headquarters in mid to late 2007. See Future Cash Requirements for further information. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for professional services, data processing services, telecommunication services and data back up facilities. (4) In early 2007, the Company entered into contractual obligations of approximately $110 million related to the buildout of its new corporate headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. These amounts are not included in the table above. 2007 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2007 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2007. This growth assumes foreign currency translation in 2007 at current exchange rates, which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation. Excluding the gain on sale of the 99 Church Street building, Moodys expects the operating margin to decline by approximately 150 basis points in 2007, due to investments the Company is continuing to make to sustain business growth, including international expansion, improving analytical processes, pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introducing new products, improving technology infrastructure and relocating Moodys headquarters in New York City. Diluted earnings per share in 2007 are projected to be modestly lower compared to 2006 as a result of the after tax gain of $94.1 million on the sale of the 99 Church Street headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the U.S., the Company projects low double digit percent revenue growth for the Moodys Investors Service ratings and research business for the full year 2007. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moodys expects revenue for the year to rise 27 in the high single to double digit percent range, including strong double digit year over year percent growth in revenue from credit derivatives and commercial mortgage backed securities ratings, partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from residential mortgage backed securities ratings, including home equity securitization. In the U.S. corporate finance business, Moodys expects revenue growth in the low double digit percent range for the year, including good growth from rated bonds, bank loans and new products. The Company anticipates a stronger first half of 2007 followed by a weaker second half in this sector, due in part to an expected moderation in the pace of leveraged buyout transactions. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects revenue in 2007 to grow in the low teens percent range for the year. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moodys expects revenue for 2007 to grow modestly. The Company forecasts growth in the U.S. research business to be about 20%. Outside the U.S., Moodys expects ratings revenue to grow in the high teens percent range with mid to high teens percent growth in all major business lines, led by corporate finance revenue growth in Europe and Asia, financial institutions growth in Europe and growth in international structured finance. The Company also projects about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moodys KMV globally, the Company expects growth in sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software and professional services. This should result in low double digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on recognition and derecognition of tax benefits resulting from a subsequent change of judgment, classification of liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. In accordance with FIN No. 48, a company is required to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority, without considering time values. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and accordingly, is required to be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company expects a reduction of retained earnings of between $40 million and $45 million with no impact to the statement of operations and cash flows. This is based on a preliminary assessment and could change based on final analysis which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. After the initial adoption of FIN No. 48, the financial impacts to the statement of operations and cash flows is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of legacy tax matters and other tax matters with the taxing authorities. The Company is unable to predict the final resolution of these matters. See Note 16, Contingencies for further discussion of legacy tax matters. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value whereby fair value is based on an exit price that would result from market participants behavior, as well as sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value. SFAS No. 157 imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements and is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impacts that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moodys. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits 28 in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moodys business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moodys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moodys has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moodys as Legacy Contingencies. The principal Legacy Contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters. To understand the Companys exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moodys and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (ACNielsen) and Cognizant Corporation (Cognizant). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (NMR). In September 2000, Old D&B through a spin off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one half, and New D&B and Moodys are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as Amortization Expense Deductions for which New D&B and Moodys are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have, between themselves, agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions This matter related to the IRSs stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 as well as the IRSs intention to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for 1996. These matters were settled with the IRS in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of 2005 and accordingly, the Company reduced its reserve for this matter by $11.5 million. However, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&Bs calculation of each partys share of the liability. New D&B may commence arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the $7.3 million that New D&B and Moodys each were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions that New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B will prevail, but Moodys cannot predict with certainty the outcome. 29 In the second quarter of 2006, Moodys paid approximately $9 million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the October 2005 settlement with the IRS and reversed the remaining reserve of $1.5 million. Additionally, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRSs denial of the tax refunds. In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS Appeals Office rejected New D&Bs protest. New D&B is determining whether to file suit for the refund. Moodys share is estimated at approximately $9 million. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the April Examination Reports) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. The IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with these positions taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old D&Bs or New D&Bs tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moodys from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moodys would have to pay to New D&B its share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moodys at the Distribution Date. Moodys estimates that the Companys potential exposures (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits) could be up to $120 million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately $6 million to $10 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns. Additionally, there are potential exposures that could be up to $164 million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to Old D&B. Moodys also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B is currently in discussion with the IRS on these issues. On March 3, 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. Moodys believes that the IRSs proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moodys believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005. The third and final assessment was received in April 2006 of which Moodys paid $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moodys for the first two assessments included its share of approximately $4 million that Moodys and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&Bs calculation of their respective shares of the payments. New D&B was unable to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them. Moodys believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moodys had increased its liabilities by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moodys Exposure to Legacy Tax Related Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moodys makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 30 For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $2.4 million and $8.8 million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by $30.0 million, respectively. The Company also has recorded $3.5 million, $5.8 million and $3.4 million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Moodys total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of December 31, 2006 were $93 million and are classified as long term. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. In matters where Moodys believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moodys may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moodys believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2006, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in each of the quarters of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.28 during the year. During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moodys common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 per share of Moodys common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
