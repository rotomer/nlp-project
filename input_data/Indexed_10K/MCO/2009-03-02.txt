ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This MD&A contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 53 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 18 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. THE COMPANY Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings and related research, data and analytical tools, (ii) quantitative credit risk measures, risk scoring software and credit portfolio management solutions and (iii) software for fixed income pricing data and valuation models. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. These offerings include quantitative credit risk scores, credit processing software, economic research, analytical models, financial data, securities pricing and valuation services, and specialized consulting services. MA also distributes investor oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its rating process, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, and commentary on topical credit related events. Beginning in January 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moodys other non rating commercial activities, including MKMV and sales of research produced by MIS analysts and the production and sales of other products and services, are represented in the MA segment. As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business. Within MA, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and consulting businesses. The subscriptions business includes credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software business includes license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products; and the consulting business includes professional services and credit training associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis. Subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12 month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual periods. The following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments, excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company are allocated to each segment based on a revenue split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resource, information technology and legal. In addition to its reported results, Moodys has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as non GAAP financial measures. Management believes that such non GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Companys performance. These non GAAP financial measures relate to Legacy Tax Matters and adjustments made to the Companys 2007 Restructuring Plan, further described in Note 17 and Note 10, respectively, to the Companys consolidated financial statements. MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 27 Table of Contents Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, MIS uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where MIS does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, MIS defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, deferred revenue included approximately $48 million, $54 million and $47 million, respectively, related to such monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods, ranging from three to 51 years, which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $82 million, $86 million and $72 million, respectively. MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, accounts receivable included approximately $34 million, $38 million and $34 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Revenue earned within the MA segment relating to the three lines of business are recognized as follows: subscription based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial 12 month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods, beginning upon delivery of the initial product; software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs; consulting revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed. Certain revenue arrangements within the MA segment include multiple elements such as software licenses, maintenance, subscription fees and professional services. In these types of arrangements, the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value; that is, generally the price charged when sold separately or vendor specific objective evidence. 28 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are recorded against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moodys adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates. In each of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company revised its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this MD&A, commencing on page 51 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities. Based on its review of the latest information available, and subject to the contingencies described in Item 7. MD&A Contingencies, the ultimate monetary liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Moodys future reported results and financial position. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $8.7 million, $27.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys liabilities for Legacy Tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are more fully described under the caption Legacy Tax Matters within Item 7, MD&A. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, annually as of November 30th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. As of the 2008 impairment test, the reporting units were determined to be MIS, MA and Fermat. To test goodwill for impairment the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill and if the fair value exceeds its carrying value then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value then goodwill is not impaired; otherwise, an impairment loss will be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value. The Company allocates corporate items to the carrying value of the reporting unit based on the same methodology as corporate and overhead expenses are allocated. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, terminal values, discount rates, determination of Moodys weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit, and an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Moodys allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis. MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 29 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Restructuring The Company has engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs, contract termination costs and asset impairments. If the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted. For a full description of Moodys restructuring actions, refer to the Results of Operations section below and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moodys reports for its pension and other post retirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2008 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys Post Retirement Plans. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moodys Post Retirement Plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2008 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $27.1 million, and Moodys expects to recognize in net periodic pension expense $0.8 million for the amortization of actuarial losses. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has an unrecognized asset loss of $32.6 million, of which $7.6 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2010 expense. 30 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2009 operating income. These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2009 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moodys Post Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for2009 Estimated Impact on2009 Operating Income(Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 6.00%/6.25% $ (5.4 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.2 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.2 ) * Discount rates of 6.00% and 6.25% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2009 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to Post Retirement Plans will be $15.2 million in 2009 compared with $14.2 million in 2008, excluding the costs of curtailment and special termination benefits of $3.8 million in 2008. The expected expense increase in 2009 reflects the effects of lower discount rates, higher amortization of actuarial losses, and higher loss on plan assets. Stock Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payments. Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2008 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used for2004 2008 grants Increase inAssumption Estimated Impact onOperating Income in 2008Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 0.1% 1.9% 0.10% $ 0.4 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 23% 37.3% 5% $ (4.2 ) Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (3.4 ) Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Companys tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter company transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. Moodys is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve Legacy Tax and other tax matters. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its FIN 48 tax liabilities. On January 1, 2007, upon the implementation of FIN 48, the Company implemented the accounting policy to classify interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements and to classify associated penalties, if any, as part of other non operating expenses. Prior to the implementation of FIN 48, the Company had classified interest related to income taxes and associated penalties as components of income tax expense. In accordance with FIN 48, prior period financial statements have not been reclassified for this change. MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 31 Table of Contents FIN 48 requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. Upon the initial implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded a reduction of its January 1, 2007 retained earnings of $43.3 million, which is comprised of $32.9 million of tax and accrued interest of $17.3 million ($10.4 million, net of tax). As the determination of FIN 48 liabilities and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Companys operating results or financial condition. Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moodys. OPERATING SEGMENTS Beginning in January 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moodys other non rating commercial activities, including MKMV and sales of research produced by MIS analysts and the production and sales of other products and services, are represented in the MA segment. As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business. Within MA, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and consulting businesses. The subscriptions business includes credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software business includes license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products, and the consulting business includes professional services and credit training associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis. Subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12 month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual periods. The following is a discussion of the results of operations of the new segments, excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company, all of which were previously included in the former MIS segment, are allocated to each new segment based on a revenue split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resource, information technology and legal. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 32 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2008 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007 Executive summary Moodys revenue for 2008 totaled $1,755.4 million, a decrease of 22% from $2,259.0 million in 2007. Operating income was $748.2 million, down $382.8 million or 34% from $1,131.0 million in 2007. Excluding the positive impact from FX translation, global revenue and operating income declined 23% and 36%, respectively. Diluted EPS of $1.87 for 2008 included a benefit of $0.05 related to the resolution of certain Legacy Tax Matters and minor adjustments to the 2007 restructuring. Excluding the Legacy Tax Matters and impact of restructuring in both years, diluted EPS of $1.82 for 2008 decreased 27% from $2.50 for 2007. Revenue at MIS totaled $1,204.7 million for 2008, a decrease of $575.2 million, or 32% from 2007. Excluding the positive impact from FX translation, revenue declined $591.7 million, or 33% from prior year. U.S. revenue of $645.0 million decreased $474.0 million or 42%, while non U.S. revenue of $559.7 million decreased $101.2 million or 15% from the prior year. The public, project and infrastructure business line achieved modest growth. Due to the credit market crisis that began in mid 2007 all other MIS business lines recorded declines from the prior year, led by structured finance. MA revenue rose to $550.7 million for 2008, up 15% from 2007 with all lines of business growing. U.S. revenue of $265.1 million for 2008 increased 9% from 2007. Non U.S. revenue of $285.6 million increased 21% from 2007 and represented 52% of global revenue, compared to 49% a year earlier. Total expenses for Moodys Corporation of $1,007.2 million were down $120.8 million compared to the prior year. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2007 and minor adjustments to this charge in 2008, Moodys total expenses were $68.3 million, or 6%, lower in 2008, due primarily to lower compensation costs. Moodys Corporation The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, % Change 2008 2007 Revenue: United States $ 910.1 $ 1,361.8 (33.2 )% International: EMEA 603.1 659.3 (8.5 )% Other 242.2 237.9 1.8 % Total International 845.3 897.2 (5.8 )% Total $ 1,755.4 $ 2,259.0 (22.3 )% Expenses: Operating $ 493.3 $ 584.0 (15.5 )% SG&A 441.3 451.1 (2.2 )% Restructuring (2.5 ) 50.0 (105.0 )% Depreciation and amortization 75.1 42.9 75.1 % Total $ 1,007.2 $ 1,128.0 (10.7 )% Operating income $ 748.2 $ 1,131.0 (33.8 )% Interest (expense) income, net $ (52.2 ) $ (24.3 ) 114.8 % Other non operating (expense) income, net $ 29.8 $ 10.0 198.0 % Net income $ 457.6 $ 701.5 (34.8 )% Total revenue of $1,755.4 million decreased $503.6 million from 2007, due to the significant decline in MIS partly offset by good growth in MA. Total relationship and transaction based revenue for Moodys in 2008 was 64% and 36%, respectively, compared to 45% and 55%, respectively in the prior year. Relationship revenue in the MIS segment represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation and or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes and shelf registrations, while transaction revenue represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other one time fees. In the MA segment, relationship revenue represents the entire subscription based business line and the MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 33 Table of Contents maintenance revenue within the software line of business. Transaction revenue in MA represents the license fees for credit risk software products and revenue from the consulting line of business which offers professional services and credit training, which are typically sold on a per engagement basis. U.S. revenue was $910.1 million, down $451.7 million from the prior year primarily reflecting significantly reduced issuance activity due to the broader downturn in global economic activity, significant financial market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads. International revenue of $845.3 million decreased $51.9 million from 2007 and accounted for 48% of global revenue compared to 40% a year ago. FX translation contributed approximately $23 million to 2008 international revenue. Issuance volumes were significantly lower across most of the EMEA and Asian markets compared to 2007. Operating expenses were $493.3 million, down $90.7 million due primarily to lower compensation costs of $70.5 million. Incentive compensation of $30.8 million decreased $27.8 million due to weak financial performance within the MIS segment and the impact of restructuring. Salaries and wages decreased approximately $21 million primarily reflecting the effects of the 2007 restructuring. Stock based compensation of $40.6 million declined $17.3 million due to the impact of the 2007 restructuring which resulted in higher forfeitures of awards than in the previous year. Non compensation costs of $76.6 million decreased $20.2 million due to strong cost controls, particularly in the areas of T&E and recruiting which declined approximately $9 million and $3 million, respectively. SG&A expenses of $441.3 million decreased $9.8 million from the prior year due to declines in both compensation and non compensation expenses. Compensation costs decreased $4.9 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting reductions of approximately $5 million and $10 million in incentive and stock based compensation, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an approximate $9 million increase in salaries and wages due primarily to $6 million in senior executive severance expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Non compensation expenses of $207.4 million were down $4.9 million from prior year reflecting decreases in T&E, rent and occupancy costs, and professional service fees of $4.6 million, $5.4 million and $6.8 million, respectively, partially offset by approximately $11 million of bad debt reflecting the increase in bankruptcies and collection issues, compared to less than $1 million in 2007. The table below shows Moodys global staffing by geographic area: DECEMBER 31, 2008* 2007 % Change United States 2,130 2,175 (2.1 )% International 1,817 1,397 30.1 % Total 3,947 3,572 10.5 % * reflects approximately 350 additional headcount due to acquisitions made during the year, of which approximately 290 were added in the fourth quarter. Restructuring in 2008 reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization of $75.1 million increased $32.2 million from 2007 primarily due to: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, approximately $6 million of incremental depreciation reflecting the use of 7WTC for the full year of 2008, approximately $6 million of purchase accounting amortization associated with the acquisition of Fermat of which $4.5 million was a write off of acquired in process technology and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Companys New Jersey office in the second quarter of 2008. Operating income in 2008 of $748.2 million decreased $382.8 million from the prior year reflecting the significant decline in revenue resulting in an operating margin of 42.6%, which was 750 basis points lower than the 50.1% margin in 2007. Operating income in 2007 reflected a $50.0 million restructuring charge. FX translation positively impacted operating income by approximately $28 million. Net interest expense was $52.2 million, an increase of $27.9 million from prior year primarily due to higher debt levels and the absence in 2008 of $17.5 million of income relating to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $2.3 million in 2008. 34 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents Other non operating income was $29.8 million, up about 200% from the prior year, due primarily to FX gains of approximately $25 million recorded during the year reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the euro to the British pound. Moodys effective tax rate of 37.0% remained essentially flat with 37.2% in 2007. Excluding the impact of restructuring and Legacy Tax items in both years, Moodys ETR was 37.3%, down 290 bps from 40.2% in 2007, due primarily to a larger portion of consolidated taxable income being generated from outside the U.S., which is generally taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rate, and the realization of benefits available for U.S. based manufacturing and research activities. Net income was $457.6 million, a decrease of $243.9 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting revenue declines that outpaced cost reductions. Excluding the impact of Legacy Tax Matters and restructuring, net income of $445.3 million was $235.3 million lower than 2007. Diluted EPS was $1.87, or 28% lower than in the prior year resulting from the 35% reduction in net income, partially offset by 10% fewer diluted shares outstanding. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further analysis and commentary: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 2007 % Change Revenue: Structured finance $ 411.2 $ 873.3 (52.9 )% Corporate finance 300.5 411.5 (27.0 )% Financial institutions 263.0 274.3 (4.1 )% Public, project and infrastructure finance 230.0 220.8 4.2 % Total $ 1,204.7 $ 1,779.9 (32.3 )% Expenses: Operating and SG&A $ 636.0 $ 759.4 (16.2 )% Restructuring (1.6 ) 41.3 (103.9 )% Depreciation and amortization 33.3 24.0 38.8 % Total $ 667.7 $ 824.7 (19.0 )% Operating income $ 537.0 $ 955.2 (43.8 )% Global MIS revenue of $1,204.7 million was down $575.2 million from 2007, reflecting the significant declines in global SFG and U.S. CFG revenue. In the U.S., revenue of $645.0 million was down $474.0 million, or 42%, due to decreases in SFG and CFG. Internationally, revenue was $559.7 million, a decline of $101.2 million, or 15%, from a year ago, with declines in SFG and CFG, partially offset by growth in PPIF. In 2008, international revenue comprised 46% of global revenue, compared to 37% in 2007. FX contributed approximately $16 million to international revenue in 2008. The split of revenue between relationship and transaction was 51% and 49%, respectively, versus the prior year when the split was 32% relationship and 68% transaction revenue. Globally, the lower proportion of transaction revenue in 2008 was primarily due to the significant decline in new issuance due to the broader downturn in global economic activity reflected in the extreme market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads in the later part of the year. Global SFG revenue decreased $462.1 million, due to declines in derivatives, CREF and RMBS of $194.5 million or 57%, $123.8 million or 69%, and $103.1 million or 58%, respectively, which together accounted for 91% of the decrease. Continued turbulence in the capital and credit markets, combined with lack of market liquidity and higher interest rate spreads, has resulted in lower loan origination and securitization which led to a significant decline in new issuance revenue. In 2008, transaction based revenue accounted for 51% of total SFG down from 77% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $190.7 million was down $370.7 million or 66%, from a year ago, led by declines in the aforementioned asset classes due to significantly reduced issuance volume. International revenue was $220.5 million, a decrease of $91.4 million or 29% from 2007, led by declines in derivatives and CREF of $48.5 million or 42%, and $41.6 million or 66%, respectively. FX translation contributed approximately $8 million to international SFG revenue in 2008. Global CFG revenue was down $111.0 million from prior year, due to low issuance volumes particularly in the U.S. Revenue from new issuance declined approximately $121 million, or 43% from the prior year, due primarily to lower issuance in both investment grade and speculative grade securities, resulting from the broader downturn in global economic activity, reflected in MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 35 Table of Contents the significant financial market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads in the later part of the year. Transaction based revenue comprised 53% of global CFG revenue, compared to 68% in 2007. Revenue in the U.S. was $176.6 million, a decrease of $93.4 million, or 35%, from the prior year as revenue from bank loans and speculative grade bond ratings declined $64.1 million or 66% and $30.6 million or 62%, respectively, and was slightly offset by $6.6 million, or 18%, of growth in revenue from monitoring fees. International revenue of $123.9 million was down $17.6 million, or 12%, from prior year comprised of declines in speculative grade bond ratings, bank loan ratings, estimated ratings and investment grade bond ratings of $10.4 million or 56%, $7.4 million or 67%, $4.4 million or 25%, and $3.7 million or 13%, respectively. These declines were offset by growth in monitoring fees of $5.3 million, as well as a $2.7 million increase in other CFG services such as national scale ratings and company credit assessment services. FX translation contributed approximately $3 million to international CFG revenue in 2008. Global FIG revenue decreased $11.3 million from the prior year reflecting significant declines in issuance volumes primarily in the U.S. insurance and banking markets due to the on going credit crisis. Revenue from new transactions accounted for 33% of total FIG in 2008, compared to 42% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $117.8 million decreased $12.2 million, or 9%, from prior year, led by an $8.9 million decline in the insurance sector, specifically the property and casualty insurance industry which was down $5.0 million or 22% from 2007. International revenue of $145.2 million remained flat with prior year reflecting growth from the life insurance industry offset by declines from rating financial guarantors and the property and casualty insurance industry. FX translation contributed $5 million to international FIG revenue in 2008. Global PPIF revenue increased $9.2 million from prior year due to growth in municipal structured products and in the project and infrastructure finance sectors of $10.3 million or 35%, and $2.5 million or 3%, respectively. Recurring revenue represented 41% of total in 2008 compared with 40% in 2007. In the U.S., revenue of $159.9 million grew $2.3 million, with increases in the aforementioned municipal structured products partially offset by declines of $6.4 million in other public finance issuance. Outside the U.S., revenue of $70.1 million was up $6.9 million, or 11%, from prior year, reflecting growth primarily within the EMEA region of $4.6 million and $2.1 million in the infrastructure finance and public finance sectors, respectively. Operating and SG&A expenses of $636.0 million, including allocated corporate overhead costs, decreased $123.4 million, with declines in both compensation and non compensation expenses of approximately $83 million and approximately $40 million, respectively. Incentive compensation decreased approximately $39 million primarily due to weak financial performance. Stock based compensation decreased approximately $20 million primarily reflecting the impact of the 2007 Restructuring Plan which resulted in higher forfeitures of awards than in the previous year. Salary and benefits expense decreased approximately $24 million from prior year, reflecting the change in the mix of employees and timing of adding new hires during the year, partially offset by approximately $6 million in senior executive severance expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in non compensation expenses from 2007 reflected continued strong cost controls, resulting in reductions within T&E, recruiting and marketing of $14.6 million, $3.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Offsetting these decreases in 2008 was an $8.1 million increase in bad debt expense compared to prior year, primarily related to bankruptcies and collection issues, including $2.3 million for Lehman Brothers and $1.7 million for issuers of structured investment vehicles. The 2008 restructuring amount primarily reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.3 million primarily due to the accelerated depreciation recorded in the second quarter of 2008 relating to the Jersey City office closure and a full year of depreciation on 7WTC assets. Operating income decreased $418.2 million from 2007 reflecting the 32% reduction in revenue outpacing the 19% decline in Operating and SG&A expenses. Excluding the impact of the 2007 restructuring and minor adjustments made in 2008 relating to this charge, operating income declined $461.1 million or 46% from the prior year. FX translation had a positive impact of approximately $17 million on MIS operating income in 2008. 36 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents Moodys Analytics The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, % Change 2008 2007 Revenue: Subscriptions $ 475.9 $ 421.5 12.9 % Software 49.2 39.5 24.6 % Consulting 25.6 18.1 41.4 % Total $ 550.7 $ 479.1 14.9 % Expenses: Operating and SG&A $ 298.6 $ 275.7 8.3 % Restructuring (0.9 ) 8.7 (110.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 41.8 18.9 121.2 % Total $ 339.5 $ 303.3 11.9 % Operating income $ 211.2 $ 175.8 20.1 % Global MA revenue increased $71.6 million, with 69% of the growth generated internationally, and accounted for 31% of global MCO revenue in 2008 compared to 21% in the prior year. Recurring revenue, which includes subscription and software maintenance fees, comprised 91% of the total in 2008, Compared to 92% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $265.1 million increased 9%, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenue. International revenue of $285.6 million was $49.3 million higher than in 2007, reflecting growth in all business lines, particularly the software line of business which benefited from the acquisition of Fermat. FX translation contributed approximately $7 million to international MA revenue in 2008. Global subscription revenue, which comprises 86% of total MA in 2008, increased $54.4 million and accounted for 76% of global MA growth, reflecting continued demand from new and existing customers for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics, credit risk assessment and other offerings. U.S. revenue was $239.4 million, an increase of $20.3 million from 2007. Internationally, revenue totaled $236.5 million, an increase of $34.1 million or 17% over the prior year, with 78% of the growth generated within the EMEA region. Global software revenue increased $9.7 million, including the positive impact of the Fermat acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $20.0 million remained flat with prior year, while international revenue of $29.2 million increased $9.0 million or 45% from the prior year with growth generated from all regions. Global consulting revenue increased $7.5 million over prior year reflecting relatively higher demand internationally for credit education, portfolio analysis, risk modeling and scorecard development services, primarily in the EMEA region. Operating and SG&A expenses, including allocated corporate overhead costs, were $298.6, an increase of $22.9 million from the prior year due to increases in both compensation and non compensation expenses of approximately $8 million and approximately $15 million, respectively. The increase in compensation expense primarily reflects approximately $6 million of higher incentive compensation costs due to better than expected financial performance, and a 30% increase in average headcount due to acquisitions made during the year. Non compensation expenses of $98.0 million increased due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and a higher proportion of allocated corporate overhead expenses in 2008 compared to prior year based on the revenue split methodology, as well as the absence in 2008 of a $2.5 million sales tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2007. The 2008 restructuring amount primarily reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. The increase in depreciation and amortization of $22.9 million compared to 2007 is primarily due to the approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and amortization of approximately $6 million related to the Fermat acquisition, including a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology. Operating income increased $35.4 million from 2007, reflecting strong revenue growth and an approximate $10 million positive impact from FX translation.

The main contributors to this growth were from the CFG line of business within MIS and from MA. Revenue from MA contributed 37% of the Companys year over year growth, driven primarily by the subscriptions line of businesses. Revenue in the U.S. was $1,361.8 million in 2007, an increase of $84.0 million, or 7%, from $1,277.8 million in 2006.

Compensation and benefits continue to be Moodys largest expense, accounting for approximately 70% of total Operating and SG&A expenses, representing approximately $77 million in growth from prior year. Moodys average global staffing of approximately 3,500 employees during the year ended December 31, 2007 was approximately 13% higher than during 2006. This increase reflects the impact of hiring from late 2006 and the first half of 2007 to support business growth mainly in the U.S., Asian and European ratings businesses offset by a partial completion of the workforce reductions relating to the restructuring actions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2007. The table below shows Moodys global staffing by geographic area.

Compensation and benefits expense comprised approximately 77% of the growth, reflecting normal salary increases coupled with higher staffing levels compared to prior year, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The staffing level increase reflects hiring in the first half of 2007 to support business growth, primarily in the international ratings businesses, where head count increased by approximately 14% over 2006. Non compensation expenses of $96.8 million increased $10.2 million, primarily from higher professional service costs associated with technology investments. SG&A expenses were $451.1 million in 2007, an increase of $91.8 million, or 25.5%, from $359.3 million in 2006. Compensation expense of $238.8 million increased $46.5 million, or 24.2%, from 2006 reflecting increased staffing levels in the corporate compliance and technology support functions coupled with the increase in stock based compensation. Non compensation expense of $212.3 million was up $45.3 million, or 27.1%, over 2006 due to higher rent and occupancy costs of $39.3 million, or 88.2%, over 2006 primarily related to the Companys relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and an increase in professional service costs of $21.6 million relating to technology investment spending and legal matters. Operating income in 2007 includes a $50.0 million restructuring charge consisting of $45.9 million of expenses relating to severance and other employee benefit costs and $4.1 million for contract termination costs, as further discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating income of $1,131.0 million decreased $128.5 million, or 10.2%, from $1,259.5 million in 2006, which reflected a $160.6 million gain on building sale and approximately $21 million of FX translation gains in 2007.

Interest expense on borrowings was $40.7 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase was due to borrowings under the Companys credit facilities, the issuance of the $300.0 million Series 2007 1 Notes in September 2007, and issuance under the Companys commercial paper program, which was established in October 2007. Interest expense on FIN 48 and other tax liabilities was $21.5 million in 2007. In 2006, before FIN 48 became effective, interest on tax liabilities was reported as part of income tax expense, net of federal tax benefit. Included in 2007 was a $17.5 million reduction of accrued interest expense and a $14.4 million increase in other non operating income relating to the resolution of a certain Legacy Tax Matter more fully described in Contingencies Legacy Contingencies, below. Interest income earned on short term investments and invested cash balances were $19.3 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Revenue of $561.5 million in the U.S. decreased $36.2 million, or 6%, in a mixed year where strong growth in the first half of 2007, largely from credit derivatives and CREF was offset in the second half of 2007 by declining revenue in the RMBS, derivatives and CREF as a result of credit market turmoil which reduced ratable issuance volume. Outside the U.S., revenue of $311.8 million increased $36.9 million, or 13%, reflecting strong growth from derivatives and RMBS of $19.8 million and $12.3 million, respectively, mostly in EMEA. Global CFG revenue totaled $411.5 million in 2007, an increase of 75.6 million from 2006. Revenue in the U.S. increased $45.3 million, or 20.2%, primarily due to increased leveraged loan activities and growth in investment grade bond issuance. International revenue of $141.5 million increased $30.3 million, or 27.2%, largely driven by growth in European bond issuance. Global FIG revenue was $274.3 million, up $41.2 million from $233.1 million in 2006. Revenue in the U.S. increased $19.6 million, or 18%, principally due to strong performance within the banking and insurance sectors driven by debt refinancing and funding for share repurchases. International revenue of $144.3 million grew $21.6 million, or 18%, from prior year mainly due to increased corporate bond issuance activity and a significant number of new ratings mandates both within the European banking sector. Global PPIF revenue was $220.8 million, an increase of $22.6 million from 2006. Revenue from project and infrastructure finance of $76.1 million showed the strongest growth with an increase of $13.5 million, or 21.6%, over 2006, mostly from within the United States. Revenue of $115.2 million from the public finance sector, including U.S. public finance, sovereign and sub sovereign, increased $6.1 million, or 6%, over prior year driven by growth in combined issuance and new money issuance. Operating and SG&A expenses, including allocated corporate overhead costs, were $759.4 million, an increase of $93.3 million from $666.1 million in 2006. Compensation and benefits expense was the largest contributor to the year over year growth reflecting increased staffing internationally to support business growth, as well as additional head count in the corporate compliance group. Stock based compensation expense increased year over year primarily due to the higher Black Scholes value of the 2007 equity grants compared to prior years. Non compensation expenses in 2007 included an increase in allocated expenses such as increased rent and occupancy costs related to the Companys relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and increases in professional service costs primarily due to information technology investment spending and legal matters. Operating income of $955.2 million in 2007 was flat compared to 2006.

U.S. revenue of $242.8 million increased $38.1 million, or 18.6%, and international revenue increased $43.7 million, or 22.7%, with 90.3% of the growth from within the EMEA region. Revenue from subscription products of $421.5 million was up $74.0 million compared to 2006, reflecting continued demand from new and existing customers for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics and other offerings. Software revenue of $39.5 million increased $3.2 million from $36.3 million in 2006 primarily from additional license and maintenance fees for credit decisioning and analysis products. Revenue from consulting services grew $4.6 million due to increased demand for credit education, risk modeling and scorecard development among customers seeking to implement sophisticated risk management processes and comply with regulatory requirements. Operating and SG&A expenses in 2007 including allocated corporate overhead costs were $275.7 million, an increase of $43.1 million from 2006. The increase is a primarily a result of additional compensation due to head count growth of 8% and higher sales commission expense resulting from better than expected revenue growth over 2006. It also reflected an increase in allocated expenses due to increased rent and occupancy costs related to the Companys relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and increases in professional service costs primarily due to information technology investment spending and legal matters. MAs operating income of $175.8 million in 2007 increased $33.3 million from $142.5 million in 2006. Operating income included an $8.7 million restructuring charge in 2007. Excluding the restructuring charge, 2007 operating income of $184.5 million increased $42.0 million, or 29.5%, from $142.5 million in 2006. Market Risk Moodys maintains operations in 30 countries outside the U.S. In 2008, approximately 42% and 47% of the Companys revenue billed and expenses incurred, respectively, were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the GBP and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 34% of Moodys assets were located outside the United States. Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $245.9 million at December 31, 2008, consisted of approximately $152 million, which was located outside the U.S., making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. Additionally, all of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $7.1 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the statement of shareholders equity (deficit). Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high quality investment grade corporate bonds in Korea. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 41 Table of Contents A portion of the Companys future billings and related revenue is exposed to market risk associated with changes in FX rates primarily related to the euro and GBP. Under the Companys current FX hedging program, the Company hedges a portion of FX currency risk for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows related to future euro and GBP billings and related revenue. FX options and forwards are currently utilized to hedge these exposures and have maturities between one and 14 months. As of December 2008 all FX derivative contracts were set to expire at various times through February 2010 and were deemed to be highly effective under SFAS No. 133 and related accounting pronouncements. No credit losses are anticipated as the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. The fair value of the Companys outstanding FX derivative contracts was recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consisted of the following notional amounts: December 31, 2008 2007 Notional amount of Currency Pair: GBP/USD &pound; 7.4 million &pound; 7.9 million EUR/USD 12.9 million 16.7 million EUR/GBP 24.3 million 61.5 million Fair value of derivative asset $ 4.9 million $ 2.3 million Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and, once realized, the gains or losses will be recognized as an adjustment to revenue when the billings are recognized in revenue. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the FX rates on Moodys FX options. A hypothetical 10% favorable change in the overall option currency portfolio would result in a gain of approximately $3.5 million as of December 31, 2008. The maximum loss related to an adverse change in the option currency portfolio would be $3.1 million. As a result of the 2008 Term Loan completed on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR based variable interest rate. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded into AOCI, while net interest payments are recorded in the statement of operations. At December 31, 2008 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $10.7 million and is recorded in other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moodys uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the short term LIBOR on Moodys interest expense relating to the 2008 Term Loan, assuming the interest rate swap was not in place. A hypothetical change of one percent in the LIBOR would result in an impact on annual interest expense of approximately $1.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations and from financing activities. The Company had net borrowings of $316.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Future Cash Requirements The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources. The Company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity, by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions in related business, repurchasing stock and paying a modest dividend. As a result of current market conditions, in the near term Moodys will maintain its dividend and curtail share repurchase activity. As of December 31, 2008 Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program, which does not have an established expiration. At December 31, 2008 the Company had total borrowings from its CP Program and 2007 Facility of $104.7 million and $613.0 million, respectively, the proceeds of which were or will be used to support the build out of 7WTC and Canary Wharf, share repurchases, acquisitions and other operational and investing activities. At December 31, 2008, Moodys had $1.5 billion of outstanding debt with $300 million of additional debt capacity available. On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moodys new headquarters. The 7WTC Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the 7WTC Lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. On March 28, 2007, the 7WTC lease agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square feet at 7WTC. The additional base rent is approximately $106 million over a 20 year term. The total remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2008, including the aforementioned rent credits, are approximately $612 million. On October 24, 2007, the Company announced a restructuring plan that would reduce global head count, terminate certain technology contracts and consolidate certain corporate functions in response to both the Companys Reorganization announced on August 7, 2007 as well as a decline in current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors. Included in the $50.0 million restructuring charge reported in 2007 is $7.0 million of non cash settlements relating to pension curtailments and stock based compensation award modifications for certain terminated employees. At December 31, 2008, the remaining cash payments were $11.4 million of which $3.3 million is expected to be paid during 2009. The remaining liability of $8.1 million relates to payments that will be made in connection with the Companys unfunded pension plans for which payments will commence when the affected employees reach retirement age beginning in 2009 and continue in accordance with plan provisions. The amount to be paid in 2009 relating to these pension liabilities is approximately $2 million. On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the Canary Wharf section of London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5 year term is approximately 134 million GBPs, and the Company will begin making base rent payments in 2011. In addition to the base rent payments the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligation. The Company expects to incur approximately 41 million GBP of costs to build out the floors to its specifications of which, approximately 33 million GBP is expected to be incurred over the next twelve months. The Company will be required to make a contribution in the later half of 2010 to its qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan of between approximately $10 million to $15 million. The contribution will be dependent on the 2009 plan asset returns as well as the actuarial determination of plan liabilities. MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 45 Table of Contents The Company also intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 16, 2008, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2009. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the Legacy Tax Matters that are discussed in this MD&A under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness The following table summarizes total indebtedness: DECEMBER 31, 2008 2007 2007 Facility $ 613.0 $ Commercial paper, net of unamortized discount of $0.3 million at 2008 and $0.7 million at 2007 104.7 551.9 Notes payable: Series 2005 1 Notes 300.0 300.0 Series 2007 1 Notes 300.0 300.0 2008 Term Loan 150.0 Total Debt 1,467.7 1,151.9 Current portion (717.7 ) (551.9 ) Total long term debt $ 750.0 $ 600.0 2007 Facility On September 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. The 2007 Facility will serve, in part, to support the Companys CP Program described below. Interest on borrowings is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the outstanding borrowing amount depending on the Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points of the facility amount, depending on the Companys Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 5.0 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2008 was 1.47%. The 2007 Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The 2007 Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Commercial Paper On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re borrowed. The CP Program is supported by the Companys 2007 Facility. The maturities of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The weighted average interest rate on CP borrowings outstanding was 2.08% and 5.13% as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The CP Program contains certain events of 46 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents default including, among other things: non payment of principal, interest or fees; violation of covenants; invalidity of any loan document; material judgments; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. Notes Payable On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007 1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007 1 Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi annually on March 7 and September 7 of each year. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007 1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create liens, enter into any sale leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005 1 Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005 1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% senior notes which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all, or part, of the Series 2005 1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005 1 Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. 2008 Term Loan On May 7, 2008, Moodys entered into a five year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan is payable quarterly at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 125 basis points to 175 basis points depending on the Companys Debt/EBITDA ratio. The outstanding borrowings shall amortize beginning in 2010 in accordance with the schedule of payments set forth in the 2008 Term Loan outlined in the table below. The 2008 Term Loan contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company to engage, or to permit its subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also limits the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The principal payments due on the 2008 Term Loan through its maturity are as follows: Year ending December 31, 2010 $ 3.8 2011 11.3 2012 71.2 2013 63.7 Total $ 150.0 Also on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR based variable interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan. Fair market value adjustments are recorded into other comprehensive income at the end of each period, while net interest payments are recorded in the statement of operations. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the interest rate swap was $10.7 million and is recorded in other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 47 Table of Contents Interest (expense) income, net The following table summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 2007 2006 Income $ 18.1 $ 19.3 $ 18.2 Expense on borrowings (60.0 ) (40.7 ) (15.2 ) FIN 48 and other tax related interest (13.7 ) (21.5 ) Reversal of accrued interest (a) 2.3 17.5 Interest capitalized 1.1 1.1 Total $ (52.2 ) $ (24.3 ) $ 3.0 Interest paid $ 59.5 $ 32.5 $ 14.9 (a) Represents a reduction of accrued interest related to the favorable resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the covenants described above, the 2007 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement and the 2008 Term Loan contain cross default provisions whereby default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Indebtedness (1) $ 1,761.9 $ 757.8 $ 94.2 $ 207.3 $ 702.6 Operating lease obligations 929.2 60.3 101.2 100.7 667.0 Purchase obligations (2) 139.8 71.1 42.0 23.8 2.9 Pension obligations (3) 71.2 1.7 16.2 7.1 46.2 Capital lease obligations 2.7 1.4 1.3 Total (4) $ 2,904.8 $ 892.3 $ 254.9 $ 338.9 $ 1,418.7 (1) Reflects principal payments, related interest and applicable fees due on the 2008 Term Loan, the Series 2005 1 Notes, the Series 2007 1 Notes, borrowings under the CP Program and the 2007 Facility, as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Includes amounts contractually committed to for the fit out of the Canary Wharf Lease. (3) Reflects projected benefit payments for the next ten years relating to the Companys unfunded Post Retirement Benefit Plans described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) The table above does not include the Companys net long term tax liabilities of $141.7 million and $51.5 million relating to FIN 48 and Legacy Tax Matters, respectively, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably estimated. 48 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents 2009 Outlook Moodys outlook for 2009 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the impact of government sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company expects full year 2009 revenue to decline in the low single digit percent range. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation in 2009 at current rates. Although Moodys has a solid base of recurring revenue, the Company anticipates issuance based revenue to reflect generally weak conditions throughout 2009, with any broad improvement in market liquidity and issuance expected to be modest and to occur later in the year. Full year 2009 operating expenses are expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range. Moodys expects the full year 2009 operating margin will be in the mid to high thirties percent range, due to lower ratings revenue and higher comparable expenses. The Company projects diluted EPS for full year 2009 in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. For the global MIS business, the Company expects revenue for the full year 2009 to decline in the high single digit percent range, both in the U.S. and internationally. Structured finance revenue for full year 2009 is expected to decrease in the high teens to low twenties percent range, reflecting continued declines across all asset classes. Corporate finance revenue for full year 2009 is expected to decrease in the mid to high single digit percent range, with weakness most pronounced in speculative grade issuance and bank loans. Revenue from financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance ratings for full year 2009 is expected to be about flat with full year 2008. For MA, the Company expects full year 2009 revenue growth in the mid single digit percent range. Moodys expects strong revenue growth in the software and consulting businesses to offset a revenue decline in the subscription business in the low single digit percent range. Within the U.S., the Company projects MA revenue to be about flat with full year 2008. Outside the U.S. the Company expects MA revenue to increase in the low double digit percent range. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted: In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS No. 159, a company may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. Items eligible for fair value election include recognized financial assets and liabilities such as equity method investments and investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, written loan commitments, and certain warranties and insurance contracts where a warrantor or insurer is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, the election must be applied to individual instruments with certain restrictions, is irrevocable and must be applied to an entire instrument. Any upfront costs and fees related to the item elected for fair value must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred. At the implementation date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the implementation of SFAS No. 159, changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and was implemented by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The implementation did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3 (FSP 157 3), Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP 157 3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP 157 3 is effective upon issuance and the implementation did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Not Yet Adopted: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 49 Table of Contents measurements that are already required or permitted to be measured at fair value by other accounting standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2), which partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for non financial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company has implemented the deferral provisions of FSP FAS 157 2 and as a result has partially implemented the provisions of SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008. The partial implementation of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations in 2008. The Company will apply, as of January 1, 2009, the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to its non financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination and not subsequently remeasured at fair value, non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value for a goodwill impairment assessment, non financial long lived assets measured at fair value for an asset impairment assessment, and asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. The Company does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained non controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners and requires that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is required to be implemented by the Company as of January 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard will have an immaterial impact on the presentation of minority interest in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141R extends its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non controlling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also expands disclosure requirements to improve the statement users abilities to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is required to be implemented by the Company as of January 1, 2009. While SFAS No. 141R applies only to business combinations consummated on or after its effective date, its amendments to SFAS No. 109 with respect to deferred tax valuation allowances and liabilities for income tax uncertainties are required to be applied to all deferred tax valuation allowances and liabilities for income tax uncertainties that existed and recognized in prior business combinations or that arise as a result of the prior business combinations. The implementation of SFAS No.141R is not expected to impact the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, and requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures in tabular format about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company plans to implement the provisions of SFAS No. 161 as of January 1, 2009 and does not expect the implementation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with. SFAS No. 162 will become effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company does not expect the implementation of SFAS No. 162 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 08 6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations (EITF 08 6). EITF 08 6 applies to all investments accounted for under the equity method and clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving those investments. EITF 08 6 is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2009. The implementation of EITF 08 6 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 50 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132R 1). FSP FAS 132R 1 expands the disclosures set forth in SFAS No. 132R by adding required disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made by management, major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk. Additionally, FSP FAS 132R 1 requires an employer to disclose information about the valuation of plan assets similar to that required under SFAS No. 157. FSP FAS 132R 1 intends to enhance the transparency surrounding the types of assets and associated risks in an employers defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan and the new disclosures are required to be included in financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the implementation of FSP FAS 132R 1 on its consolidated financial statements. Contingencies From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate. As a result of recent events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly, various legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are investigating or evaluating the role of rating agencies in the U.S. subprime mortgage backed securitization market and structured finance markets more generally. Moodys has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is cooperating with such investigations and inquiries. Moodys is also cooperating with a review by the SEC relating to errors in the model used by MIS to rate certain constant proportion debt obligations. In addition, the Company is facing market participant litigation relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moodys in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment. On June 27, 2008, the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants oversight of MISs ratings of RMBS and constant proportion debt obligations, and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about MISs ratings practices and or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief. On July 2, 2008, Thomas R. Flynn, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief. The cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in November 2008. The Company removed the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2008. In January 2009, the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The Company will oppose remand and expects to move to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint upon resolution of the remand motion. On October 30, 2008, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. This complaint too asserts various causes of action relating to the Companys ratings of RMBS, CDO and constant proportion debt obligations, and named defendants participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about MISs ratings practices and or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. On December 9, 2008, Rena Nadoff, a purported shareholder of the company, filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and its CEO, and the company as a nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged overrating of asset backed securities and underrating of municipal securities. Two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the Companys securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions have been consolidated MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS 51 Table of Contents into a single proceeding entitled In re Moodys Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Companys securities during the period February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and or misleading statements concerning the Companys business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MISs ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims, sustaining others and granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint by March 18, 2009. For claims, litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of FIN 48 implemented as of January 1, 2007 which requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. The Company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative, regulatory, enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position, financial position or results of operations. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate monetary liability of the Company for the pending matters referred to above (other than the Legacy Tax Matters that are discussed below) is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, although it is possible that the effect could be material to the Companys consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Legacy Tax Matters Moodys continues to have exposure to certain Legacy Tax Matters. The following description of the relationships among Moodys, New D&B and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the Legacy Tax Matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into two separate public companies: Old D&B and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. In September 2000, Old D&B separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Old D&B and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable IRS determinations on certain tax matters, and certain other potential tax liabilities, all as described in such agreements. Further, in connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to Legacy Tax Matters. Settlement agreements were executed with the IRS in 2005 regarding Legacy Tax Matters for the years 1989 1990 and 1993 1996. As of December 31, 2008, the Company continues to carry a liability of $1.8 million with respect to these matters. With respect to these settlement agreements, Moodys and New D&B believe that IMS Health and NMR did not pay their full share of the liability to the IRS pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties. Moodys and New D&B paid these amounts to the IRS on their behalf, and attempted to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR. As a result, Moodys and New D&B commenced arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR in connection with the 1989 1990 matter. This matter was resolved during the third quarter of 2008 in favor of Moodys and New D&B, resulting in IMS Health and NMR having paid a total of $6.7 million to Moodys. Moodys and New D&B may also commence an arbitration proceeding to collect amounts owed by IMS Health and NMR with respect to the 1993 1996 matter. Moodys cannot predict the outcome of this matter with any certainty. 52 MOODYS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS Table of Contents Amortization Expense Deductions This Legacy Tax Matter, which was affected by developments in June 2007 and 2008 as further described below, involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. IRS audits of Old D&Bs and New D&Bs tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in June 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions, or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction. These audits resulted in the IRS issuing the Notices for other tax issues for the 1997 2000 years aggregating $9.5 million in tax and penalties, plus statutory interest of approximately $6 million, which should be apportioned among Moodys, New D&B, IMS Health and NMR pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements. Moodys share of this assessment was $6.6 million including interest, net of tax. In November 2007, the IRS assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment, together with interest. The Company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the IRSs actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts. The absence of any tax deficiencies in the Notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2002, combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002, for issues not assessed, resulted in Moodys recording an earnings benefit of $52.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. This is comprised of two components, as follows: (i) a reversal of a tax liability of $27.3 million related to the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date, reducing the provision for income taxes; and (ii) a reduction of accrued interest expense of $17.5 million ($10.6 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non operating income of $14.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B. In June 2008, the statute of limitations for New D&B relating to the 2003 tax year expired. As a result, in the second quarter of 2008, Moodys recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of $2.3 million ($1.4 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non operating income of $6.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B. On the Distribution Date, New D&B paid Moodys $55.0 million for 50% of certain anticipated future tax benefits of New D&B through 2012. It is possible that IRS audits of New D&B for tax years after 2003 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction. In the event these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by New D&B, or there is an audit adjustment, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that New D&B incurs. As of December 31, 2008, Moodys liability with respect to this matter totaled $48.7 million. In March 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. In July 2007, New D&B and Moodys commenced procedures to recover approximately $57 million of these deposits ($24.6 million for New D&B and $31.9 million for Moodys), which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the Notices. As noted above, in November 2007 the IRS used $7.9 million of Moodys portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008 the IRS returned to Moodys $33.1 million in connection with this matter, which includes $3.0 million of interest. In July 2008, the IRS paid Moodys the remaining $1.8 million balance of the original deposit, and in September 2008 the IRS paid Moodys $0.2 million of interest on that balance. At December 31, 2008, Moodys has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $51.5 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000 Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows.
