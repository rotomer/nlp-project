MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This MD&A contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 54 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. THE COMPANY Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) risk management software and (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions and training services. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes investor oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events. The RD&A business also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its RMS business, MA provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software solutions. Within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions and training services. Beginning in January 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines were realigned. All of Moodys other non rating commercial activities are represented in the MA segment. As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business. In 2008 within MA, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and professional services businesses. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products; and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis. Subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12 month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual periods. In 2009, the aforementioned MA businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the MA segment at December 31, 2009. Pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed Research Data and Analytics and the software business was renamed Risk Management Software. The revised groupings classify certain subscription based risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined RMS business. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring liabilities, pension and other post retirement benefits, UTBs and stock based compensation. Actual MOODYS 2009 10 K 27 Table of Contents results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, MIS uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where MIS does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, MIS defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, deferred revenue included approximately $45 million, $48 million and $54 million, respectively, related to such monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods, ranging from three to 51 years, which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $78 million, $82 million and $86 million, respectively. MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, accounts receivable included approximately $27 million, $34 million and $38 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Revenue earned within the MA segment is recognized as follows: subscription based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial 12 month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods, beginning upon delivery of the initial product; software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs; professional service revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed. Certain revenue arrangements within the MA segment include multiple elements such as software licenses, maintenance, subscription fees and professional services. In these types of arrangements, the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value; that is, generally the price charged when sold separately or vendor specific objective evidence. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moodys adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates. Each quarter, the Company revises its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this MD&A, commencing on page 51 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where 28 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities. Based on its review of the latest information available, and subject to the contingencies described in Item 7. MD&A Contingencies, the ultimate monetary liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated financial position, although it is possible that the effect could be material to the Companys consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $4.3 million, $8.7 million and $27.3 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys liabilities for Legacy Tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are more fully described under the caption Legacy Tax Matters within Item 7, MD&A. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, annually as of November 30th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350. These impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. During 2009 there was a change in the reporting unit structure of MA to reflect the realignment under which the MA segment is currently managed. Accordingly, it was determined that MA had three reporting units within its segment: RD&A; RMS and training. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The RMS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance. The training reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training. As such, at the date of the impairment test, the Company had four primary reporting units: MIS, which encompasses the Companys ratings operations and the aforementioned three reporting units within MA. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level by ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other". In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived acquired intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate market comparables. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units. As a result of the reporting structure realignment in the MA segment described above, the company reassigned the assets and liabilities of the MA segment to each of its reporting units. Goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach; other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units. Based on the result of the above test, the Company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing Step 1 of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value. MOODYS 2009 10 K 29 Table of Contents The following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of November 30, 2009: Step One Sensitivity Analysis Deficit Caused by a Hypothetical Reduction to Fair Value Goodwill 10% 15% 20% 25% MIS $ 11.6 $ $ $ $ RD&A 158.7 RMS 165.2 (5.3 ) Training 18.5 Totals $ 354.0 $ $ $ $ (5.3 ) The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. The results of the DCF are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the DCF fair values. The DCF analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value, including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Moodys allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments. The following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment: WACC The WACC is the rate to discount each reporting units estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting units cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Companys outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 10% to 12% in 2009. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is due primarily to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units. An increase in the WACC of 1% for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350. Future cash flow assumptions The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. Cash flows for each of the next five years beginning in 2010 were estimated based on annual revenue growth rates ranging from 1% to 16%. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets which began in the second half of 2009. Beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units. A decrease in the growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculation of 10% for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350. However, there is a greater probability of potential goodwill impairment in the RMS and training reporting units if estimated growth rates are not met due to the lower percentage by which the fair value of these reporting units exceeds the carrying value. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The difficult market and economic conditions in 2009 resulted in lower than anticipated revenue for the RMS and training reporting units compared to forecasted results causing the Company to test the intangible assets within these reporting units for impairment at November 30, 2009. This test was performed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group that contained the aforementioned intangible assets to the carrying amount of the asset group. The undiscounted cash flows were sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset group and resulted in an excess of 39% and 48% for the RMS and training reporting units, respectively. 30 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Restructuring The Company has engaged in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs, contract termination costs and asset impairments. If the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted. For both the 2007 Restructuring Plan and the 2009 Restructuring Plan, there have not been any significant differences between original estimates and actual amounts recorded upon completion of both plans. For a full description of Moodys restructuring actions, refer to the Results of Operations section below and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moodys reports for its pension and other post retirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2009 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys Post Retirement Plans. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. The Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding gain or loss over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning of year projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. For Moodys Post Retirement Plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2009 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $55.0 million, and Moodys expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of $3.3 million in 2010 for the amortization of actuarial losses. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has an unrecognized asset loss of $20.7 million, of which $6.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2011 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2010 operating income. These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2010 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moodys Post Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2010 Estimated Impact on2010 Operating Income(Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.95% / 5.75% $ (6.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.5 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.3 ) * Discount rates of 5.95% and 5.75% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2010 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to Post Retirement Plans will be $21.6 million in 2010 compared with $14.5 million in 2009. The expected expense increase in 2010 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to assumption changes, such as higher cash balance interest crediting rate and lower discount rates, as well as higher amortization of actuarial losses. MOODYS 2009 10 K 31 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation The Company records compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2009 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used for2004 2009 grants Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact onOperating Income in 2009Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 0.1% 2% 0.10% $ 0.7 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 23% 43.7% 5% $ (3.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (3.1 ) Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Companys tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter company transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. Moodys is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve Legacy Tax and other tax matters. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTPs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non operating expenses. For UTPs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTPs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Companys operating results or financial condition. For certain of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the Company which may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moodys. 32 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents OPERATING SEGMENTS Beginning in January 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moodys other non rating commercial activities are represented in the MA segment. As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business. The MIS segment now consists of four lines of business structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. As part of the Reorganization, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and professional services businesses within MA. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial 12 month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual periods; the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products; and the professional services business included credit training associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis. In 2009, the aforementioned MA businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the MA segment at December 31, 2009. Pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed Research, Data and Analytics and the software business was renamed Risk Management Software. The revised groupings classify license software sales, certain subscription based risk management software revenue, maintenance and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined RMS business. The following tables are reconciliations of the revenue groupings previously disclosed to the new groupings for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Revenue reported as per filings in prior years: 2008 2007 Subscriptions $ 475.9 $ 421.5 Software 49.2 39.5 Professional Services 25.6 18.1 Total MA $ 550.7 $ 479.1 Year Ended December 31, Reclass for 2009 realignment: 2008 2007 Subscriptions $ (57.2 ) $ (51.2 ) Software 59.6 52.9 Professional Services (2.4 ) (1.7 ) Total MA $ $ Year Ended December 31, 2009 revenue reported: 2008 2007 RD&A $ 418.7 $ 370.3 RMS 108.8 92.4 Professional Services 23.2 16.4 Total MA $ 550.7 $ 479.1 MOODYS 2009 10 K 33 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments, excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company are allocated to each segment based on a revenue split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resource, information technology and legal. In addition to its reported results, Moodys has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as non GAAP financial measures. Management believes that such non GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Companys performance. These non GAAP financial measures relate to Legacy Tax Matters and expenses and adjustments made to both the Companys 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans, further described in Note 17 and Note 10, respectively, to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 Executive summary Moodys revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $1,797.2 million, an increase of $41.8 million from 2008. Excluding the negative impact from changes in FX translation rates, revenue in 2009 increased $76.6 million compared to the same period in 2008. Total expenses for 2009 were $1,109.7 million, an increase of $102.5 million from 2008, and included approximately $32 million in favorable changes from FX translation rates. Operating income of $687.5 million in 2009 decreased $60.7 million compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of restructuring in both years, operating income was $705.0 million, a decrease of $40.7 million from the prior year. Diluted EPS of $1.69 in 2009 included a $0.05 unfavorable impact from restructuring actions and a $0.04 favorable impact relating to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter. Excluding the aforementioned items in 2009, diluted EPS of $1.70 decreased $0.12, or 7%, from $1.82 in 2008, which excludes the prior year favorable per share impacts of $0.01 and $0.04 for restructuring and the resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, respectively.

The MIS growth is reflective of gradual improvement in the credit markets throughout 2009 which resulted in increased issuance volumes for fundamental ratings, particularly for investment grade and high yield corporate debt, partially offset by continued declines in structured finance issuance. The MA growth is primarily due to higher international RMS revenue which resulted from the Fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the negative impact from changes in FX translation rates, Moodys revenue in 2009 increased $76.6 million compared to 2008. Transaction revenue accounted for 37% of global MCO revenue in 2009 compared to 36% in the prior year. Transaction revenue in the MIS segment represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other one time fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation and or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes and shelf registrations. In the MA segment, relationship revenue represents subscription based revenues and software maintenance revenue. Transaction revenue in MA represents software license fees and revenue from the professional services line of business which offers credit risk management advisory and training services, which are typically sold on a per engagement basis. In the U.S., revenue increased $10.7 million with modest growth in MIS being partially offset by declines in MA. The increase in ratings revenue primarily reflects the aforementioned recovery in the investment grade and high yield corporate bond markets partially offset by declines in structured finance ratings. Revenue declined for all LOBs within MA. International revenue of $876.4 million for 2009 was $31.1 million higher than 2008 and reflected growth in investment grade and high yield rated issuance within CFG as well as MA revenue which benefited from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. These increases were partially offset by significant declines in SFG revenue within MIS as well as approximately $35 million in unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. Total expenses for 2009 were $1,109.7 million, an increase of $102.5 million from 2008. The increase primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008, costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan and higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Additionally, there were higher rent and occupancy costs in 2009 related to the Canary Wharf lease in London, higher professional services costs which include legal and IT consulting as well as a charge for an international VAT matter. The aforementioned increases were partially offset by an approximate $32 million favorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. Operating expenses were $532.4 million, an increase of $39.1 million from the prior year, resulting primarily from higher compensation costs of approximately $28 million compared to the same period in 2008. Compensation costs were $445.1 million, an increase of 7% from prior year, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Non compensation expenses in 2009 were $87.3 million, an increase of approximately $11 million compared to the same period in 2008. The increase is due to higher professional service costs which include technology consulting costs associated with an investment in IT infrastructure. The increase in both compensation and non compensation expenses were partially offset by favorable changes in FX translation rates. SG&A expenses of $495.7 million were $54.4 million higher than prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher non compensation costs, which reflect higher rent expense relating to the Canary Wharf lease in London, additional bad debt expense due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions, higher professional services costs which include consulting as well as higher costs associated with investment in technology infrastructure. Compensation costs of $250.1 million increased 7% over the same period in 2008 primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Restructuring expenses of $17.5 million in 2009 reflect costs associated with headcount reductions, the divestiture of non strategic assets and contract terminations in accordance with the 2009 Restructuring Plan, as well as adjustments to previous estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan. The restructuring benefit of $2.5 million in 2008 reflects adjustments to previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring Plan. MOODYS 2009 10 K 35 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization of $64.1 million decreased $11.0 million from 2008 primarily due to the following items in 2008: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of Fermat and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Companys New Jersey office. The absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income of $687.5 million decreased $60.7 million from prior year reflecting the 10% increase in operating expenses being partially offset by modest revenue increases. Excluding the impact of restructuring in both years, operating income of $705.0 million decreased $40.7 million. Changes in FX translation rates had a $3 million unfavorable impact on operating income in 2009. Interest (expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 was ($33.4) million, a decrease of $18.8 million compared to the same period in 2008. The change is due primarily to an interest expense reduction of approximately $12 million for tax and tax related liabilities recorded in the first quarter of 2009 coupled with a $6.5 million favorable resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2009. Interest expense on borrowings decreased approximately $15 million compared to 2008 reflecting lower short term debt balances coupled with lower interest rates on borrowings under the 2007 Facility and CP Program. During 2009, the Company has utilized its operating cash flow to reduce short term borrowings by 38%. Additionally, interest income decreased approximately $16 million compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting lower interest rate yields on cash and cash equivalents balances. Other non operating income (expense), net in 2009 was $(7.9) million compared to $33.8 million in 2008. The change reflects FX losses of $9.5 million in 2009 compared to FX gains of $24.7 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the weakening of the euro to the British pound in 2009 relating to accounts receivable denominated in non functional currencies as well as $11 million in favorable adjustments for Legacy Tax Matters in 2008. Moodys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 37.0%, or 30 bps higher than the prior year. Excluding Legacy Tax Matters in both years, the ETR in 2009 of 37.6% increased 50 bps from 2008. Net Income in 2009 was $402.0 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, and decreased $55.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of restructuring and Legacy Tax Matters in both years, Net Income in 2009 decreased $40.6 million to $404.7 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, from $1.82 in the same period of 2008. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further analysis and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Revenue: Structured finance $ 304.9 $ 404.7 (24.7 )% Corporate finance 408.2 307.0 33.0 % Financial institutions 258.5 263.0 (1.7 )% Public, project and infrastructure finance 246.1 230.0 7.0 % Total 1,217.7 1,204.7 1.1 % Expenses: Operating and SG&A 680.1 636.0 6.9 % Restructuring 9.1 (1.6 ) NM Depreciation and amortization 31.3 33.3 (6.0 )% Total 720.5 667.7 7.9 % Operating income $ 497.2 $ 537.0 (7.4 )% Global MIS revenue in 2009 of $1,217.7 million increased $13.0 million, or $35.9 million excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, compared to 2008. The increase from prior year reflects growth in rated issuance in the investment grade and high yield sectors of CFG coupled with increases in public and infrastructure ratings revenue within PPIF. These increases were partially offset by declines in new issuance in SFG and FIG. Transaction revenue for total MIS in 2009 was 50% compared to 49% in 2008. In the U.S., revenue was $663.1 million, an increase of $18.1 million or 3% from prior year reflecting strong growth in ratings of investment and speculative grade corporate debt partially offset by new issuance declines which were significant in SFG and modest 36 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents in FIG. Non U.S. revenue was $554.6 million and decreased 1% from the same period in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects declines in all international regions within SFG partially offset by growth in CFG and PPIF in EMEA due to higher issuance volumes. Global SFG revenue of $304.9 million decreased $99.8 million reflecting the continued slowdown of new issuance in the securitization markets due to reduced investor appetite, continued high interest rate spreads and higher credit enhancements. The continued decline in new issuance resulted in transaction revenue in 2009 representing 41% of total SFG revenue, compared to 50% in 2008. In the U.S., revenue of $142.1 million decreased $42.1 million with the most prevalent declines in the Derivatives, ABS and CMBS sectors. Non U.S. revenue was $162.8 million and declined $57.7 million from 2008, with 41% of the decrease occurring within EMEA Derivatives. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had a $7 million impact on international SFG revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. Global CFG revenue of $408.2 million increased $101.2 million from the prior year which included approximately $6 million of unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. The global increase is due primarily to higher rated issuance in the investment grade and high yield sectors. Transaction revenue represented 64% of total CFG revenue, an increase from 54% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue was $251.2 million, an increase of $68.1 million compared to 2008, reflecting strong growth in both investment grade and high yield bond issuance. U.S. revenue accounted for 62% of global CFG compared to 60% in the prior year period. The growth in investment grade rated issuance reflects an increase in the number of companies refinancing debt ahead of expected maturities to take advantage of favorable interest rates within the corporate finance markets and to improve liquidity. The activity in the U.S. high yield markets increased revenue by approximately $45 million, with 68% of the growth occurring in the second half of 2009. The growth in speculative grade rated issuance reflects increased investor confidence in the high yield market and the continued narrowing of interest rate spreads compared to U.S. Treasuries which began in the second quarter of 2009. Internationally, revenue of $157.0 million in 2009 increased 27% compared to the same period in 2008, driven primarily by growth in investment grade issuance within EMEA and high yield issuance across all non U.S. regions, reflecting early debt refinancing activities. Global FIG revenue of $258.5 million declined $4.5 million from the prior year, with declines in the U.S. being partially offset by modest growth internationally. Transaction revenue declined to 31% of total FIG revenue, compared to 33% in the same period of 2008. In the U.S., 2009 revenue of $107.3 million decreased $10.5 million from 2008, primarily within specialty insurance which reflects continued contraction within the sector. Outside the U.S., revenue was $151.2 million, an increase of 4% from the prior year due primarily to growth in the banking sector in the Canada and Latin America regions. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates negatively impacted international FIG revenue by approximately $6 million. Global PPIF revenue was $246.1 million and increased $16.1 million compared to the same period in 2008 with increases in public finance and infrastructure finance being partially offset by declines in U.S. municipal structured products. Revenue generated from new transactions comprised 59% of global PPIF, unchanged from the same period of 2008. In the U.S., PPIF revenue increased $2.6 million compared to 2008 with growth in public finance reflecting higher issuance related to the Build America Bond Program which was implemented in the U.S. as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, coupled with higher project and infrastructure revenue. These increases were partially offset by declines in issuance for municipal structured products which reflects declines in bank capacity and a lower market penetration for insured transactions. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue increased $13.5 million, or 19% over 2008, reflecting growth in infrastructure finance and public finance revenue in EMEA partially offset by declines in project finance in Asia. Excluding the $4 million unfavorable impact of changes in FX translation rates, international revenue grew $17.7 million compared to the same period in 2008. Operating and SG&A expenses in 2009 increased $44.1 million, reflecting increases in compensation and non compensation costs of approximately $26 million and $18 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs compared to 2008 related to higher incentive compensation due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results being partially offset by cost savings realized from the 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans, $6 million of senior executive severance costs included in 2008 and the impact of favorable changes in FX translation rates. The increase in non compensation costs reflects higher rent and occupancy costs for the Canary Wharf Lease, higher professional services costs which include legal and IT consulting and a higher allowance for uncollectible accounts due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions. Additionally, there was a charge in 2009 for an international VAT matter. Restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan as well as adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization of $31.3 million decreased $2.0 million from the prior year and was primarily due to the 2008 accelerated depreciation for the New Jersey office facility closure being partially offset by higher depreciation relating to costs capitalized for ongoing IT systems projects which were placed in service during 2009. MOODYS 2009 10 K 37 Table of Contents Operating income of $497.2 million was $39.8 million lower than 2008 primarily reflecting the 8% increase in total expenses.

Recurring revenue comprised 89% of total revenue in 2009, slightly lower than the 91% in 2008 reflecting higher RMS license and service revenue which is primarily transaction based. In the U.S., revenue of $257.7 million decreased 3%, reflecting declines across all LOBs. International revenue of $321.8 million was $36.2 million higher than in 2008, primarily reflecting strong growth in RMS resulting from the Fermat acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008. Global RD&A revenue, which comprises 71% of total MA in 2009, was down slightly compared to 2008 reflecting modestly higher attrition due to contraction among capital markets customers offset by demand for products that support analysis for investment and commercial credit applications. U.S. revenue was $212.5 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from 2008. Internationally, revenue totaled $201.1 million, a decrease of $1.4 million from the prior year. Global RMS revenue increased $36.3 million compared to 2008, and was primarily due to the Fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $42.1 million was down $1.7 million compared prior year, while international revenue of $103.0 million increased $38.0 million reflecting the aforementioned acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Global professional services revenue decreased $2.4 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting declines in training services in the U.S. and EMEA as companies reduced their spending on these services due to the poor capital markets and economic conditions during 2009. Operating and SG&A expenses of $348.0 million increased $49.4 million from the prior year, reflecting higher compensation and non compensation costs. Compensation costs of $229.1 million increased $18.2 million from the prior year and reflected additional headcount from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008 partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from lower achievement against 2009 targeted results. Non compensation expenses were $118.9 million, an increase of $31.2 million compared to 2008, primarily due to higher rent and occupancy costs for the Canary Wharf Lease and higher expenses related to acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. The aforementioned increases for both compensation and non compensation costs were partially offset by favorable changes in FX translation rates. Restructuring expenses of $8.4 million reflect severance and contract termination costs associated with the divestiture of non strategic assets as well as adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2009 and 2007 Restructuring Plans. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $9.0 million from prior year, primarily due to adjustments recorded in 2008 relating to an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of Fermat. The absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets during 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. 38 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Operating income of $190.3 million decreased $20.9 million compared to 2008, due to the 15% increase in expenses outpacing the 5% increase in revenue.

Diluted EPS of $1.87 for 2008 included a benefit of $0.05 related to the resolution of certain Legacy Tax Matters and minor adjustments to the 2007 restructuring. Excluding the Legacy Tax Matters and impact of restructuring in both years, diluted EPS of $1.82 for 2008 decreased 27% from $2.50 for 2007. Revenue at MIS totaled $1,204.7 million for 2008, a decrease of $575.2 million, or 32% from 2007. Excluding the positive impact from FX translation, revenue declined $591.7 million, or 33% from prior year. U.S. revenue of $645.0 million decreased $474.0 million or 42%, while non U.S. revenue of $559.7 million decreased $101.2 million or 15% from the prior year. The public, project and infrastructure business line achieved modest growth. Due to the credit market crisis that began in mid 2007 all other MIS business lines recorded declines from the prior year, led by structured finance. MA revenue rose to $550.7 million for 2008, up 15% from 2007 with all lines of business growing. U.S. revenue of $265.1 million for 2008 increased 9% from 2007.

Total relationship and transaction based revenue for Moodys in 2008 was 64% and 36%, respectively, compared to 45% and 55%, respectively in the prior year. MOODYS 2009 10 K 39 Table of Contents U.S. revenue was $910.1 million, down $451.7 million from the prior year primarily reflecting significantly reduced issuance activity due to the broader downturn in global economic activity, significant financial market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads. International revenue of $845.3 million decreased $51.9 million from 2007 and accounted for 48% of global revenue compared to 40% a year ago. FX translation contributed approximately $23 million to 2008 international revenue. Issuance volumes were significantly lower across most of the EMEA and Asian markets compared to 2007. Operating expenses were $493.3 million, down $90.7 million due primarily to lower compensation costs of $70.5 million. Incentive compensation of $30.8 million decreased $27.8 million due to weak financial performance within the MIS segment and the impact of restructuring. Salaries and wages decreased approximately $21 million primarily reflecting the effects of the 2007 restructuring. Stock based compensation of $40.6 million declined $17.3 million due to the impact of the 2007 restructuring which resulted in higher forfeitures of awards than in the previous year. Non compensation costs of $76.6 million decreased $20.2 million due to strong cost controls, particularly in the areas of T&E and recruiting which declined approximately $9 million and $3 million, respectively. SG&A expenses of $441.3 million decreased $9.8 million from the prior year due to declines in both compensation and non compensation expenses. Compensation costs decreased $4.9 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting reductions of approximately $5 million and $10 million in incentive and stock based compensation, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an approximate $9 million increase in salaries and wages due primarily to $6 million in senior executive severance expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Non compensation expenses of $207.4 million were down $4.9 million from prior year reflecting decreases in T&E, rent and occupancy costs, and professional service fees of $4.6 million, $5.4 million and $6.8 million, respectively, partially offset by approximately $11 million of bad debt reflecting the increase in bankruptcies and collection issues, compared to less than $1 million in 2007. The table below shows Moodys global staffing by geographic area: December 31, 2008* 2007 % Change United States 2,130 2,175 (2.1 )% International 1,817 1,397 30.1 % Total 3,947 3,572 10.5 % * reflects approximately 350 additional headcount due to acquisitions made during the year, of which approximately 290 were added in the fourth quarter. Restructuring in 2008 reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization of $75.1 million increased $32.2 million from 2007 primarily due to: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, approximately $6 million of incremental depreciation reflecting the use of 7WTC for the full year of 2008, approximately $6 million of purchase accounting amortization associated with the acquisition of Fermat of which $4.5 million was a write off of acquired in process technology and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Companys New Jersey office in the second quarter of 2008. Operating income in 2008 of $748.2 million decreased $382.8 million from the prior year reflecting the significant decline in revenue resulting in an operating margin of 42.6%, which was 750 basis points lower than the 50.1% margin in 2007. Operating income in 2007 reflected a $50.0 million restructuring charge. FX translation positively impacted operating income by approximately $28 million. Interest income (expense), net was ($52.2) million, an increase of $27.9 million from prior year primarily due to higher debt levels and the absence in 2008 of $17.5 million of income relating to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $2.3 million in 2008. Other non operating income (expense), net was $33.8 million, up $18.5 million from the prior year, due primarily to FX gains of approximately $25 million recorded during the year reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the euro to the British pound. Moodys effective tax rate of 36.7% remained essentially flat with 37.0% in 2007. Excluding the impact of restructuring and Legacy Tax items in both years, Moodys ETR was 37.1%, down 290 bps from 40.0% in 2007, due primarily to a larger portion of consolidated taxable income being generated from outside the U.S., which is generally taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rate, and the realization of benefits available for U.S. based manufacturing and research activities. 40 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Net Income was $457.6 million, a decrease of $243.9 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting revenue declines that outpaced cost reductions. Excluding the impact of Legacy Tax Matters and restructuring, net income of $445.3 million was $235.3 million lower than 2007. Diluted EPS was $1.87, or 28% lower than in the prior year resulting from the 35% reduction in net income, partially offset by 10% fewer diluted shares outstanding. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further analysis and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Revenue: Structured finance $ 404.7 $ 868.4 (53.4 )% Corporate finance 307.0 416.4 (26.3 )% Financial institutions 263.0 274.3 (4.1 )% Public, project and infrastructure finance 230.0 220.8 4.2 % Total 1,204.7 1,779.9 (32.3 )% Expenses: Operating and SG&A 636.0 759.4 (16.2 )% Restructuring (1.6 ) 41.3 (103.9 )% Depreciation and amortization 33.3 24.0 38.8 % Total $ 667.7 $ 824.7 (19.0 )% Operating income $ 537.0 $ 955.2 (43.8 )% Global MIS revenue of $1,204.7 million was down $575.2 million from 2007, reflecting the significant declines in global SFG and U.S. CFG revenue. In the U.S., revenue of $645.0 million was down $474.0 million, or 42%, due to decreases in SFG and CFG. Internationally, revenue was $559.7 million, a decline of $101.2 million, or 15%, from a year ago, with declines in SFG and CFG, partially offset by growth in PPIF. In 2008, international revenue comprised 46% of global revenue, compared to 37% in 2007. FX contributed approximately $16 million to international revenue in 2008. The split of revenue between relationship and transaction was 51% and 49%, respectively, versus the prior year when the split was 32% relationship and 68% transaction revenue. Globally, the lower proportion of transaction revenue in 2008 was primarily due to the significant decline in new issuance due to the broader downturn in global economic activity reflected in the extreme market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads in the later part of the year. Global SFG revenue decreased $463.7 million, due to declines in derivatives, CREF and RMBS of $196.0 million or 58%, $123.8 million or 69%, and $103.1 million or 58%, respectively, which together accounted for 91% of the decrease. Continued turbulence in the capital and credit markets, combined with lack of market liquidity and higher interest rate spreads, has resulted in lower loan origination and securitization which led to a significant decline in new issuance revenue. In 2008, transaction based revenue accounted for 50% of total SFG down from 77% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $184.2 million was down approximately $372 million or 67%, from a year ago, led by declines in the aforementioned asset classes due to significantly reduced issuance volume. International revenue was $220.5 million, a decrease of $91.4 million or 29% from 2007, led by declines in derivatives and CREF of $48.5 million or 42%, and $41.6 million or 66%, respectively. FX translation contributed approximately $8 million to international SFG revenue in 2008. Global CFG revenue was down $109.4 million from prior year, due to low issuance volumes particularly in the U.S. Revenue from new issuance declined 42% from the prior year, due primarily to lower issuance in both investment grade and speculative grade securities, resulting from the broader downturn in global economic activity, reflected in the significant financial market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads in the later part of the year. Transaction based revenue comprised 54% of global CFG revenue, compared to 69% in 2007. Revenue in the U.S. was $183.1 million, a decrease of $91.8 million, or 33%, from the prior year as revenue from bank loans and speculative grade bond ratings declined $64.1 million or 66% and $30.6 million or 62%, respectively, and was slightly offset by $6.6 million, or 18%, of growth in revenue from monitoring fees. International revenue of $123.9 million was down $17.6 million, or 12%, from prior year comprised of declines in speculative grade bond ratings, bank loan ratings, estimated ratings and investment grade bond ratings of $10.4 million or 56%, $7.4 million or 67%, $4.4 million or 25%, and $3.7 million or 13%, respectively. These declines were offset by growth in monitoring fees of $5.3 million, MOODYS 2009 10 K 41 Table of Contents as well as an approximate $2 million increase in other CFG services such as national scale ratings and company credit assessment services. FX translation contributed approximately $3 million to international CFG revenue in 2008. Global FIG revenue decreased $11.3 million from the prior year reflecting significant declines in issuance volumes primarily in the U.S. insurance and banking markets due to the on going credit crisis. Revenue from new transactions accounted for 33% of total FIG in 2008, compared to 42% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $117.8 million decreased $12.2 million, or 9%, from prior year, led by an $8.9 million decline in the insurance sector, specifically the property and casualty insurance industry which was down $5.0 million or 22% from 2007. International revenue of $145.2 million remained flat with prior year reflecting growth from the life insurance industry offset by declines from rating financial guarantors and the property and casualty insurance industry. FX translation contributed $5 million to international FIG revenue in 2008. Global PPIF revenue increased $9.2 million from prior year due to growth in municipal structured products and in the project and infrastructure finance sectors of $10.3 million or 35%, and $2.5 million or 3%, respectively. Recurring revenue represented 41% of total in 2008 compared with 40% in 2007. In the U.S., revenue of $159.9 million grew $2.3 million, with increases in the aforementioned municipal structured products partially offset by declines of $6.4 million in other public finance issuance. Outside the U.S., revenue of $70.1 million was up $6.9 million, or 11%, from prior year, reflecting growth primarily within the EMEA region of $4.6 million and $2.1 million in the infrastructure finance and public finance sectors, respectively. Operating and SG&A expenses of $636.0 million, including allocated corporate overhead costs, decreased $123.4 million, with declines in both compensation and non compensation expenses of approximately $83 million and approximately $40 million, respectively. Incentive compensation decreased approximately $39 million primarily due to weak financial performance. Stock based compensation decreased approximately $20 million primarily reflecting the impact of the 2007 Restructuring Plan which resulted in higher forfeitures of awards than in the previous year. Salary and benefits expense decreased approximately $24 million from prior year, reflecting the change in the mix of employees and timing of adding new hires during the year, partially offset by approximately $6 million in senior executive severance expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in non compensation expenses from 2007 reflected continued strong cost controls, resulting in reductions within T&E, recruiting and marketing of $14.6 million, $3.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Offsetting these decreases in 2008 was an $8.1 million increase in bad debt expense compared to prior year, primarily related to bankruptcies and collection issues, including $2.3 million for Lehman Brothers and $1.7 million for issuers of structured investment vehicles. The 2008 restructuring amount primarily reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.3 million primarily due to the accelerated depreciation recorded in the second quarter of 2008 relating to the Jersey City office closure and a full year of depreciation on 7WTC assets. Operating income decreased $418.2 million from 2007 reflecting the 32% reduction in revenue outpacing the 19% decline in Operating and SG&A expenses. Excluding the impact of the 2007 restructuring and minor adjustments made in 2008 relating to this charge, operating income declined $461.1 million or 46% from the prior year. FX translation had a positive impact of approximately $17 million on MIS operating income in 2008. Moodys Analytics The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Revenue: RD&A $ 418.7 $ 370.3 13.1 % RMS 108.8 92.4 17.7 % Professional services 23.2 16.4 41.5 % Total 550.7 479.1 14.9 % Expenses: Operating and SG&A 298.6 275.7 8.3 % Restructuring (0.9 ) 8.7 (110.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 41.8 18.9 121.2 % Total 339.5 303.3 11.9 % Operating income $ 211.2 $ 175.8 20.1 % 42 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Global MA revenue increased $71.6 million, with 69% of the growth generated internationally, and accounted for 31% of global MCO revenue in 2008 compared to 21% in the prior year. Recurring revenue, which includes subscription and software maintenance fees, comprised 91% of the total in 2008, Compared to 92% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $265.1 million increased 9%, primarily reflecting growth in RD&A revenue. International revenue of $285.6 million was $49.3 million higher than in 2007, reflecting growth in all business lines, particularly in RMS which benefited from the acquisition of Fermat. FX translation contributed approximately $7 million to international MA revenue in 2008. Global RD&A revenue, which comprises 76% of total MA in 2008, increased $48.4 million and accounted for 68% of global MA growth, reflecting continued demand from new and existing customers for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics, credit risk assessment and other offerings. U.S. revenue was $216.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million from 2007. Internationally, revenue totaled $202.5 million, an increase of $27.6 million or 16% over the prior year, with 80% of the growth generated within the EMEA region. Global RMS revenue increased $16.4 million, including the positive impact of the Fermat acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $43.8 million remained flat with prior year, while international revenue of $65.0 million increased $16.0 million or 33% from the prior year with growth generated from all regions. Global professional services revenue increased $6.8 million over prior year reflecting relatively higher demand internationally for credit education, portfolio analysis, risk modeling and scorecard development services, primarily in the EMEA region. Operating and SG&A expenses, including allocated corporate overhead costs, were $298.6, an increase of $22.9 million from the prior year due to increases in both compensation and non compensation expenses of approximately $8 million and approximately $15 million, respectively. The increase in compensation expense primarily reflects approximately $6 million of higher incentive compensation costs due to better than expected financial performance, and a 30% increase in average headcount due to acquisitions made during the year. Non compensation expenses of $98.0 million increased due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and a higher proportion of allocated corporate overhead expenses in 2008 compared to prior year based on the revenue split methodology, as well as the absence in 2008 of a $2.5 million sales tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2007. The 2008 restructuring amount primarily reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. The increase in depreciation and amortization of $22.9 million compared to 2007 is primarily due to the approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and amortization of approximately $6 million related to the Fermat acquisition, including a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology. Operating income increased $35.4 million from 2007, reflecting strong revenue growth and an approximate $10 million positive impact from FX translation. MARKET RISK Moodys maintains operations in 26 countries outside the U.S. In 2009, approximately 45% and 50% of the Companys revenue billed and expenses incurred, respectively, were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the GBP and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 45% of Moodys assets were located outside the United States. Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $473.9 million at December 31, 2009, consisted of approximately $404 million, which was located outside the U.S., making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. Additionally, all of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $10.0 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the statement of shareholders equity (deficit). Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high quality investment grade corporate bonds in Korea. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. A portion of the Companys future billings and related revenue is exposed to market risk associated with changes in FX rates primarily related to the euro and GBP. Under the Companys current FX hedging program, the Company hedges a portion of FX currency risk for MOODYS 2009 10 K 43 Table of Contents the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows related to future euro and GBP billings and related revenue. FX options and forwards are currently utilized to hedge these exposures and as of December 31, 2009 have maturities between one and 11 months. As of December 2009 all FX derivative contracts were deemed to be highly effective under Topic 815 of the ASC. No credit losses are anticipated as the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions and the Company adheres to strict guidelines regarding the creditworthiness of its counterparties. The fair value of the Companys outstanding FX derivative contracts was recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consisted of the following notional amounts: December 31, 2009 2008 Notional amount of Currency Pair: GBP/USD &pound; 5.0 &pound; 7.4 EUR/USD 9.9 12.9 EUR/GBP 21.0 24.3 Fair value of derivative asset $ 1.2 $ 4.9 Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and, once realized, the gains or losses will be recognized as an adjustment to revenue when the billings are recognized in revenue. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the FX rates on Moodys FX options. A hypothetical 10% favorable change in the overall option currency portfolio would result in a gain of approximately $2.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The maximum loss related to an adverse change in the option currency portfolio would be $2.4 million. As a result of the 2008 Term Loan completed on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR based variable interest rate. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded into AOCI, while net interest payments are recorded in the statement of operations. At December 31, 2009 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $7.6 million and is recorded in other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moodys uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the short term LIBOR on Moodys interest expense relating to the 2008 Term Loan, assuming the interest rate swap was not in place. A hypothetical change of one percent in the LIBOR would result in an impact on annual interest expense of approximately $1.5 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and from financing activities. The Company had net repayments on borrowings of $274.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.

These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. A $7.8 million non cash reduction related to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2008; 44 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents A $33.8 million increase in deferred income tax expense primarily relating to the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001 2007 tax years. The $104.1 million increase of net cash flows provided by operating activities resulted from changes in assets and liabilities discussed below and the change in the non cash items discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $54.5 million: A $168.8 million increase attributed to a reduction in 2009 payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflecting lower 2008 incentive compensation payouts made in the first quarter of 2009 due to weaker financial performance compared to targets in 2008 compared to 2007 as well as lower accrued taxes resulting primarily from the decrease in pre tax income; A $32.4 million increase relating to the $17.5 million restructuring charge taken in 2009, of which $5 million has not been paid, coupled with lower restructuring payments in 2009 compared to 2008 attributable to the 2007 Restructuring Plan; A $78.4 million increase due to a reduction in other current assets primarily due to a reduction in prepaid taxes which were used for 2009 estimated income tax payments; An increase in the growth of deferred rent of approximately $15 million due primarily to a free rent period associated with the Canary Wharf lease; Partially offset by: A $45.4 million decrease from other liabilities primarily reflecting a $17 million payment for interest to settle a tax audit for the 2001 2007 tax years and a $12 million reduction to accrued interest for UTBs; A decrease of approximately $33 million due to a refund of a deposit from the IRS in March 2008 in connection with a Legacy Tax Matter; A $51.8 million decrease in UTBs primarily related to a payment for the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001 2007 tax years; A $41.1 million decrease relating to 5% higher accounts receivable from December 31, 2008 reflecting higher billings related to the gradual improvement in the credit markets during 2009 compared to a 5% decrease in the December 31, 2008 balance compared to the prior year reflecting lower billings in the later part of 2008 compared to 2009. Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 The following changes in non cash and other one time items impacted cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007, relative to net income: A $27.0 million decrease in stock based compensation expense primarily reflecting the 2007 restructuring actions; A $32.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due primarily to an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangibles within the MA segment, approximately $6 million relating to the acquisition of Fermat including a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology, approximately $6 million reflecting the use of 7WTC for the full year of 2008 and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of the Companys New Jersey office in the second quarter of 2008; A $44.7 million decrease in Excess Tax Benefits due to fewer stock option exercises; A $44.5 million decrease of an accrual for Legacy Tax Matters in 2007 compared to 2008; A $59.1 million decrease in deferred income taxes due to lower restructuring, tenant allowances, and deferred revenue in 2008. The $448.5 million reduction of net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributed to a decrease in net income of $245.2 million, adjusted for the non cash and other one time items discussed above, and the following changes in assets and liabilities: A decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $172.3 million, comprised of approximately $111 million of accrued taxes relating to lower pre tax income and the timing of payments and approximately $30 million related to lower annual incentive compensation accruals reflecting weak financial performance; A decrease in deferred revenue of $70.2 million as a result of lower billings reflecting the weak credit market conditions; A decrease of $62.9 million in the restructuring liability relating to payments made during the year and other minor adjustments; A decrease in the growth of deferred rent of $46.5 million due primarily to a tenant allowance received in 2007 relating to 7WTC; MOODYS 2009 10 K 45 Table of Contents An increase of approximately $33 million for a deposit returned from the IRS in March 2008 in connection with a Legacy Tax Matter. A $61.1 million decrease in UTBs and other non current tax liabilities due primarily to the implementation of UTP guidance in 2007; Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The $225.5 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to: A $240.5 million decrease in net cash used resulting from the 2008 acquisitions of Fermat, BQuotes, Financial Projections Limited and Enb Consulting. Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 The $194.6 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to: A $237.0 million increase in net cash used resulting from the 2008 acquisitions of Fermat, BQuotes, Financial Projections Limited and Enb Consulting; A $55.9 million decrease of net cash provided by short term investments in 2008 following the liquidation of a majority of the portfolio in 2007 to finance share repurchases and other operational activities, Partially offset by: A $97.4 million decrease in capital additions resulting from reduced 7WTC build out activity in 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash used in financing activities Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The $1.0 million decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily attributed to: A $592.9 million decrease in treasury shares repurchased in 2009 compared to 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares during 2009; Partially offset by: Net repayments of $274.0 million on short term borrowings resulting from the Company utilizing operating cash flow to repay outstanding borrowings in 2009 compared to net borrowings of $166.3 million in 2008; A $150.0 million decrease relating to proceeds received in May 2008 from the 2008 Term Loan. Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 The $515.9 million decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily attributed to: A $1,145.5 million decrease in treasury shares repurchased in 2008 compared to 2007, A $44.7 million decrease in Excess Tax Benefits due to fewer stock option exercises; Partially offset by: A $381.1 million net increase in short term borrowings under the Companys CP program and revolving credit facilities, the proceeds of which were used to fund share repurchases and other operational and investing activities; A $150.0 million increase in long term debt resulting from the issuance of the 2008 Term Loan compared to $300.0 million received in 2007 from the issuance of the Series 2007 1 Notes. Future Cash Requirements The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources. The Company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions in related businesses, repurchasing stock and paying a modest dividend. In the near term, Moodys intends to maintain its dividend and has commenced a modest share repurchase program, the continuation of which is dependent on Moodys liquidity and 46 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents market conditions. As of December 31, 2009 Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program, which does not have an established expiration. At December 31, 2009 the Company had total borrowings outstanding from its CP Program of $443.7 million, the proceeds of which were or will be used to support the remaining build out of Moodys Canary Wharf location, potential acquisitions, share repurchases and other operational and investing activities. At December 31, 2009, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt with approximately $556 million of additional capacity available. Principal payments on the 2008 Term Loan commenced in September 2010 and will continue through its maturity in accordance with the schedule of payments outlined in Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. On March 27, 2009 the Company approved the 2009 Restructuring Plan to reduce costs in response to a strategic review of its business in certain jurisdictions and weak global economic and market conditions. This resulted in a restructuring charge of $15.6 million, all of which was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. The remaining liability of $5 million will result in cash outlays that will be substantially paid out over the next twelve months. On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the Canary Wharf district of London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5 year term is approximately 134 million GBP, and the Company will begin making base rent payments in 2011. In addition to the base rent payments the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligation. For periods subsequent to December 31, 2009 the Company expects to incur approximately 17 million GBP of costs to build out the floors to its specifications, substantially all of which is expected to be incurred over the next twelve months. On December 31, 2007, the Company approved the 2007 Restructuring Plan that would reduce global head count, terminate certain technology contracts and consolidate certain corporate functions in response to both the Companys Reorganization announced on August 7, 2007 as well as a decline in the then current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors. Included in the $50.0 million restructuring charge reported in 2007 is $7.0 million of non cash settlements relating to pension curtailments and stock based compensation award modifications for certain terminated employees. At December 31, 2009, the remaining cash payments of approximately $1 million are expected to be paid over the next twelve months and the remaining liability of approximately $8 million, which relates to the Companys unfunded pension plans, will be paid in accordance with plan provisions. The amount to be paid over the next twelve months relating to these pension liabilities is not expected to be material. On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moodys headquarters. The 7WTC Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the 7WTC Lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. On March 28, 2007, the 7WTC lease agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square feet at 7WTC. The additional base rent is approximately $106 million over a 20 year term. The total remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2009, including the aforementioned rent credits, are approximately $585 million. The Company also intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 15, 2009, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of 10.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2010. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the Legacy Tax Matters that are discussed in this MD&A under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. MOODYS 2009 10 K 47 Table of Contents Indebtedness The following table summarizes total indebtedness: December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Facility $ $ 613.0 Commercial paper, net of unamortized discount of $0.1 million at 2009 and $0.3 million at 2008 443.7 104.7 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 3.8 Notes payable: Series 2005 1 Notes 300.0 300.0 Series 2007 1 Notes 300.0 300.0 2008 Term Loan 146.2 150.0 Total Debt 1,193.7 1,467.7 Current portion (447.5 ) (717.7 ) Total long term debt $ 746.2 $ 750.0 2007 Facility On September 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. The 2007 Facility will serve, in part, to support the Companys CP Program described below. Interest on borrowings is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the outstanding borrowing amount depending on the Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points per annum of the facility amount, depending on the Companys Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 5.0 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as December 31, 2008 was 1.47%. The 2007 Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The 2007 Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Commercial Paper On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re borrowed. The CP Program is supported by the Companys 2007 Facility. The maturities of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The weighted average interest rate on CP borrowings outstanding was 0.3% and 2.08% as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The CP Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non payment of principal, interest or fees; violation of covenants; invalidity of any loan document; material judgments; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. Notes Payable On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007 1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007 1 Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi annually on March 7 and September 7. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007 1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create liens, enter into any sale leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. 48 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015 pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005 1 Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005 1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% senior notes which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all, or part, of the Series 2005 1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005 1 Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. 2008 Term Loan On May 7, 2008, Moodys entered into a five year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan is payable quarterly at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 125 basis points to 175 basis points depending on the Companys Debt/EBITDA ratio. The outstanding borrowings shall amortize beginning in 2010 in accordance with the schedule of payments set forth in the 2008 Term Loan outlined in the table below. The 2008 Term Loan contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company to engage or to permit its subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also limits the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The principal payments due on the 2008 Term Loan through its maturity are as follows: Year Ending December 31, 2010 $ 3.8 2011 11.3 2012 71.2 2013 63.7 Total $ 150.0 Also, on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR based variable interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan as more fully discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest (Expense) Income, Net The following table summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Income $ 2.5 $ 18.1 $ 19.3 Expense on borrowings (45.5 ) (60.0 ) (40.7 ) UTBs and other tax related interest 1.6 (13.7 ) (21.5 ) Reversal of accrued interest (a) 6.5 2.3 17.5 Interest capitalized 1.5 1.1 1.1 Total $ (33.4 ) $ (52.2 ) $ (24.3 ) Interest paid $ 46.1 $ 59.5 $ 32.5 (a) Represents a reduction of accrued interest related to the favorable resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the covenants described above, the 2007 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement and the 2008 Term Loan contain cross default provisions whereby default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. MOODYS 2009 10 K 49 Table of Contents The Companys long term debt, including the current portion, is recorded at cost. The fair value and carrying value of the Companys long term debt as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 CarryingAmount Estimated FairValue CarryingAmount Estimated FairValue Series 2005 1 Notes $ 300.0 $ 291.1 $ 300.0 $ 271.9 Series 2007 1 Notes 300.0 298.6 300.0 278.1 2008 Term Loan 150.0 150.0 150.0 150.0 Total $ 750.0 $ 739.7 $ 750.0 $ 700.0 The fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on prevailing interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar maturities. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2009, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Indebtedness (1) $ 1,447.1 $ 486.9 $ 159.9 $ 130.7 $ 669.6 Operating lease obligations 905.2 57.9 105.9 108.9 632.5 Purchase obligations (2) 129.0 68.9 43.4 16.7 Pension obligations (3) 74.2 8.8 11.5 7.4 46.5 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 Total (4) $ 2,556.8 $ 623.8 $ 320.7 $ 263.7 $ 1,348.6 (1) Reflects principal payments, related interest and applicable fees due on the 2008 Term Loan, the Series 2005 1 Notes, the Series 2007 1 Notes, borrowings under the CP Program and the 2007 Facility, as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Includes amounts contractually committed to for the fit out of the Canary Wharf Lease. (3) Reflects projected benefit payments for the next ten years relating to the Companys unfunded Post Retirement Benefit Plans described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) The table above does not include the Companys long term tax liabilities of $164.2 million and $52.8 million relating to UTP and Legacy Tax Matters, respectively, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably estimated. 2010 OUTLOOK Moodys outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company expects full year 2010 revenue to increase in the high single digit percent range. Full year 2010 expenses are also expected to increase in the high single digit percent range. Full year 2010 operating margin is projected in the high thirties percent range and the effective tax rate is expected in the range of 37 to 38 percent. Share repurchase is expected to resume at modest levels in 2010 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 in the range of $1.75 to $1.85. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of year 2009 rates. 50 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2010 is expected to increase in the high single to low double digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the mid teens percent range, while non U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is expected to increase in the high teens percent range with anticipated growth in speculative grade issuance activity offset by moderation of investment grade issuance from the high volume of 2009. Structured finance revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range reflecting modest growth in most asset classes. Revenue from financial institution ratings is expected to increase in the low single digit percent range, while revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance is expected to increase in the low double digit percent range. For Moodys Analytics, full year 2010 revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range. Revenue growth is expected in the low single digit percent range for RD&A, the mid teens percent range for RMS, and the high single to low double digit percent range for professional services. MA revenue is expected to increase in the low single digit percent range in the U.S. and in the mid single digit percent range outside the U.S. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Adopted: In December 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires additional disclosures about assets held in an employers defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard as of December 31, 2009 and has presented the required disclosures in the prescribed format in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. This new standard only affected the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements and did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. During the period ending September 30, 2009, the Company adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which only affected the specific references to GAAP literature in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Not yet adopted: In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new standard eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. The Company will adopt this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2010 and does not expect the implementation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 13, "Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("ASU 2009 13"). The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price ("VSOE") if available, third party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2009 13 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after January 1, 2010. If applied in the same manner to the year ended December 31, 2009, ASU 2009 13 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its MIS and MA segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 is also not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on its current pricing strategies. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. The new standard requires disclosure regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 classifications within the fair value hierarchy as well as requiring further detail of activity within the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy. The new standard also requires disclosures regarding the fair value for each class of assets and liabilities, which is a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in a companys balance sheet. Additionally, the standard will require further disclosures surrounding inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the implementation of ASU No. 2010 06 on its consolidated financial statements. CONTINGENCIES From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate. MOODYS 2009 10 K 51 Table of Contents Following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last two years, MIS and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing investigation, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MISs compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards. Moodys has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries. Moodys is cooperating with a review by the SEC relating to errors in the model used by MIS to rate certain constant proportion debt obligations. In addition, the Company is facing market participant litigation relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moodys in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment. On June 27, 2008, the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants oversight of MISs ratings of RMBS and constant proportion debt obligations, and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about MISs ratings practices and or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief. On July 2, 2008, Thomas R. Flynn, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief. The cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in November 2008. The Company removed the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2008. In January 2009, the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, which the Company opposed. On February 23, 2010, the court issued an opinion remanding the case to the Supreme Court of New York. On October 30, 2008, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. This complaint also asserts various causes of action relating to the Companys ratings of RMBS, CDO and constant proportion debt obligations, and named defendants participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about MISs ratings practices and or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. On December 9, 2008, Rena Nadoff, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and its CEO, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged overrating of asset backed securities and underrating of municipal securities. On October 20, 2009, the Company moved to dismiss or stay the action in favor of related federal litigation. On January 26, 2010, the court entered a stipulation and order, submitted jointly by the parties, staying the Nadoff litigation pending coordination and prosecution of similar claims in the above and below described federal derivative actions. On July 6, 2009, W. A. Sokolowski, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and current and former officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts claims relating to alleged mismanagement of the Companys processes for rating structured finance transactions, alleged insider trading and causing the Company to buy back its own stock at artificially inflated prices. Two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the Companys securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moodys Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Companys securities during the period February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and or misleading statements concerning the Companys business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MISs ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others. For claims, litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes 52 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. The Company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative, regulatory, enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position, financial position or results of operations. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate monetary liability of the Company for the pending matters referred to above (other than the Legacy Tax Matters that are discussed below) is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, although it is possible that the effect could be material to the Companys consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Legacy Tax Matters Moodys continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from Legacy Tax Matters. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $55.8 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000 Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. The following summary of the relationships among Moodys, New D&B and their predecessor entities is important in understanding our exposure to the Legacy Tax Matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into two separate public companies: Old D&B and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. In September 2000, Old D&B separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys. Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Old D&B and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable IRS determinations on certain tax matters, and certain other potential tax liabilities, all as described in such agreements. Further, in connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these Legacy Tax Matters. Settlement agreements were executed with the IRS in 2005 regarding the Legacy Tax Matters for the years 1989 1990 and 1993 1996. These settlements represent substantially all of the total potential liability to the IRS, including penalties. As of December 31, 2009, the Company continues to carry a liability of $1.9 million for the remaining potential exposure. In addition, with respect to these settlement agreements, Moodys and New D&B believe that IMS Health and NMR did not pay their full share of the liability to the IRS pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties. Moodys and New D&B paid these amounts to the IRS on their behalf, and attempted to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR. As a result, Moodys and New D&B commenced arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR in connection with the 1989 1990 matter. This matter was resolved during the third quarter of 2008 in favor of Moodys and New D&B, resulting in IMS Health and NMR having paid a total of $6.7 million to Moodys. In the second quarter of 2009, Moodys and New D&B reached a settlement with IMS Health and NMR with respect to the 1993 1996 matter, resulting in $10.8 million of cash proceeds paid to Moodys of which $6.5 million represents interest and $4.3 million is a reduction of tax expense. Amortization Expense Deductions This Legacy Tax Matter, which was affected by developments in June 2007 and 2008 as further described below, involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. IRS audits of Old D&Bs and New D&Bs tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in June 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions, or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction. These audits resulted in the IRS issuing the Notices for other tax issues for the 1997 2000 years aggregating $9.5 million in tax and penalties, plus statutory interest of approximately $6 million, which should be apportioned among Moodys, New D&B, IMS Health and NMR pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements. Moodys share of this assessment was $6.6 million including interest, net of tax. In November 2007, the IRS assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment, together with interest. The Company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the IRSs actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts. The absence of any tax deficiencies in the Notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2002, MOODYS 2009 10 K 53 Table of Contents combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002, for issues not assessed, resulted in Moodys recording an earnings benefit of $52.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. This is comprised of two components, as follows: (i) a reversal of a tax liability of $27.3 million related to the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date, reducing the provision for income taxes; and (ii) a reduction of accrued interest expense of $17.5 million ($10.6 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non operating income of $14.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B. In June 2008, the statute of limitations for New D&B relating to the 2003 tax year expired. As a result, in the second quarter of 2008, Moodys recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of $2.3 million ($1.4 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non operating income of $6.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys carries a liability of $1.1 million with respect to this matter. On the Distribution Date, New D&B paid Moodys $55.0 million for 50% of certain anticipated future tax benefits of New D&B through 2012. It is possible that IRS audits of New D&B for tax years after 2003 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction. In the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by New D&B, or there is an audit adjustment, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that New D&B incurs. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys liability with respect to this matter totaled $52.8 million. In March 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. In July 2007, New D&B and Moodys commenced procedures to recover approximately $57 million of these deposits ($24.6 million for New D&B and $31.9 million for Moodys), which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the Notices. As noted above, in November 2007 the IRS used $7.9 million of Moodys portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008 the IRS returned to Moodys $33.1 million in connection with this matter, which includes $3.0 million of interest. In July 2008, the IRS paid Moodys the remaining $1.8 million balance of the original deposit, and in September 2008 the IRS paid Moodys $0.2 million of interest on that balance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption Market Risk in Part II, Item 7 on page 43 of this annual report on Form 10 K. MOODYS 2009 10 K 55 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moodys Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This MD&A contains Forward Looking Statements. See Forward Looking Statements commencing on page 54 and Item 1A. Risk Factors commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. THE COMPANY Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) risk management software and (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions and training services. Moodys operates in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes investor oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events. The RD&A business also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its RMS business, MA provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software solutions. Within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures, credit portfolio management solutions and training services. Beginning in January 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines were realigned. All of Moodys other non rating commercial activities are represented in the MA segment. As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business. In 2008 within MA, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and professional services businesses. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products; and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis. Subscription services are typically sold for an initial 12 month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual periods. In 2009, the aforementioned MA businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the MA segment at December 31, 2009. Pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed Research Data and Analytics and the software business was renamed Risk Management Software. The revised groupings classify certain subscription based risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined RMS business. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring liabilities, pension and other post retirement benefits, UTBs and stock based compensation. Actual MOODYS 2009 10 K 27 Table of Contents results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, MIS uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where MIS does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, MIS defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, deferred revenue included approximately $45 million, $48 million and $54 million, respectively, related to such monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods, ranging from three to 51 years, which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $78 million, $82 million and $86 million, respectively. MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, accounts receivable included approximately $27 million, $34 million and $38 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Revenue earned within the MA segment is recognized as follows: subscription based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial 12 month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods, beginning upon delivery of the initial product; software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs; professional service revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed. Certain revenue arrangements within the MA segment include multiple elements such as software licenses, maintenance, subscription fees and professional services. In these types of arrangements, the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value; that is, generally the price charged when sold separately or vendor specific objective evidence. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moodys records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are charged against the allowance. Moodys evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts. Moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moodys adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates. Each quarter, the Company revises its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the Contingencies section of this MD&A, commencing on page 51 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where 28 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities. Based on its review of the latest information available, and subject to the contingencies described in Item 7. MD&A Contingencies, the ultimate monetary liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated financial position, although it is possible that the effect could be material to the Companys consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $4.3 million, $8.7 million and $27.3 million, respectively, due to changes in the Companys liabilities for Legacy Tax exposures that were assumed by Moodys in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are more fully described under the caption Legacy Tax Matters within Item 7, MD&A. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, annually as of November 30th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350. These impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. During 2009 there was a change in the reporting unit structure of MA to reflect the realignment under which the MA segment is currently managed. Accordingly, it was determined that MA had three reporting units within its segment: RD&A; RMS and training. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, in depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The RMS reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance. The training reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training. As such, at the date of the impairment test, the Company had four primary reporting units: MIS, which encompasses the Companys ratings operations and the aforementioned three reporting units within MA. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level by ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other". In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived acquired intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate market comparables. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units. As a result of the reporting structure realignment in the MA segment described above, the company reassigned the assets and liabilities of the MA segment to each of its reporting units. Goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach; other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units. Based on the result of the above test, the Company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing Step 1 of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value. MOODYS 2009 10 K 29 Table of Contents The following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of November 30, 2009: Step One Sensitivity Analysis Deficit Caused by a Hypothetical Reduction to Fair Value Goodwill 10% 15% 20% 25% MIS $ 11.6 $ $ $ $ RD&A 158.7 RMS 165.2 (5.3 ) Training 18.5 Totals $ 354.0 $ $ $ $ (5.3 ) The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. The results of the DCF are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the DCF fair values. The DCF analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value, including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. Moodys allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments. The following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment: WACC The WACC is the rate to discount each reporting units estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting units cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Companys outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 10% to 12% in 2009. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is due primarily to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units. An increase in the WACC of 1% for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350. Future cash flow assumptions The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. Cash flows for each of the next five years beginning in 2010 were estimated based on annual revenue growth rates ranging from 1% to 16%. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets which began in the second half of 2009. Beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units. A decrease in the growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculation of 10% for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350. However, there is a greater probability of potential goodwill impairment in the RMS and training reporting units if estimated growth rates are not met due to the lower percentage by which the fair value of these reporting units exceeds the carrying value. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The difficult market and economic conditions in 2009 resulted in lower than anticipated revenue for the RMS and training reporting units compared to forecasted results causing the Company to test the intangible assets within these reporting units for impairment at November 30, 2009. This test was performed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group that contained the aforementioned intangible assets to the carrying amount of the asset group. The undiscounted cash flows were sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset group and resulted in an excess of 39% and 48% for the RMS and training reporting units, respectively. 30 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Restructuring The Company has engaged in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs, contract termination costs and asset impairments. If the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted. For both the 2007 Restructuring Plan and the 2009 Restructuring Plan, there have not been any significant differences between original estimates and actual amounts recorded upon completion of both plans. For a full description of Moodys restructuring actions, refer to the Results of Operations section below and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moodys reports for its pension and other post retirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: future compensation increases, based on the Companys long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments) future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Companys benefit obligations as of December 31, 2009 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Companys Post Retirement Plans. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. The Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding gain or loss over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning of year projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. For Moodys Post Retirement Plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2009 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $55.0 million, and Moodys expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of $3.3 million in 2010 for the amortization of actuarial losses. For Moodys funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has an unrecognized asset loss of $20.7 million, of which $6.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2011 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moodys 2010 operating income. These effects have been calculated using the Companys current projections of 2010 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moodys Post Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2010 Estimated Impact on2010 Operating Income(Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.95% / 5.75% $ (6.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.5 Assumed Long Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.3 ) * Discount rates of 5.95% and 5.75% are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2010 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to Post Retirement Plans will be $21.6 million in 2010 compared with $14.5 million in 2009. The expected expense increase in 2010 reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to assumption changes, such as higher cash balance interest crediting rate and lower discount rates, as well as higher amortization of actuarial losses. MOODYS 2009 10 K 31 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation The Company records compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moodys experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2009 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used for2004 2009 grants Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact onOperating Income in 2009Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 0.1% 2% 0.10% $ 0.7 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 23% 43.7% 5% $ (3.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (3.1 ) Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Companys tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter company transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. Moodys is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve Legacy Tax and other tax matters. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTPs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non operating expenses. For UTPs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTPs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Companys operating results or financial condition. For certain of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested within its foreign operations. Accordingly, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the Company which may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moodys. 32 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents OPERATING SEGMENTS Beginning in January 2008, Moodys segments were changed to reflect the Reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the Reorganization, the rating agency is reported in the MIS segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moodys other non rating commercial activities are represented in the MA segment. As part of the Reorganization there were several realignments within the MIS LOBs. Sovereign and sub sovereign ratings, which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the public finance business to form a new LOB called public, project and infrastructure finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business. Furthermore, in August 2008 the global managed investments ratings group, previously part of the structured finance business, was combined with the financial institutions business. The MIS segment now consists of four lines of business structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. As part of the Reorganization, various aspects of the legacy MIS research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and professional services businesses within MA. The subscriptions business included credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial 12 month term, with renewal features for subsequent annual periods; the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk, securities pricing and valuation software products; and the professional services business included credit training associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis. In 2009, the aforementioned MA businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the MA segment at December 31, 2009. Pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed Research, Data and Analytics and the software business was renamed Risk Management Software. The revised groupings classify license software sales, certain subscription based risk management software revenue, maintenance and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined RMS business. The following tables are reconciliations of the revenue groupings previously disclosed to the new groupings for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Revenue reported as per filings in prior years: 2008 2007 Subscriptions $ 475.9 $ 421.5 Software 49.2 39.5 Professional Services 25.6 18.1 Total MA $ 550.7 $ 479.1 Year Ended December 31, Reclass for 2009 realignment: 2008 2007 Subscriptions $ (57.2 ) $ (51.2 ) Software 59.6 52.9 Professional Services (2.4 ) (1.7 ) Total MA $ $ Year Ended December 31, 2009 revenue reported: 2008 2007 RD&A $ 418.7 $ 370.3 RMS 108.8 92.4 Professional Services 23.2 16.4 Total MA $ 550.7 $ 479.1 MOODYS 2009 10 K 33 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments, excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company are allocated to each segment based on a revenue split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resource, information technology and legal. In addition to its reported results, Moodys has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as non GAAP financial measures. Management believes that such non GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Companys performance. These non GAAP financial measures relate to Legacy Tax Matters and expenses and adjustments made to both the Companys 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans, further described in Note 17 and Note 10, respectively, to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 Executive summary Moodys revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $1,797.2 million, an increase of $41.8 million from 2008. Excluding the negative impact from changes in FX translation rates, revenue in 2009 increased $76.6 million compared to the same period in 2008. Total expenses for 2009 were $1,109.7 million, an increase of $102.5 million from 2008, and included approximately $32 million in favorable changes from FX translation rates. Operating income of $687.5 million in 2009 decreased $60.7 million compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of restructuring in both years, operating income was $705.0 million, a decrease of $40.7 million from the prior year. Diluted EPS of $1.69 in 2009 included a $0.05 unfavorable impact from restructuring actions and a $0.04 favorable impact relating to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter. Excluding the aforementioned items in 2009, diluted EPS of $1.70 decreased $0.12, or 7%, from $1.82 in 2008, which excludes the prior year favorable per share impacts of $0.01 and $0.04 for restructuring and the resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, respectively.

The MIS growth is reflective of gradual improvement in the credit markets throughout 2009 which resulted in increased issuance volumes for fundamental ratings, particularly for investment grade and high yield corporate debt, partially offset by continued declines in structured finance issuance. The MA growth is primarily due to higher international RMS revenue which resulted from the Fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the negative impact from changes in FX translation rates, Moodys revenue in 2009 increased $76.6 million compared to 2008. Transaction revenue accounted for 37% of global MCO revenue in 2009 compared to 36% in the prior year. Transaction revenue in the MIS segment represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other one time fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation and or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes and shelf registrations. In the MA segment, relationship revenue represents subscription based revenues and software maintenance revenue. Transaction revenue in MA represents software license fees and revenue from the professional services line of business which offers credit risk management advisory and training services, which are typically sold on a per engagement basis. In the U.S., revenue increased $10.7 million with modest growth in MIS being partially offset by declines in MA. The increase in ratings revenue primarily reflects the aforementioned recovery in the investment grade and high yield corporate bond markets partially offset by declines in structured finance ratings. Revenue declined for all LOBs within MA. International revenue of $876.4 million for 2009 was $31.1 million higher than 2008 and reflected growth in investment grade and high yield rated issuance within CFG as well as MA revenue which benefited from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. These increases were partially offset by significant declines in SFG revenue within MIS as well as approximately $35 million in unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. Total expenses for 2009 were $1,109.7 million, an increase of $102.5 million from 2008. The increase primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008, costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan and higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Additionally, there were higher rent and occupancy costs in 2009 related to the Canary Wharf lease in London, higher professional services costs which include legal and IT consulting as well as a charge for an international VAT matter. The aforementioned increases were partially offset by an approximate $32 million favorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. Operating expenses were $532.4 million, an increase of $39.1 million from the prior year, resulting primarily from higher compensation costs of approximately $28 million compared to the same period in 2008. Compensation costs were $445.1 million, an increase of 7% from prior year, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Non compensation expenses in 2009 were $87.3 million, an increase of approximately $11 million compared to the same period in 2008. The increase is due to higher professional service costs which include technology consulting costs associated with an investment in IT infrastructure. The increase in both compensation and non compensation expenses were partially offset by favorable changes in FX translation rates. SG&A expenses of $495.7 million were $54.4 million higher than prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher non compensation costs, which reflect higher rent expense relating to the Canary Wharf lease in London, additional bad debt expense due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions, higher professional services costs which include consulting as well as higher costs associated with investment in technology infrastructure. Compensation costs of $250.1 million increased 7% over the same period in 2008 primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation costs due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results. Restructuring expenses of $17.5 million in 2009 reflect costs associated with headcount reductions, the divestiture of non strategic assets and contract terminations in accordance with the 2009 Restructuring Plan, as well as adjustments to previous estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan. The restructuring benefit of $2.5 million in 2008 reflects adjustments to previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring Plan. MOODYS 2009 10 K 35 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization of $64.1 million decreased $11.0 million from 2008 primarily due to the following items in 2008: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of Fermat and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Companys New Jersey office. The absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income of $687.5 million decreased $60.7 million from prior year reflecting the 10% increase in operating expenses being partially offset by modest revenue increases. Excluding the impact of restructuring in both years, operating income of $705.0 million decreased $40.7 million. Changes in FX translation rates had a $3 million unfavorable impact on operating income in 2009. Interest (expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 was ($33.4) million, a decrease of $18.8 million compared to the same period in 2008. The change is due primarily to an interest expense reduction of approximately $12 million for tax and tax related liabilities recorded in the first quarter of 2009 coupled with a $6.5 million favorable resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2009. Interest expense on borrowings decreased approximately $15 million compared to 2008 reflecting lower short term debt balances coupled with lower interest rates on borrowings under the 2007 Facility and CP Program. During 2009, the Company has utilized its operating cash flow to reduce short term borrowings by 38%. Additionally, interest income decreased approximately $16 million compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting lower interest rate yields on cash and cash equivalents balances. Other non operating income (expense), net in 2009 was $(7.9) million compared to $33.8 million in 2008. The change reflects FX losses of $9.5 million in 2009 compared to FX gains of $24.7 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the weakening of the euro to the British pound in 2009 relating to accounts receivable denominated in non functional currencies as well as $11 million in favorable adjustments for Legacy Tax Matters in 2008. Moodys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 37.0%, or 30 bps higher than the prior year. Excluding Legacy Tax Matters in both years, the ETR in 2009 of 37.6% increased 50 bps from 2008. Net Income in 2009 was $402.0 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, and decreased $55.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of restructuring and Legacy Tax Matters in both years, Net Income in 2009 decreased $40.6 million to $404.7 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, from $1.82 in the same period of 2008. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further analysis and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Revenue: Structured finance $ 304.9 $ 404.7 (24.7 )% Corporate finance 408.2 307.0 33.0 % Financial institutions 258.5 263.0 (1.7 )% Public, project and infrastructure finance 246.1 230.0 7.0 % Total 1,217.7 1,204.7 1.1 % Expenses: Operating and SG&A 680.1 636.0 6.9 % Restructuring 9.1 (1.6 ) NM Depreciation and amortization 31.3 33.3 (6.0 )% Total 720.5 667.7 7.9 % Operating income $ 497.2 $ 537.0 (7.4 )% Global MIS revenue in 2009 of $1,217.7 million increased $13.0 million, or $35.9 million excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, compared to 2008. The increase from prior year reflects growth in rated issuance in the investment grade and high yield sectors of CFG coupled with increases in public and infrastructure ratings revenue within PPIF. These increases were partially offset by declines in new issuance in SFG and FIG. Transaction revenue for total MIS in 2009 was 50% compared to 49% in 2008. In the U.S., revenue was $663.1 million, an increase of $18.1 million or 3% from prior year reflecting strong growth in ratings of investment and speculative grade corporate debt partially offset by new issuance declines which were significant in SFG and modest 36 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents in FIG. Non U.S. revenue was $554.6 million and decreased 1% from the same period in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects declines in all international regions within SFG partially offset by growth in CFG and PPIF in EMEA due to higher issuance volumes. Global SFG revenue of $304.9 million decreased $99.8 million reflecting the continued slowdown of new issuance in the securitization markets due to reduced investor appetite, continued high interest rate spreads and higher credit enhancements. The continued decline in new issuance resulted in transaction revenue in 2009 representing 41% of total SFG revenue, compared to 50% in 2008. In the U.S., revenue of $142.1 million decreased $42.1 million with the most prevalent declines in the Derivatives, ABS and CMBS sectors. Non U.S. revenue was $162.8 million and declined $57.7 million from 2008, with 41% of the decrease occurring within EMEA Derivatives. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates had a $7 million impact on international SFG revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. Global CFG revenue of $408.2 million increased $101.2 million from the prior year which included approximately $6 million of unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates. The global increase is due primarily to higher rated issuance in the investment grade and high yield sectors. Transaction revenue represented 64% of total CFG revenue, an increase from 54% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue was $251.2 million, an increase of $68.1 million compared to 2008, reflecting strong growth in both investment grade and high yield bond issuance. U.S. revenue accounted for 62% of global CFG compared to 60% in the prior year period. The growth in investment grade rated issuance reflects an increase in the number of companies refinancing debt ahead of expected maturities to take advantage of favorable interest rates within the corporate finance markets and to improve liquidity. The activity in the U.S. high yield markets increased revenue by approximately $45 million, with 68% of the growth occurring in the second half of 2009. The growth in speculative grade rated issuance reflects increased investor confidence in the high yield market and the continued narrowing of interest rate spreads compared to U.S. Treasuries which began in the second quarter of 2009. Internationally, revenue of $157.0 million in 2009 increased 27% compared to the same period in 2008, driven primarily by growth in investment grade issuance within EMEA and high yield issuance across all non U.S. regions, reflecting early debt refinancing activities. Global FIG revenue of $258.5 million declined $4.5 million from the prior year, with declines in the U.S. being partially offset by modest growth internationally. Transaction revenue declined to 31% of total FIG revenue, compared to 33% in the same period of 2008. In the U.S., 2009 revenue of $107.3 million decreased $10.5 million from 2008, primarily within specialty insurance which reflects continued contraction within the sector. Outside the U.S., revenue was $151.2 million, an increase of 4% from the prior year due primarily to growth in the banking sector in the Canada and Latin America regions. Unfavorable changes in FX translation rates negatively impacted international FIG revenue by approximately $6 million. Global PPIF revenue was $246.1 million and increased $16.1 million compared to the same period in 2008 with increases in public finance and infrastructure finance being partially offset by declines in U.S. municipal structured products. Revenue generated from new transactions comprised 59% of global PPIF, unchanged from the same period of 2008. In the U.S., PPIF revenue increased $2.6 million compared to 2008 with growth in public finance reflecting higher issuance related to the Build America Bond Program which was implemented in the U.S. as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, coupled with higher project and infrastructure revenue. These increases were partially offset by declines in issuance for municipal structured products which reflects declines in bank capacity and a lower market penetration for insured transactions. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue increased $13.5 million, or 19% over 2008, reflecting growth in infrastructure finance and public finance revenue in EMEA partially offset by declines in project finance in Asia. Excluding the $4 million unfavorable impact of changes in FX translation rates, international revenue grew $17.7 million compared to the same period in 2008. Operating and SG&A expenses in 2009 increased $44.1 million, reflecting increases in compensation and non compensation costs of approximately $26 million and $18 million, respectively. The increase in compensation costs compared to 2008 related to higher incentive compensation due to greater achievement against 2009 targeted results being partially offset by cost savings realized from the 2007 and 2009 Restructuring Plans, $6 million of senior executive severance costs included in 2008 and the impact of favorable changes in FX translation rates. The increase in non compensation costs reflects higher rent and occupancy costs for the Canary Wharf Lease, higher professional services costs which include legal and IT consulting and a higher allowance for uncollectible accounts due to the deterioration of liquidity caused by general economic conditions. Additionally, there was a charge in 2009 for an international VAT matter. Restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the 2009 Restructuring Plan as well as adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2007 Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization of $31.3 million decreased $2.0 million from the prior year and was primarily due to the 2008 accelerated depreciation for the New Jersey office facility closure being partially offset by higher depreciation relating to costs capitalized for ongoing IT systems projects which were placed in service during 2009. MOODYS 2009 10 K 37 Table of Contents Operating income of $497.2 million was $39.8 million lower than 2008 primarily reflecting the 8% increase in total expenses. Changes in FX translation rates had an immaterial impact on operating income during in 2009. Moodys Analytics The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Revenue: RD&A $ 413.6 $ 418.7 (1.2 )% RMS 145.1 108.8 33.4 % Professional services 20.8 23.2 (10.3 )% Total 579.5 550.7 5.2 % Expenses: Operating and SG&A 348.0 298.6 16.5 % Restructuring 8.4 (0.9 ) NM Depreciation and amortization 32.8 41.8 (21.5 )% Total 389.2 339.5 14.6 % Operating income $ 190.3 $ 211.2 (9.9 )% Global MA revenue increased $28.8 million, with all of the growth generated internationally, and included a negative $12 million impact from changes in FX translation. Recurring revenue comprised 89% of total revenue in 2009, slightly lower than the 91% in 2008 reflecting higher RMS license and service revenue which is primarily transaction based. In the U.S., revenue of $257.7 million decreased 3%, reflecting declines across all LOBs. International revenue of $321.8 million was $36.2 million higher than in 2008, primarily reflecting strong growth in RMS resulting from the Fermat acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008. Global RD&A revenue, which comprises 71% of total MA in 2009, was down slightly compared to 2008 reflecting modestly higher attrition due to contraction among capital markets customers offset by demand for products that support analysis for investment and commercial credit applications. U.S. revenue was $212.5 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from 2008. Internationally, revenue totaled $201.1 million, a decrease of $1.4 million from the prior year. Global RMS revenue increased $36.3 million compared to 2008, and was primarily due to the Fermat acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $42.1 million was down $1.7 million compared prior year, while international revenue of $103.0 million increased $38.0 million reflecting the aforementioned acquisition made in the fourth quarter of 2008. Global professional services revenue decreased $2.4 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting declines in training services in the U.S. and EMEA as companies reduced their spending on these services due to the poor capital markets and economic conditions during 2009. Operating and SG&A expenses of $348.0 million increased $49.4 million from the prior year, reflecting higher compensation and non compensation costs. Compensation costs of $229.1 million increased $18.2 million from the prior year and reflected additional headcount from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008 partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from lower achievement against 2009 targeted results. Non compensation expenses were $118.9 million, an increase of $31.2 million compared to 2008, primarily due to higher rent and occupancy costs for the Canary Wharf Lease and higher expenses related to acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. The aforementioned increases for both compensation and non compensation costs were partially offset by favorable changes in FX translation rates. Restructuring expenses of $8.4 million reflect severance and contract termination costs associated with the divestiture of non strategic assets as well as adjustments made to previous estimates for the 2009 and 2007 Restructuring Plans. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $9.0 million from prior year, primarily due to adjustments recorded in 2008 relating to an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of Fermat. The absence of these items in 2009 was partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets during 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. 38 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Operating income of $190.3 million decreased $20.9 million compared to 2008, due to the 15% increase in expenses outpacing the 5% increase in revenue.

Moodys Corporation The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Revenue: United States $ 910.1 $ 1,361.8 (33.2 )% International: EMEA 603.1 659.3 (8.5 )% Other 242.2 237.9 1.8 % Total International 845.3 897.2 (5.8 )% Total 1,755.4 2,259.0 (22.3 )% Expenses: Operating 493.3 584.0 (15.5 )% SG&A 441.3 451.1 (2.2 )% Restructuring (2.5 ) 50.0 (105.0 )% Depreciation and amortization 75.1 42.9 75.1 % Total 1,007.2 1,128.0 (10.7 )% Operating income $ 748.2 $ 1,131.0 (33.8 )% Interest (expense) income, net $ (52.2 ) $ (24.3 ) 114.8 % Other non operating (expense) income, net $ 33.8 $ 15.3 120.9 % Net income attributed to Moodys $ 457.6 $ 701.5 (34.8 )% Total revenue of $1,755.4 million decreased $503.6 million from 2007, due to the significant decline in MIS partly offset by good growth in MA. Total relationship and transaction based revenue for Moodys in 2008 was 64% and 36%, respectively, compared to 45% and 55%, respectively in the prior year. MOODYS 2009 10 K 39 Table of Contents U.S. revenue was $910.1 million, down $451.7 million from the prior year primarily reflecting significantly reduced issuance activity due to the broader downturn in global economic activity, significant financial market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads. International revenue of $845.3 million decreased $51.9 million from 2007 and accounted for 48% of global revenue compared to 40% a year ago. FX translation contributed approximately $23 million to 2008 international revenue. Issuance volumes were significantly lower across most of the EMEA and Asian markets compared to 2007. Operating expenses were $493.3 million, down $90.7 million due primarily to lower compensation costs of $70.5 million. Incentive compensation of $30.8 million decreased $27.8 million due to weak financial performance within the MIS segment and the impact of restructuring. Salaries and wages decreased approximately $21 million primarily reflecting the effects of the 2007 restructuring. Stock based compensation of $40.6 million declined $17.3 million due to the impact of the 2007 restructuring which resulted in higher forfeitures of awards than in the previous year. Non compensation costs of $76.6 million decreased $20.2 million due to strong cost controls, particularly in the areas of T&E and recruiting which declined approximately $9 million and $3 million, respectively. SG&A expenses of $441.3 million decreased $9.8 million from the prior year due to declines in both compensation and non compensation expenses. Compensation costs decreased $4.9 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting reductions of approximately $5 million and $10 million in incentive and stock based compensation, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an approximate $9 million increase in salaries and wages due primarily to $6 million in senior executive severance expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Non compensation expenses of $207.4 million were down $4.9 million from prior year reflecting decreases in T&E, rent and occupancy costs, and professional service fees of $4.6 million, $5.4 million and $6.8 million, respectively, partially offset by approximately $11 million of bad debt reflecting the increase in bankruptcies and collection issues, compared to less than $1 million in 2007. The table below shows Moodys global staffing by geographic area: December 31, 2008* 2007 % Change United States 2,130 2,175 (2.1 )% International 1,817 1,397 30.1 % Total 3,947 3,572 10.5 % * reflects approximately 350 additional headcount due to acquisitions made during the year, of which approximately 290 were added in the fourth quarter. Restructuring in 2008 reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization of $75.1 million increased $32.2 million from 2007 primarily due to: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets within the MA segment, approximately $6 million of incremental depreciation reflecting the use of 7WTC for the full year of 2008, approximately $6 million of purchase accounting amortization associated with the acquisition of Fermat of which $4.5 million was a write off of acquired in process technology and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Companys New Jersey office in the second quarter of 2008. Operating income in 2008 of $748.2 million decreased $382.8 million from the prior year reflecting the significant decline in revenue resulting in an operating margin of 42.6%, which was 750 basis points lower than the 50.1% margin in 2007. Operating income in 2007 reflected a $50.0 million restructuring charge. FX translation positively impacted operating income by approximately $28 million. Interest income (expense), net was ($52.2) million, an increase of $27.9 million from prior year primarily due to higher debt levels and the absence in 2008 of $17.5 million of income relating to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $2.3 million in 2008. Other non operating income (expense), net was $33.8 million, up $18.5 million from the prior year, due primarily to FX gains of approximately $25 million recorded during the year reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the euro to the British pound. Moodys effective tax rate of 36.7% remained essentially flat with 37.0% in 2007. Excluding the impact of restructuring and Legacy Tax items in both years, Moodys ETR was 37.1%, down 290 bps from 40.0% in 2007, due primarily to a larger portion of consolidated taxable income being generated from outside the U.S., which is generally taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rate, and the realization of benefits available for U.S. based manufacturing and research activities. 40 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Net Income was $457.6 million, a decrease of $243.9 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting revenue declines that outpaced cost reductions. Excluding the impact of Legacy Tax Matters and restructuring, net income of $445.3 million was $235.3 million lower than 2007. Diluted EPS was $1.87, or 28% lower than in the prior year resulting from the 35% reduction in net income, partially offset by 10% fewer diluted shares outstanding. Segment Results Moodys Investors Service The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further analysis and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Revenue: Structured finance $ 404.7 $ 868.4 (53.4 )% Corporate finance 307.0 416.4 (26.3 )% Financial institutions 263.0 274.3 (4.1 )% Public, project and infrastructure finance 230.0 220.8 4.2 % Total 1,204.7 1,779.9 (32.3 )% Expenses: Operating and SG&A 636.0 759.4 (16.2 )% Restructuring (1.6 ) 41.3 (103.9 )% Depreciation and amortization 33.3 24.0 38.8 % Total $ 667.7 $ 824.7 (19.0 )% Operating income $ 537.0 $ 955.2 (43.8 )% Global MIS revenue of $1,204.7 million was down $575.2 million from 2007, reflecting the significant declines in global SFG and U.S. CFG revenue. In the U.S., revenue of $645.0 million was down $474.0 million, or 42%, due to decreases in SFG and CFG. Internationally, revenue was $559.7 million, a decline of $101.2 million, or 15%, from a year ago, with declines in SFG and CFG, partially offset by growth in PPIF. In 2008, international revenue comprised 46% of global revenue, compared to 37% in 2007. FX contributed approximately $16 million to international revenue in 2008. The split of revenue between relationship and transaction was 51% and 49%, respectively, versus the prior year when the split was 32% relationship and 68% transaction revenue. Globally, the lower proportion of transaction revenue in 2008 was primarily due to the significant decline in new issuance due to the broader downturn in global economic activity reflected in the extreme market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads in the later part of the year. Global SFG revenue decreased $463.7 million, due to declines in derivatives, CREF and RMBS of $196.0 million or 58%, $123.8 million or 69%, and $103.1 million or 58%, respectively, which together accounted for 91% of the decrease. Continued turbulence in the capital and credit markets, combined with lack of market liquidity and higher interest rate spreads, has resulted in lower loan origination and securitization which led to a significant decline in new issuance revenue. In 2008, transaction based revenue accounted for 50% of total SFG down from 77% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $184.2 million was down approximately $372 million or 67%, from a year ago, led by declines in the aforementioned asset classes due to significantly reduced issuance volume. International revenue was $220.5 million, a decrease of $91.4 million or 29% from 2007, led by declines in derivatives and CREF of $48.5 million or 42%, and $41.6 million or 66%, respectively. FX translation contributed approximately $8 million to international SFG revenue in 2008. Global CFG revenue was down $109.4 million from prior year, due to low issuance volumes particularly in the U.S. Revenue from new issuance declined 42% from the prior year, due primarily to lower issuance in both investment grade and speculative grade securities, resulting from the broader downturn in global economic activity, reflected in the significant financial market volatility, worsening credit market conditions and record high interest rate spreads in the later part of the year. Transaction based revenue comprised 54% of global CFG revenue, compared to 69% in 2007. Revenue in the U.S. was $183.1 million, a decrease of $91.8 million, or 33%, from the prior year as revenue from bank loans and speculative grade bond ratings declined $64.1 million or 66% and $30.6 million or 62%, respectively, and was slightly offset by $6.6 million, or 18%, of growth in revenue from monitoring fees. International revenue of $123.9 million was down $17.6 million, or 12%, from prior year comprised of declines in speculative grade bond ratings, bank loan ratings, estimated ratings and investment grade bond ratings of $10.4 million or 56%, $7.4 million or 67%, $4.4 million or 25%, and $3.7 million or 13%, respectively. These declines were offset by growth in monitoring fees of $5.3 million, MOODYS 2009 10 K 41 Table of Contents as well as an approximate $2 million increase in other CFG services such as national scale ratings and company credit assessment services. FX translation contributed approximately $3 million to international CFG revenue in 2008. Global FIG revenue decreased $11.3 million from the prior year reflecting significant declines in issuance volumes primarily in the U.S. insurance and banking markets due to the on going credit crisis. Revenue from new transactions accounted for 33% of total FIG in 2008, compared to 42% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $117.8 million decreased $12.2 million, or 9%, from prior year, led by an $8.9 million decline in the insurance sector, specifically the property and casualty insurance industry which was down $5.0 million or 22% from 2007. International revenue of $145.2 million remained flat with prior year reflecting growth from the life insurance industry offset by declines from rating financial guarantors and the property and casualty insurance industry. FX translation contributed $5 million to international FIG revenue in 2008. Global PPIF revenue increased $9.2 million from prior year due to growth in municipal structured products and in the project and infrastructure finance sectors of $10.3 million or 35%, and $2.5 million or 3%, respectively. Recurring revenue represented 41% of total in 2008 compared with 40% in 2007. In the U.S., revenue of $159.9 million grew $2.3 million, with increases in the aforementioned municipal structured products partially offset by declines of $6.4 million in other public finance issuance. Outside the U.S., revenue of $70.1 million was up $6.9 million, or 11%, from prior year, reflecting growth primarily within the EMEA region of $4.6 million and $2.1 million in the infrastructure finance and public finance sectors, respectively. Operating and SG&A expenses of $636.0 million, including allocated corporate overhead costs, decreased $123.4 million, with declines in both compensation and non compensation expenses of approximately $83 million and approximately $40 million, respectively. Incentive compensation decreased approximately $39 million primarily due to weak financial performance. Stock based compensation decreased approximately $20 million primarily reflecting the impact of the 2007 Restructuring Plan which resulted in higher forfeitures of awards than in the previous year. Salary and benefits expense decreased approximately $24 million from prior year, reflecting the change in the mix of employees and timing of adding new hires during the year, partially offset by approximately $6 million in senior executive severance expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in non compensation expenses from 2007 reflected continued strong cost controls, resulting in reductions within T&E, recruiting and marketing of $14.6 million, $3.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Offsetting these decreases in 2008 was an $8.1 million increase in bad debt expense compared to prior year, primarily related to bankruptcies and collection issues, including $2.3 million for Lehman Brothers and $1.7 million for issuers of structured investment vehicles. The 2008 restructuring amount primarily reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.3 million primarily due to the accelerated depreciation recorded in the second quarter of 2008 relating to the Jersey City office closure and a full year of depreciation on 7WTC assets. Operating income decreased $418.2 million from 2007 reflecting the 32% reduction in revenue outpacing the 19% decline in Operating and SG&A expenses. Excluding the impact of the 2007 restructuring and minor adjustments made in 2008 relating to this charge, operating income declined $461.1 million or 46% from the prior year. FX translation had a positive impact of approximately $17 million on MIS operating income in 2008. Moodys Analytics The table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Revenue: RD&A $ 418.7 $ 370.3 13.1 % RMS 108.8 92.4 17.7 % Professional services 23.2 16.4 41.5 % Total 550.7 479.1 14.9 % Expenses: Operating and SG&A 298.6 275.7 8.3 % Restructuring (0.9 ) 8.7 (110.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 41.8 18.9 121.2 % Total 339.5 303.3 11.9 % Operating income $ 211.2 $ 175.8 20.1 % 42 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents Global MA revenue increased $71.6 million, with 69% of the growth generated internationally, and accounted for 31% of global MCO revenue in 2008 compared to 21% in the prior year. Recurring revenue, which includes subscription and software maintenance fees, comprised 91% of the total in 2008, Compared to 92% in the prior year. In the U.S., revenue of $265.1 million increased 9%, primarily reflecting growth in RD&A revenue. International revenue of $285.6 million was $49.3 million higher than in 2007, reflecting growth in all business lines, particularly in RMS which benefited from the acquisition of Fermat. FX translation contributed approximately $7 million to international MA revenue in 2008. Global RD&A revenue, which comprises 76% of total MA in 2008, increased $48.4 million and accounted for 68% of global MA growth, reflecting continued demand from new and existing customers for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics, credit risk assessment and other offerings. U.S. revenue was $216.2 million, an increase of $20.8 million from 2007. Internationally, revenue totaled $202.5 million, an increase of $27.6 million or 16% over the prior year, with 80% of the growth generated within the EMEA region. Global RMS revenue increased $16.4 million, including the positive impact of the Fermat acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S. revenue of $43.8 million remained flat with prior year, while international revenue of $65.0 million increased $16.0 million or 33% from the prior year with growth generated from all regions. Global professional services revenue increased $6.8 million over prior year reflecting relatively higher demand internationally for credit education, portfolio analysis, risk modeling and scorecard development services, primarily in the EMEA region. Operating and SG&A expenses, including allocated corporate overhead costs, were $298.6, an increase of $22.9 million from the prior year due to increases in both compensation and non compensation expenses of approximately $8 million and approximately $15 million, respectively. The increase in compensation expense primarily reflects approximately $6 million of higher incentive compensation costs due to better than expected financial performance, and a 30% increase in average headcount due to acquisitions made during the year. Non compensation expenses of $98.0 million increased due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and a higher proportion of allocated corporate overhead expenses in 2008 compared to prior year based on the revenue split methodology, as well as the absence in 2008 of a $2.5 million sales tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2007. The 2008 restructuring amount primarily reflects adjustments of previous estimates for severance and contract termination costs associated with the Restructuring Plan. The increase in depreciation and amortization of $22.9 million compared to 2007 is primarily due to the approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangible assets and amortization of approximately $6 million related to the Fermat acquisition, including a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology. Operating income increased $35.4 million from 2007, reflecting strong revenue growth and an approximate $10 million positive impact from FX translation. MARKET RISK Moodys maintains operations in 26 countries outside the U.S. In 2009, approximately 45% and 50% of the Companys revenue billed and expenses incurred, respectively, were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the GBP and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 45% of Moodys assets were located outside the United States. Moodys aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $473.9 million at December 31, 2009, consisted of approximately $404 million, which was located outside the U.S., making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. Additionally, all of Moodys aggregate short term investments of $10.0 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non U.S. operations with non U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in the statement of shareholders equity (deficit). Moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high grade commercial paper. Short term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and high quality investment grade corporate bonds in Korea. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. A portion of the Companys future billings and related revenue is exposed to market risk associated with changes in FX rates primarily related to the euro and GBP. Under the Companys current FX hedging program, the Company hedges a portion of FX currency risk for MOODYS 2009 10 K 43 Table of Contents the purpose of reducing volatility in the Companys cash flows related to future euro and GBP billings and related revenue. FX options and forwards are currently utilized to hedge these exposures and as of December 31, 2009 have maturities between one and 11 months. As of December 2009 all FX derivative contracts were deemed to be highly effective under Topic 815 of the ASC. No credit losses are anticipated as the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions and the Company adheres to strict guidelines regarding the creditworthiness of its counterparties. The fair value of the Companys outstanding FX derivative contracts was recorded within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consisted of the following notional amounts: December 31, 2009 2008 Notional amount of Currency Pair: GBP/USD &pound; 5.0 &pound; 7.4 EUR/USD 9.9 12.9 EUR/GBP 21.0 24.3 Fair value of derivative asset $ 1.2 $ 4.9 Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and, once realized, the gains or losses will be recognized as an adjustment to revenue when the billings are recognized in revenue. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the FX rates on Moodys FX options. A hypothetical 10% favorable change in the overall option currency portfolio would result in a gain of approximately $2.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The maximum loss related to an adverse change in the option currency portfolio would be $2.4 million. As a result of the 2008 Term Loan completed on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR based variable interest rate. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded into AOCI, while net interest payments are recorded in the statement of operations. At December 31, 2009 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $7.6 million and is recorded in other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moodys uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing this objective. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the short term LIBOR on Moodys interest expense relating to the 2008 Term Loan, assuming the interest rate swap was not in place. A hypothetical change of one percent in the LIBOR would result in an impact on annual interest expense of approximately $1.5 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and from financing activities. The Company had net repayments on borrowings of $274.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The following is a summary of the change in the Companys cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes: Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change 2008 2007 $ Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 643.8 $ 539.7 $ 104.1 $ 539.7 $ 988.2 $ (448.5 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (93.8 ) $ (319.3 ) $ 225.5 $ (319.3 ) $ (124.7 ) $ (194.6 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (348.8 ) $ (349.8 ) $ 1.0 $ (349.8 ) $ (865.7 ) $ 515.9 Net cash provided by operating activities Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The following changes in non cash and other one time items impacted cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008, relative to net income: An $11.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due primarily to the following items in 2008: an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangibles within the MA segment, a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology relating to the Fermat acquisition and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of the Companys New Jersey office. These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets in 2009 associated with business acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2008. A $7.8 million non cash reduction related to the resolution of a Legacy Tax Matter in the second quarter of 2008; 44 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents A $33.8 million increase in deferred income tax expense primarily relating to the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001 2007 tax years. The $104.1 million increase of net cash flows provided by operating activities resulted from changes in assets and liabilities discussed below and the change in the non cash items discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $54.5 million: A $168.8 million increase attributed to a reduction in 2009 payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflecting lower 2008 incentive compensation payouts made in the first quarter of 2009 due to weaker financial performance compared to targets in 2008 compared to 2007 as well as lower accrued taxes resulting primarily from the decrease in pre tax income; A $32.4 million increase relating to the $17.5 million restructuring charge taken in 2009, of which $5 million has not been paid, coupled with lower restructuring payments in 2009 compared to 2008 attributable to the 2007 Restructuring Plan; A $78.4 million increase due to a reduction in other current assets primarily due to a reduction in prepaid taxes which were used for 2009 estimated income tax payments; An increase in the growth of deferred rent of approximately $15 million due primarily to a free rent period associated with the Canary Wharf lease; Partially offset by: A $45.4 million decrease from other liabilities primarily reflecting a $17 million payment for interest to settle a tax audit for the 2001 2007 tax years and a $12 million reduction to accrued interest for UTBs; A decrease of approximately $33 million due to a refund of a deposit from the IRS in March 2008 in connection with a Legacy Tax Matter; A $51.8 million decrease in UTBs primarily related to a payment for the settlement of a tax audit for the 2001 2007 tax years; A $41.1 million decrease relating to 5% higher accounts receivable from December 31, 2008 reflecting higher billings related to the gradual improvement in the credit markets during 2009 compared to a 5% decrease in the December 31, 2008 balance compared to the prior year reflecting lower billings in the later part of 2008 compared to 2009. Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 The following changes in non cash and other one time items impacted cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007, relative to net income: A $27.0 million decrease in stock based compensation expense primarily reflecting the 2007 restructuring actions; A $32.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due primarily to an approximate $11 million impairment of certain software and database intangibles within the MA segment, approximately $6 million relating to the acquisition of Fermat including a $4.5 million write off of acquired in process technology, approximately $6 million reflecting the use of 7WTC for the full year of 2008 and approximately $4 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of the Companys New Jersey office in the second quarter of 2008; A $44.7 million decrease in Excess Tax Benefits due to fewer stock option exercises; A $44.5 million decrease of an accrual for Legacy Tax Matters in 2007 compared to 2008; A $59.1 million decrease in deferred income taxes due to lower restructuring, tenant allowances, and deferred revenue in 2008. The $448.5 million reduction of net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributed to a decrease in net income of $245.2 million, adjusted for the non cash and other one time items discussed above, and the following changes in assets and liabilities: A decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $172.3 million, comprised of approximately $111 million of accrued taxes relating to lower pre tax income and the timing of payments and approximately $30 million related to lower annual incentive compensation accruals reflecting weak financial performance; A decrease in deferred revenue of $70.2 million as a result of lower billings reflecting the weak credit market conditions; A decrease of $62.9 million in the restructuring liability relating to payments made during the year and other minor adjustments; A decrease in the growth of deferred rent of $46.5 million due primarily to a tenant allowance received in 2007 relating to 7WTC; MOODYS 2009 10 K 45 Table of Contents An increase of approximately $33 million for a deposit returned from the IRS in March 2008 in connection with a Legacy Tax Matter. A $61.1 million decrease in UTBs and other non current tax liabilities due primarily to the implementation of UTP guidance in 2007; Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The $225.5 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to: A $240.5 million decrease in net cash used resulting from the 2008 acquisitions of Fermat, BQuotes, Financial Projections Limited and Enb Consulting. Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 The $194.6 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to: A $237.0 million increase in net cash used resulting from the 2008 acquisitions of Fermat, BQuotes, Financial Projections Limited and Enb Consulting; A $55.9 million decrease of net cash provided by short term investments in 2008 following the liquidation of a majority of the portfolio in 2007 to finance share repurchases and other operational activities, Partially offset by: A $97.4 million decrease in capital additions resulting from reduced 7WTC build out activity in 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash used in financing activities Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The $1.0 million decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily attributed to: A $592.9 million decrease in treasury shares repurchased in 2009 compared to 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares during 2009; Partially offset by: Net repayments of $274.0 million on short term borrowings resulting from the Company utilizing operating cash flow to repay outstanding borrowings in 2009 compared to net borrowings of $166.3 million in 2008; A $150.0 million decrease relating to proceeds received in May 2008 from the 2008 Term Loan. Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 The $515.9 million decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily attributed to: A $1,145.5 million decrease in treasury shares repurchased in 2008 compared to 2007, A $44.7 million decrease in Excess Tax Benefits due to fewer stock option exercises; Partially offset by: A $381.1 million net increase in short term borrowings under the Companys CP program and revolving credit facilities, the proceeds of which were used to fund share repurchases and other operational and investing activities; A $150.0 million increase in long term debt resulting from the issuance of the 2008 Term Loan compared to $300.0 million received in 2007 from the issuance of the Series 2007 1 Notes. Future Cash Requirements The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources. The Company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions in related businesses, repurchasing stock and paying a modest dividend. In the near term, Moodys intends to maintain its dividend and has commenced a modest share repurchase program, the continuation of which is dependent on Moodys liquidity and 46 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents market conditions. As of December 31, 2009 Moodys had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program, which does not have an established expiration. At December 31, 2009 the Company had total borrowings outstanding from its CP Program of $443.7 million, the proceeds of which were or will be used to support the remaining build out of Moodys Canary Wharf location, potential acquisitions, share repurchases and other operational and investing activities. At December 31, 2009, Moodys had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt with approximately $556 million of additional capacity available. Principal payments on the 2008 Term Loan commenced in September 2010 and will continue through its maturity in accordance with the schedule of payments outlined in Note 14 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. On March 27, 2009 the Company approved the 2009 Restructuring Plan to reduce costs in response to a strategic review of its business in certain jurisdictions and weak global economic and market conditions. This resulted in a restructuring charge of $15.6 million, all of which was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. The remaining liability of $5 million will result in cash outlays that will be substantially paid out over the next twelve months. On February 6, 2008, the Company entered into a 17.5 year operating lease agreement to occupy six floors of an office tower located in the Canary Wharf district of London, England. The total base rent of the Canary Wharf Lease over its 17.5 year term is approximately 134 million GBP, and the Company will begin making base rent payments in 2011. In addition to the base rent payments the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for its share of operating expenses and tax obligation. For periods subsequent to December 31, 2009 the Company expects to incur approximately 17 million GBP of costs to build out the floors to its specifications, substantially all of which is expected to be incurred over the next twelve months. On December 31, 2007, the Company approved the 2007 Restructuring Plan that would reduce global head count, terminate certain technology contracts and consolidate certain corporate functions in response to both the Companys Reorganization announced on August 7, 2007 as well as a decline in the then current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors. Included in the $50.0 million restructuring charge reported in 2007 is $7.0 million of non cash settlements relating to pension curtailments and stock based compensation award modifications for certain terminated employees. At December 31, 2009, the remaining cash payments of approximately $1 million are expected to be paid over the next twelve months and the remaining liability of approximately $8 million, which relates to the Companys unfunded pension plans, will be paid in accordance with plan provisions. The amount to be paid over the next twelve months relating to these pension liabilities is not expected to be material. On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moodys headquarters. The 7WTC Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the 7WTC Lease over its initial 21 year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. On March 28, 2007, the 7WTC lease agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square feet at 7WTC. The additional base rent is approximately $106 million over a 20 year term. The total remaining lease payments as of December 31, 2009, including the aforementioned rent credits, are approximately $585 million. The Company also intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 15, 2009, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of 10.5 cents per share of Moodys common stock, payable on March 10, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2010. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the Legacy Tax Matters that are discussed in this MD&A under Contingencies. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. MOODYS 2009 10 K 47 Table of Contents Indebtedness The following table summarizes total indebtedness: December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Facility $ $ 613.0 Commercial paper, net of unamortized discount of $0.1 million at 2009 and $0.3 million at 2008 443.7 104.7 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 3.8 Notes payable: Series 2005 1 Notes 300.0 300.0 Series 2007 1 Notes 300.0 300.0 2008 Term Loan 146.2 150.0 Total Debt 1,193.7 1,467.7 Current portion (447.5 ) (717.7 ) Total long term debt $ 746.2 $ 750.0 2007 Facility On September 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion five year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. The 2007 Facility will serve, in part, to support the Companys CP Program described below. Interest on borrowings is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the outstanding borrowing amount depending on the Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points per annum of the facility amount, depending on the Companys Debt/EBITDA ratio. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 5.0 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as December 31, 2008 was 1.47%. The 2007 Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The 2007 Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Commercial Paper On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re borrowed. The CP Program is supported by the Companys 2007 Facility. The maturities of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The weighted average interest rate on CP borrowings outstanding was 0.3% and 2.08% as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The CP Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non payment of principal, interest or fees; violation of covenants; invalidity of any loan document; material judgments; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. Notes Payable On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007 1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 pursuant to the 2007 Agreement. The Series 2007 1 Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi annually on March 7 and September 7. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007 1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Make Whole Amount. The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create liens, enter into any sale leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its Debt/EBITDA ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. 48 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents On September 30, 2005, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005 1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015 pursuant to the 2005 Agreement. The Series 2005 1 Notes have a ten year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi annually on March 30 and September 30. Proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005 1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.61% senior notes which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moodys pays all, or part, of the Series 2005 1 Notes in advance of their maturity, such prepayment will be subject to a Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005 1 Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. 2008 Term Loan On May 7, 2008, Moodys entered into a five year, $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan with several lenders. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off a portion of the CP outstanding. Interest on borrowings under the 2008 Term Loan is payable quarterly at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a margin that can range from 125 basis points to 175 basis points depending on the Companys Debt/EBITDA ratio. The outstanding borrowings shall amortize beginning in 2010 in accordance with the schedule of payments set forth in the 2008 Term Loan outlined in the table below. The 2008 Term Loan contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company to engage or to permit its subsidiaries to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale leaseback transactions or to incur, or permit its subsidiaries to incur, liens, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 2008 Term Loan also limits the amount of debt that subsidiaries of the Company may incur. In addition, the 2008 Term Loan contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Debt/EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The principal payments due on the 2008 Term Loan through its maturity are as follows: Year Ending December 31, 2010 $ 3.8 2011 11.3 2012 71.2 2013 63.7 Total $ 150.0 Also, on May 7, 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to protect against fluctuations in the LIBOR based variable interest rate on the 2008 Term Loan as more fully discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest (Expense) Income, Net The following table summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Income $ 2.5 $ 18.1 $ 19.3 Expense on borrowings (45.5 ) (60.0 ) (40.7 ) UTBs and other tax related interest 1.6 (13.7 ) (21.5 ) Reversal of accrued interest (a) 6.5 2.3 17.5 Interest capitalized 1.5 1.1 1.1 Total $ (33.4 ) $ (52.2 ) $ (24.3 ) Interest paid $ 46.1 $ 59.5 $ 32.5 (a) Represents a reduction of accrued interest related to the favorable resolution of Legacy Tax Matters, further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. In addition to the covenants described above, the 2007 Facility, the 2005 Agreement, the 2007 Agreement and the 2008 Term Loan contain cross default provisions whereby default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. MOODYS 2009 10 K 49 Table of Contents The Companys long term debt, including the current portion, is recorded at cost. The fair value and carrying value of the Companys long term debt as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 CarryingAmount Estimated FairValue CarryingAmount Estimated FairValue Series 2005 1 Notes $ 300.0 $ 291.1 $ 300.0 $ 271.9 Series 2007 1 Notes 300.0 298.6 300.0 278.1 2008 Term Loan 150.0 150.0 150.0 150.0 Total $ 750.0 $ 739.7 $ 750.0 $ 700.0 The fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on prevailing interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar maturities. Management may consider pursuing additional long term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2009, Moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Indebtedness (1) $ 1,447.1 $ 486.9 $ 159.9 $ 130.7 $ 669.6 Operating lease obligations 905.2 57.9 105.9 108.9 632.5 Purchase obligations (2) 129.0 68.9 43.4 16.7 Pension obligations (3) 74.2 8.8 11.5 7.4 46.5 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 Total (4) $ 2,556.8 $ 623.8 $ 320.7 $ 263.7 $ 1,348.6 (1) Reflects principal payments, related interest and applicable fees due on the 2008 Term Loan, the Series 2005 1 Notes, the Series 2007 1 Notes, borrowings under the CP Program and the 2007 Facility, as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

(3) Reflects projected benefit payments for the next ten years relating to the Companys unfunded Post Retirement Benefit Plans described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) The table above does not include the Companys long term tax liabilities of $164.2 million and $52.8 million relating to UTP and Legacy Tax Matters, respectively, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably estimated. 2010 OUTLOOK Moodys outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moodys results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. For Moodys overall, the Company expects full year 2010 revenue to increase in the high single digit percent range. Full year 2010 expenses are also expected to increase in the high single digit percent range. Full year 2010 operating margin is projected in the high thirties percent range and the effective tax rate is expected in the range of 37 to 38 percent. Share repurchase is expected to resume at modest levels in 2010 subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 in the range of $1.75 to $1.85. This outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of year 2009 rates. 50 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2010 is expected to increase in the high single to low double digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the mid teens percent range, while non U.S. revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is expected to increase in the high teens percent range with anticipated growth in speculative grade issuance activity offset by moderation of investment grade issuance from the high volume of 2009. Structured finance revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range reflecting modest growth in most asset classes. Revenue from financial institution ratings is expected to increase in the low single digit percent range, while revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance is expected to increase in the low double digit percent range. For Moodys Analytics, full year 2010 revenue is expected to increase in the mid single digit percent range. Revenue growth is expected in the low single digit percent range for RD&A, the mid teens percent range for RMS, and the high single to low double digit percent range for professional services. MA revenue is expected to increase in the low single digit percent range in the U.S. and in the mid single digit percent range outside the U.S. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Adopted: In December 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires additional disclosures about assets held in an employers defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard as of December 31, 2009 and has presented the required disclosures in the prescribed format in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. This new standard only affected the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements and did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. During the period ending September 30, 2009, the Company adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which only affected the specific references to GAAP literature in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Not yet adopted: In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new standard eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. The Company will adopt this new accounting standard as of January 1, 2010 and does not expect the implementation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 13, "Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("ASU 2009 13"). The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price ("VSOE") if available, third party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2009 13 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after January 1, 2010. If applied in the same manner to the year ended December 31, 2009, ASU 2009 13 would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its MIS and MA segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 is also not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on its current pricing strategies. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. The new standard requires disclosure regarding transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 classifications within the fair value hierarchy as well as requiring further detail of activity within the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy. The new standard also requires disclosures regarding the fair value for each class of assets and liabilities, which is a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in a companys balance sheet. Additionally, the standard will require further disclosures surrounding inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the implementation of ASU No. 2010 06 on its consolidated financial statements. CONTINGENCIES From time to time, Moodys is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental investigations, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Companys business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moodys is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Companys liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moodys discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate. MOODYS 2009 10 K 51 Table of Contents Following the events in the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly over the last two years, MIS and other credit rating agencies are the subject of intense scrutiny, increased regulation, ongoing investigation, and civil litigation. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are considering additional legislation, regulation and enforcement actions, including with respect to MISs compliance with newly imposed regulatory standards. Moodys has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is responding to such investigations and inquiries. Moodys is cooperating with a review by the SEC relating to errors in the model used by MIS to rate certain constant proportion debt obligations. In addition, the Company is facing market participant litigation relating to the performance of MIS rated securities. Although Moodys in the normal course experiences such litigation, the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment. On June 27, 2008, the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The plaintiff asserts various causes of action relating to the named defendants oversight of MISs ratings of RMBS and constant proportion debt obligations, and their participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about MISs ratings practices and or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief. On July 2, 2008, Thomas R. Flynn, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, filed a similar purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain senior officers, and the Company as nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, asserting similar claims and seeking the same relief. The cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in November 2008. The Company removed the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2008. In January 2009, the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, which the Company opposed. On February 23, 2010, the court issued an opinion remanding the case to the Supreme Court of New York. On October 30, 2008, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System, a purported shareholder of the Companys securities, also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and certain officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. This complaint also asserts various causes of action relating to the Companys ratings of RMBS, CDO and constant proportion debt obligations, and named defendants participation in the alleged public dissemination of false and misleading information about MISs ratings practices and or a failure to implement internal procedures and controls to prevent the alleged wrongdoing. On December 9, 2008, Rena Nadoff, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and its CEO, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged overrating of asset backed securities and underrating of municipal securities. On October 20, 2009, the Company moved to dismiss or stay the action in favor of related federal litigation. On January 26, 2010, the court entered a stipulation and order, submitted jointly by the parties, staying the Nadoff litigation pending coordination and prosecution of similar claims in the above and below described federal derivative actions. On July 6, 2009, W. A. Sokolowski, a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the Company against its directors and current and former officers, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts claims relating to alleged mismanagement of the Companys processes for rating structured finance transactions, alleged insider trading and causing the Company to buy back its own stock at artificially inflated prices. Two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the Companys securities against the Company and certain of its senior officers, asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The first was filed by Raphael Nach in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 19, 2007. The second was filed by Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 26, 2007. Both actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Moodys Corporation Securities Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 27, 2008, a consolidated amended complaint was filed, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the Companys securities during the period February 3, 2006 through October 24, 2007. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and or misleading statements concerning the Companys business conduct, business prospects, business conditions and financial results relating primarily to MISs ratings of structured finance products including RMBS, CDO and constant proportion debt obligations. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case. The Company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in September 2008. On February 23, 2009, the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims and sustaining others. For claims, litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes 52 MOODYS 2009 10 K Table of Contents available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. The Company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative, regulatory, enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position, financial position or results of operations. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate monetary liability of the Company for the pending matters referred to above (other than the Legacy Tax Matters that are discussed below) is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, although it is possible that the effect could be material to the Companys consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Legacy Tax Matters Moodys continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from Legacy Tax Matters. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $55.8 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000 Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moodys future reported results, financial position and cash flows. The following summary of the relationships among Moodys, New D&B and their predecessor entities is important in understanding our exposure to the Legacy Tax Matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into two separate public companies: Old D&B and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. In September 2000, Old D&B separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moodys. Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Old D&B and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable IRS determinations on certain tax matters, and certain other potential tax liabilities, all as described in such agreements. Further, in connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moodys have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these Legacy Tax Matters. Settlement agreements were executed with the IRS in 2005 regarding the Legacy Tax Matters for the years 1989 1990 and 1993 1996. These settlements represent substantially all of the total potential liability to the IRS, including penalties. As of December 31, 2009, the Company continues to carry a liability of $1.9 million for the remaining potential exposure. In addition, with respect to these settlement agreements, Moodys and New D&B believe that IMS Health and NMR did not pay their full share of the liability to the IRS pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties. Moodys and New D&B paid these amounts to the IRS on their behalf, and attempted to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR. As a result, Moodys and New D&B commenced arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR in connection with the 1989 1990 matter. This matter was resolved during the third quarter of 2008 in favor of Moodys and New D&B, resulting in IMS Health and NMR having paid a total of $6.7 million to Moodys. In the second quarter of 2009, Moodys and New D&B reached a settlement with IMS Health and NMR with respect to the 1993 1996 matter, resulting in $10.8 million of cash proceeds paid to Moodys of which $6.5 million represents interest and $4.3 million is a reduction of tax expense. Amortization Expense Deductions This Legacy Tax Matter, which was affected by developments in June 2007 and 2008 as further described below, involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. IRS audits of Old D&Bs and New D&Bs tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in June 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions, or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction. These audits resulted in the IRS issuing the Notices for other tax issues for the 1997 2000 years aggregating $9.5 million in tax and penalties, plus statutory interest of approximately $6 million, which should be apportioned among Moodys, New D&B, IMS Health and NMR pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements. Moodys share of this assessment was $6.6 million including interest, net of tax. In November 2007, the IRS assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment, together with interest. The Company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the IRSs actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts. The absence of any tax deficiencies in the Notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2002, MOODYS 2009 10 K 53 Table of Contents combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002, for issues not assessed, resulted in Moodys recording an earnings benefit of $52.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. This is comprised of two components, as follows: (i) a reversal of a tax liability of $27.3 million related to the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date, reducing the provision for income taxes; and (ii) a reduction of accrued interest expense of $17.5 million ($10.6 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non operating income of $14.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B. In June 2008, the statute of limitations for New D&B relating to the 2003 tax year expired. As a result, in the second quarter of 2008, Moodys recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of $2.3 million ($1.4 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non operating income of $6.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys carries a liability of $1.1 million with respect to this matter. On the Distribution Date, New D&B paid Moodys $55.0 million for 50% of certain anticipated future tax benefits of New D&B through 2012. It is possible that IRS audits of New D&B for tax years after 2003 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction. In the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by New D&B, or there is an audit adjustment, Moodys would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that New D&B incurs. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys liability with respect to this matter totaled $52.8 million. In March 2006, New D&B and Moodys each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. In July 2007, New D&B and Moodys commenced procedures to recover approximately $57 million of these deposits ($24.6 million for New D&B and $31.9 million for Moodys), which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the Notices. As noted above, in November 2007 the IRS used $7.9 million of Moodys portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008 the IRS returned to Moodys $33.1 million in connection with this matter, which includes $3.0 million of interest. In July 2008, the IRS paid Moodys the remaining $1.8 million balance of the original deposit, and in September 2008 the IRS paid Moodys $0.2 million of interest on that balance.
