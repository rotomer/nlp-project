ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For purposes of this discussion, the term "Company" refers, at all times prior to the date of demutualization (as hereinafter defined), to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("Metropolitan Life"), a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of New York, and its subsidiaries, and at all times on and after the date of demutualization, to MetLife, Inc. (the "Holding Company"), a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan Life. Following this summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. BUSINESS REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company implemented several business realignment initiatives, which resulted from a strategic review of operations and an ongoing commitment to reduce expenses. The impact of these actions on a segment basis is as follows: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 NET OF AMOUNT INCOME TAX (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Institutional............................................... $399 $267 Individual.................................................. 97 61 Auto & Home................................................. 3 2 Total.................................................. $499 $330 Institutional. The charges to this segment include costs associated with exiting a business, including the write off of goodwill, severance, severance related expenses, and facility consolidation costs. These expenses are the result of the discontinuance of certain 401(k) recordkeeping services and externally managed guaranteed index separate accounts. These initiatives will result in the elimination of approximately 450 positions. These actions resulted in charges to policyholder benefits and claims and other expenses of $215 million and $184 million, respectively. 42 Individual. The charges to this segment include facility consolidation costs, severance and severance related expenses, which predominately stem from the elimination of approximately 560 non sales positions and 190 operations and technology positions supporting this segment. The costs were recorded in other expenses. Auto & Home. The charges to this segment include severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 200 positions. The costs were recorded in other expenses. These initiatives are expected to result in savings of approximately $100 million, net of income tax, during 2002, comprised of approximately $60 million, $35 million and $5 million in the Individual, Institutional and Auto & Home segments, respectively. Although many of the segments underlying business initiatives were completed in 2001, a portion of the activity will continue into 2002. The liability related to business initiatives at December 31, 2001 was $295 million. SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TRAGEDIES On September 11, 2001 a terrorist attack occurred in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania (collectively, the "tragedies") triggering a significant loss of life and property which had an adverse impact on certain of the Companys businesses. The Company has direct exposures to this event with claims arising from its Individual, Institutional, Reinsurance and Auto & Home insurance coverages, although it believes the majority of such claims have been reported or otherwise analyzed by the Company. As of December 31, 2001, the Companys estimate of the total expected insurance losses related to the tragedies is $208 million, net of income tax of $117 million. This estimate is subject to revision in subsequent periods, as claims are received from insureds and the claims to reinsurers are identified and processed. Any revision to the estimate of gross losses and reinsurance recoveries in subsequent periods will affect income before income taxes and net income in such periods. Reinsurance recoveries are dependent on the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers, which may be adversely affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with the tragedies. The long term effects of the tragedies on the Companys businesses cannot be assessed at this time. The tragedies have had significant adverse effects on general economic, market and political conditions, increasing many of the Companys business risks. This may have a negative effect on the Companys businesses and results of operations over time. In particular, the declines in share prices experienced after the reopening of the United States equity markets following the tragedies have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to a decline in separate account assets, which in turn could have an adverse effect on fees earned in the Companys businesses. In addition, the Institutional segment may receive disability claims from individuals suffering from mental and nervous disorders resulting from the tragedies. This may lead to a revision in the Companys estimated insurance losses related to the tragedies. The majority of the Companys disability policies include the provision that such claims be submitted within two years of the traumatic event. The Companys general account investment portfolios include investments, primarily comprised of fixed income securities, in industries that were affected by the tragedies, including airline, insurance, other travel and lodging and insurance. Exposures to these industries also exist through mortgage loans and investments in real estate. The market value of the Companys investment portfolio exposed to industries affected by the tragedies was approximately $3.0 billion at December 31, 2001. THE DEMUTUALIZATION On April 7, 2000 (the "date of demutualization"), pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance (the "Superintendent") approving its plan of reorganization, as amended (the "plan"), Metropolitan Life converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company. In conjunction therewith, each policyholders membership interest was extinguished and each eligible policyholder received, in exchange for that interest, trust interests representing shares of Common Stock held in the MetLife Policyholder Trust, cash or an adjustment to their policy values in the form of policy credits, as provided in the plan. In addition, Metropolitan Lifes Canadian branch made cash 43 payments to holders of certain policies transferred to Clarica Life Insurance Company in connection with the sale of a substantial portion of Metropolitan Lifes Canadian operations in 1998, as a result of a commitment made in connection with obtaining Canadian regulatory approval of that sale. The payments, which were recorded in the second quarter of 2000, were determined in a manner that was consistent with the treatment of, and fair and equitable to, eligible policyholders of Metropolitan Life. On the date of demutualization, the Holding Company conducted an initial public offering of 202,000,000 shares of its Common Stock and concurrent private placements of an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares of its Common Stock at an offering price of $14.25 per share. The shares of Common Stock issued in the offerings are in addition to 494,466,664 shares of Common Stock of the Holding Company distributed to the Metropolitan Life Policyholder Trust for the benefit of policyholders of Metropolitan Life in connection with the demutualization. On April 10, 2000, the Holding Company issued 30,300,000 additional shares of its Common Stock as a result of the exercise of over allotment options granted to underwriters in the initial public offering. Concurrently with these offerings, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business trust wholly owned by MetLife, Inc., issued 20,125,000 8.00% equity security units for an aggregate offering price of $1,006 million. Each unit consists of (i) a contract to purchase shares of Common Stock and (ii) a capital security of MetLife Capital Trust I. On the date of demutualization, Metropolitan Life established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of Metropolitan Life. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS In November 2001, the Company acquired Compania de Seguros de Vida Santander S.A. and Compania de Reaseguaros de Vida Soince Re S. A., wholly owned subsidiaries of Santander Central Hispano in Chile (collectively, the "Chilean acquisitions"). These acquisitions mark MetLifes entrance into the Chilean insurance market and the newest addition to the Companys Latin American operations. In July 2001, the Company completed its sale of Conning Corporation ("Conning"), an affiliate acquired in the acquisition of GenAmerica. In May 2001, the Company acquired Seguradora America Do Sul S.A. ("Seasul"), a life and pension company in Brazil. Seasul is being integrated into MetLifes wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Seguros e Previdencia Privada S.A, or MetLife Brazil. In February 2001, the Holding Company consummated the purchase of Grand Bank, N.A. ("Grand Bank"). Grand Bank provides banking services to individuals and small businesses in the Princeton, New Jersey area. On February 12, 2001, the Federal Reserve Board approved the Holding Companys application for bank holding company status and to become a financial holding company upon its acquisition of Grand Bank. During the second half of 2000, Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated ("RGA") acquired the interest in RGA Financial Group, LLC it did not already own. In October 2000, the Company completed the sale of its 48% ownership interest in its affiliates, Nvest, L.P. and Nvest Companies L.P. In July 2000, the Company acquired the workplace benefits division of Business Mens Assurance Company ("BMA"), a Kansas City, Missouri based insurer. In April 2000, Metropolitan Life acquired the outstanding shares of Conning common stock not already owned by Metropolitan Life. In January 2000, Metropolitan Life completed its acquisition of GenAmerica for $1.2 billion. As part of the GenAmerica acquisition, General American Life Insurance Company paid Metropolitan Life a fee of $120 million in connection with the assumption of certain funding agreements. The fee was considered part of the purchase price of GenAmerica. GenAmerica is a holding company which included General American Life Insurance Company, 49% of the outstanding shares of RGA common stock, and 61.0% of the outstanding shares of Conning common stock, which was subsequently sold in 2001. Metropolitan Life owned 9% of the outstanding shares of RGA common stock prior to the completion of the GenAmerica acquisition. At 44 December 31, 2001 Metropolitan Lifes ownership percentage of the outstanding shares of RGA common stock was approximately 58%. On January 30, 2002, MetLife, Inc. and its affiliated companies announced their intention to purchase up to $125 million of RGAs outstanding common stock over an unspecified period of time. These purchases are intended to offset potential future dilution of the Companys holding of RGAs common stock arising from the issuance by RGA of company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts on December 10, 2001. In November 1999, the Company acquired the individual disability income business of Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. In September 1999, the Auto & Home segment acquired the standard personal lines property and casualty insurance operations of The St. Paul Companies. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies and related judgments underlying the Companys consolidated financial statements are summarized below. In applying these policies, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Companys businesses and operations. The Companys general policies are described in detail in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. INVESTMENTS The Companys principal investments are in fixed maturities, mortgage loans and real estate, all of which are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk: credit, interest rate and market valuation. The financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of income, impairments and the determination of fair values. In addition, the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets. DERIVATIVES The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions to manage the risk associated with variability in cash flows related to the Companys financial assets and liabilities or to changing fair values. The Company also purchases investment securities and issues certain insurance policies with embedded derivatives. The associated financial statement risk is the volatility in net income, which can result from (i) changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges, and (ii) ineffectiveness of designated hedges in an environment of changing interest rates or fair values. In addition, accounting for derivatives is complex, as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standards which continue to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in determining fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS The Company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new insurance business. These costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business, are deferred. The recovery of such costs is dependent on the future profitability of the related business. The amount of future profit is dependent principally on investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, expenses to administer the business and certain economic variables, such as inflation. These factors enter into managements estimates of gross margins and profits which generally are used to amortize certain of such costs. Revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross margins and profits are less than amounts deferred. 45 FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS The Company also establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance, annuities and disabled lives. Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing of the products. Principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns and inflation. Differences between the actual experience and assumptions used in pricing the policies and in the establishment of liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The Company establishes liabilities for unpaid claims and claims expenses for property and casualty insurance. Pricing of this insurance takes into account the expected frequency and severity of losses, the costs of providing coverage, competitive factors, characteristics of the property covered and the insured, and profit considerations. Liabilities for property and casualty insurance are dependent on estimates of amounts payable for claims reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are influenced by historical experience and actuarial assumptions of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management strategies. REINSURANCE Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business. The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish policy benefits. Additionally, for each of its reinsurance contracts, the Company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company must review all contractual features, particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the Company is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If the Company determines that a contract does not expose it to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the contract on a deposit method of accounting. LITIGATION The Company is a party to a number of legal actions. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on the Companys consolidated financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty around numerous variables used to determine amounts recorded. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have an adverse effect upon the Companys operating results or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. See "Legal Proceedings." 46 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents consolidated financial information for the years indicated: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $17,212 $16,317 $12,088 Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 1,889 1,820 1,433 Net investment income................................... 11,923 11,768 9,816 Other revenues.......................................... 1,507 2,229 1,861 Net investment losses (net of amounts allocable to other accounts of $(134), $(54) and $(67), respectively)....

This variance is attributable to increases in the Institutional, Reinsurance, International and Auto & Home segments, partially offset by a decrease in the Individual segment. An improvement of $388 million in the Institutional segment is predominately the result of sales growth and continued favorable policyholder retention in this segments dental, disability and long term care businesses. In addition, significant premiums received from several existing group life customers in 2001 and the BMA acquisition in 2000 resulted in higher premiums. The 2000 balance includes $124 million in additional insurance coverages purchased by existing customers with funds received in the demutualization and significant premiums received from existing retirement and savings customers. New premiums from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business all contributed to the $312 million premium growth in the Reinsurance segment. A $186 million rise in the International segment is due to growth in Mexico, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan, as well as acquisitions in Brazil and Chile. These variances were partially offset by a decline in Argentinean individual life premiums, reflecting the impact of recent economic and political events in that country. If these conditions continue, management expects further declines in Argentinean premiums. Higher average premium resulting from rate increases is the primary driver of a $119 million rise in the Auto & Home segment. A $110 million decline in the Individual segment is attributable to lower sales of traditional life insurance policies, which reflects a continued shift in customer preference from those policies to variable life products. 47 Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $69 million, or 4%, to $1,889 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,820 million for the comparable 2000 period. This variance is due to increases in the Institutional and Individual segments, partially offset by a decline in the International segment. Growth in sales and deposits of group universal life and corporate owned life insurance products resulted in a $45 million increase in the Institutional segment. A $39 million rise in the Individual segment is predominately the result of higher fees from variable life products reflecting a shift in customer preferences from traditional life products. A decrease of $15 million in the International segment is primarily due to reduced fees in Spain resulting from fewer assets under management. This is a result of a planned cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A. ("Banco Santander"). Net investment income increased by $155 million, or 1%, to $11,923 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $11,768 million for the comparable 2000 period. This change is due to higher income from (i) mortgage loans on real estate of $155 million, or 9%, (ii) other invested assets of $87 million, or 54%, (iii) fixed maturities of $36 million, or less than 1%, and (iv) interest on policy loans of $21 million, or 4%. These positive variances are partially offset by lower income from (i) equity securities and other limited partnership interests of $86 million, or 47%, (ii) real estate and real estate joint ventures, net of investment expenses and depreciation, of $45 million, or 7%, and (iii) cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $9 million, or 3%, and higher investment expenses of $4 million, or 2%. The increase in income from mortgage loans on real estate to $1,848 million in 2001 from $1,693 million in 2000 is predominately the result of higher mortgage production volume and increases in mortgage prepayment fees and contingent interest. Income from other invested assets increased to $249 million in 2001 from $162 million in 2000 primarily due to the reclassification of $19 million from other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges, $24 million from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges and the recognition in 2000 of a $20 million loss on an equity method investment. The improvement in income from fixed maturities to $8,574 million in 2001 from $8,538 million in 2000 is primarily due to bond prepayments and increased securities lending activity, offset by lower yields on re investments. The expense associated with securities lending activity is included in other expenses. The reduction of income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests to $97 million in 2001 from $183 million in 2000 is primarily due to fewer sales of underlying assets held in corporate partnerships and increased partnership write downs. The decrease in income from real estate and real estate joint ventures to $584 million in 2001 from $629 million in 2000 is primarily due to a decline in hotel occupancy rates and reduced real estate joint venture sales. The increase in net investment income is largely attributable to positive variances in the Institutional and Individual segments, partially offset by a decline in Corporate & Other. Net investment income for the Institutional and Individual segments grew by $202 million and $37 million, respectively. These increases are predominately due to a higher volume of securities lending activity, increases in bond and mortgage prepayments and higher contingent interest on mortgages. The decrease in Corporate & Other is principally the result of sales in 2000 of underlying assets held in corporate limited partnerships. The remainder of the variance is attributable to smaller fluctuations in the other segments. Other revenues decreased by $722 million, or 32%, to $1,507 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2,229 million for the comparable 2000 period. This variance is mainly attributable to reductions in the Asset Management, Individual and Auto & Home segments, partially offset by an increase in the Reinsurance segment. The sales of Nvest and Conning on October 30, 2000 and July 2, 2001, respectively, are the primarily drivers of a $562 million decline in the Asset Management segment. A decrease of $155 million in the Individual segment is primarily due to reduced commission and fee income associated with lower sales in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries which was a result of the equity market downturn. Such commission and fee income can fluctuate consistent with movements in the equity market. Auto & Homes other revenues are lower by $18 million primarily due to a revision of an estimate made in 2000 of amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to the disposition of this segments reinsurance business in 1990. Other revenues in the Reinsurance segment improved by $13 million due to an increase in fees earned on financial reinsurance, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest in RGA Financial Group, LLC during the second half of 2000. 48 The Companys investment gains and losses are net of related policyholder amounts. The amounts netted against investment gains and losses are (i) deferred policy acquisition amortization, to the extent that such amortization results from investment gains and losses, (ii) additions to participating contractholder accounts when amounts equal to such investment gains and losses are credited to the contractholders accounts, and (iii) adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. Net investment losses grew by $213 million, or 55%, to $603 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $390 million for the comparable 2000 period. This increase reflects total gross investment losses of $737 million, an increase of $293 million, or 66%, from $444 million in 2000, before offsets for: the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $(25) million and $95 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively; changes in policyholder dividend obligation of $159 million and $85 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively; and additions to participating contracts of $126 million in 2000. Excluding the net gain on the sale of a subsidiary, net investment losses decreased from the prior year. The Company continues to recognize deteriorating credits through the proactive sale of certain assets. The Company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its operating performance. Investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers. The Company believes its presentation enables readers of its consolidated statements of income to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its operating performance. The Companys presentation of investment gains and losses, net of related policyholder amounts, may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies and, therefore, amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers. Policyholder benefits and claims rose by $1,561 million, or 9%, to $18,454 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $16,893 million for the comparable 2000 period. This variance reflects total gross policyholder benefits and claims of $18,295 million, an increase of $1,361 million, or 8%, from $16,934 million in 2000, before the offsets for reductions in participating contractholder accounts of $126 million in 2000 and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation of $159 million and $(85) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, directly related to net investment losses. The net variance in policyholder benefits and claims is mainly attributable to increases in the Institutional, Reinsurance, Individual, International and Auto & Home segments. Claims related to the September 11, 2001 tragedies and fourth quarter business realignment initiatives account for $291 million and $215 million, respectively, of a $746 million increase in the Institutional segment. The remainder of the fluctuation is attributable to growth in the group life, dental, disability and long term care insurance businesses, commensurate with the variance in premiums, partially offset by a decrease in policyholder benefits and claims related to the retirement and savings business. Policyholder benefits and claims for the Reinsurance segment rose by $388 million due to unfavorable mortality experience in the first and fourth quarters of 2001, as well as adverse results on the reinsurance of Argentine pension business, reflecting the impact of recent economic and political events in that country. In addition, reinsurance claims arising from the September 11, 2001 tragedies of approximately $16 million, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, contributed to the variance. A $179 million rise in the Individual segment is primarily the result of an increase in the liabilities for future policy benefits commensurate with the aging of the in force block of business. In addition, an increase of $74 million in the policyholder dividend obligation and $24 million in liabilities and claims associated with the September 11, 2001 tragedies contributed to the variance. International policyholder benefits and claims increased by $127 million as a result of growth in Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as acquisitions in Brazil and Chile. These fluctuations are partially offset by a decline in Argentina, reflecting the impact of recent economic and political events in that country. A $116 million increase in the Auto & Home segment is predominately the result of increased average claim costs, growth in the auto business and increased non catastrophe weather related losses. Interest credited to policyholder account balances grew by $149 million, or 5%, to $3,084 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2,935 million for the comparable 2000 period, primarily due to an increase of $218 million in the Individual segment, partially offset by a $77 million reduction in the Institutional segment. The establishment of a policyholder liability of $118 million with respect to certain group annuity contracts at New England Financial is the primary driver of the fluctuation in Individual. In addition, higher average 49 policyholder account balances and slightly increased crediting rates contributed to the variance. The decrease in the Institutional segment is primarily due to an overall decline in crediting rates in 2001 as a result of the current interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in average customer account balances stemming from asset growth. The remaining variance is due to minor fluctuations in the Reinsurance and International segments. Policyholder dividends increased by $167 million, or 9%, to $2,086 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,919 million for the comparable 2000 period, primarily due to increases of $135 million and $25 million in the Institutional and Individual segments, respectively. The rise in the Institutional segment is primarily attributed to favorable experience on a large group life contract in 2001. Policyholder dividends vary from period to period based on participating contract experience. The change in the Individual segment reflects growth in the assets supporting policies associated with this segments aging block of traditional life insurance business. The remaining variance is due to minor fluctuations in the International and Reinsurance segments. Payments of $327 million were made during the second quarter of 2000, as part of Metropolitan Lifes demutualization, to holders of certain policies transferred to Clarica Life Insurance Company in connection with the sale of a substantial portion of the Canadian operations in 1998. Demutualization costs of $230 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2000. These costs are related to Metropolitan Lifes demutualization on April 7, 2000. Other expenses decreased by $459 million, or 6%, to $7,565 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $8,024 million for the comparable 2000 period. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which are discussed below, other expenses declined by $218 million, or 3%, to $8,191 million in 2001 from $8,409 million in 2000. This variance is attributable to reductions in the Asset Management, Individual and Auto & Home segments, partially offset by increases in the other segments. A decrease of $532 million in the Asset Management segment is predominately the result of the sales of Nvest and Conning on October 30, 2000 and July 2, 2001, respectively. The Individual segments expenses declined by $167 million due to continued expense management, primarily due to reduced employee costs and lower discretionary spending. In addition, there were reductions in volume related commission expenses in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries and rebate expenses associated with the Companys securities lending program. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. These items are partially offset by an increase of $97 million related to fourth quarter 2001 business realignment initiatives. A $34 million decrease in Auto & Home is attributable to a reduction in integration costs associated with the acquisition of the standard personal lines property and casualty insurance operations of The St. Paul Companies in September 1999 ("St. Paul acquisition"). An increase of $232 million in Institutional expenses is primarily driven by expenses associated with fourth quarter business realignment initiatives of $184 million and a rise in non deferrable variable expenses associated with premium growth in the group insurance businesses. Non deferrable variable expenses include premium tax, commissions and administrative expenses for dental, disability and long term care businesses. These increases are partially offset by a decline in rebate expenses associated with the Companys securities lending program. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. Other expenses in Corporate & Other grew by $219 million primarily due to a $250 million race conscious underwriting loss provision which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, as well as $29 million of additional expenses associated with MetLife, Inc. shareholder services costs and start up costs relating to MetLifes banking initiatives. These increases are partially offset by a $58 million decline in interest expense due to reduced average levels of borrowing and a lower interest rate environment in 2001. An increase of $43 million in the International segment is predominately the result of growth in Mexico and South Korea, and acquisitions in Brazil and Chile, partially offset by a decrease in Spains other expenses due to a planned cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander. The acquisition of the remaining interest in RGA Financial Group, LLC during the second half of 2000 contributed to the $20 million increase in other expenses in the Reinsurance segment. Deferred policy acquisition costs are principally amortized in proportion to gross margins or profits, including investment gains or losses. The amortization is allocated to investment gains and losses to provide consolidated statement of income information regarding the impact of investment gains and losses on the amount of the amortization, and other expenses to provide amounts related to gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. 50 Capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to $2,039 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,863 million for the comparable 2000 period. This variance is attributable to increases in the Individual, Reinsurance, Institutional and International segments. The growth in the Individual segment is primarily due to higher sales of variable and universal life insurance policies and annuity and investment type products, resulting in additional commissions and other deferrable expenses. The increases in the Reinsurance, Institutional and International segments are commensurate with growth in those businesses. Total amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to $1,438 million in 2001 from $1,383 million in 2000. Amortization of $1,413 million and $1,478 million are allocated to other expenses in 2001 and 2000, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment gains and losses. The decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs allocated to other expenses is attributable to a decline in the Individual segment, partially offset by increases in the Reinsurance and International segments. The decline in the Individual segment is due to refinements in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits. Contributing to this variance are modifications made in the third quarter of 2001 relating to the manner in which estimates of future market performance are developed. These estimates are used in determining unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs balances and the amount of related amortization. The modification will reflect an expected impact of past market performance on future market performance, as well as improving the ability to estimate deferred policy acquisition costs balances and related amortization. The increase in the Reinsurance segment is primarily due to fluctuations in allowances paid to ceding companies as a result of a change in product mix. The increase in the International segment is due to a write off of deferred policy acquisition costs as a result of the anticipated impact of recent economic and political events in Argentina. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $266 million, or 36%, of income before provision for income taxes, compared with $463 million, or 33%, for the comparable 2000 period. The 2001 effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35% due to an increase in prior year taxes on capital gains. The 2000 effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the payments made in the second quarter of 2000 to former Canadian policyholders in connection with the demutualization, the impact of surplus tax and a reduction in prior year taxes on capital gains recorded in the third quarter of 2000. This reduction is associated with the previous sale of a business. Prior to its demutualization, the Company was subject to surplus tax imposed on mutual life insurance companies under Section 809 of the Internal Revenue Code. The surplus tax results from the disallowance of a portion of a mutual life insurance companys policyholder dividends as a deduction from taxable income. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 THE COMPANY Premiums increased by $4,229 million, or 35%, to $16,317 million in 2000 from $12,088 million in 1999, in part, due to the acquisition of GenAmerica on January 6, 2000. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, premiums increased by $2,273 million, or 19%. This increase is attributable to Institutional, Auto & Home and International. These increases are partially offset by a $72 million, or 2%, decrease in Individual. The increase of $1,297 million, or 23%, in Institutional is predominantly the result of strong sales and continued favorable policyholder retention in this segments group life, dental and disability businesses. The acquisitions of the workplace benefits division from the BMA acquisition in July 2000 and Lincoln Nationals disability business in November 1999 account for $103 million of the variance. In addition, significant premiums received from existing group life and retirement and savings customers in 2000 contribute $468 million to the variance. The increase of $885 million, or 51%, in Auto & Home is primarily due to the St. Paul acquisition, which represents $755 million of the increase, as well as growth in this segments standard auto business. The increase of $137 million, or 26%, in International is primarily due to overall growth in Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Spain and Brazil. The decrease in Individual is primarily due to a decline in sales of traditional life insurance policies, which reflects a continued shift in policyholders preferences from those policies to variable life products. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $387 million, or 27%, to $1,820 million in 2000 from $1,433 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $145 million, or 10%. This increase is almost entirely attributable to a $130 million, or 15%, increase in Individual, which is primarily due to increased sales, including exchanges, of variable life products, increases in separate account assets and the acceleration of the recognition of unearned fees in connection with a universal life product replacement program. 51 Net investment income increased by $1,952 million, or 20%, to $11,768 million in 2000 from $9,816 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, net investment income increased by $832 million, or 8%. This increase is primarily due to higher income from (i) fixed maturities of $653 million, or 9%, (ii) mortgage loans on real estate of $76 million, or 5%, (iii) interest on policy loans of $17 million, or 5%, (iv) cash and short term investments of $79 million, or 46%, (v) real estate and real estate joint ventures, net of investment expenses and depreciation, of $45 million, or 8%, and (vi) lower investment expenses of $27 million, or 10%. These increases are partially offset by reduced income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests of $54 million, or 23%, and other invested assets of $11 million, or 12%. The increase in income from fixed maturities to $7,824 million in 2000 from $7,171 million in 1999 is primarily due to higher volume in the securities lending program and income from fixed maturities which were part of the St. Paul acquisition in the fourth quarter of 1999. These increases are partially offset by decreases in income from equity linked notes. The increase in income from mortgage loans on real estate to $1,560 million in 2000 from $1,484 million in 1999 is largely due to higher mortgage production volume. The reduction in income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests to $185 million in 2000 from $239 million in 1999 is predominantly the result of a decrease in sales by corporate partnerships. Other revenues increased by $368 million, or 20%, to $2,229 million in 2000 from $1,861 million in 1999. The impact of the GenAmerica acquisition is an increase to other revenues of $363 million. The variance year over year, excluding the impact of GenAmerica, is partially attributable to increases in the Individual, Institutional segments, largely offset by decreases in the Asset Management segment and in Corporate & Other. The increase of $96 million in Individual is largely a result of higher commission and fee income related to increased sales in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries. The primary driver of Institutionals $33 million increase is strong sales growth in its dental and disability administrative services businesses. A $19 million increase in Auto & Home is attributable to a revision of an estimate of amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to the disposition of this segments reinsurance business in 1990. Offsetting these increases is a $122 million decline in the Asset Management segment primarily due to the sale of Nvest, on October 30, 2000. The remaining variance is primarily due to Corporate & Other. The Companys investment gains and losses are net of related policyholder amounts. The amounts netted against investment gains and losses are (i) deferred policy acquisition amortization, to the extent that such amortization results from investment gains and losses, (ii) additions to participating contractholder accounts when amounts equal to such investment gains and losses are credited to the contractholders accounts, and (iii) adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. Net investment losses increased by $320 million, or 457%, to $390 million in 2000 from $70 million in 1999. This increase reflects total gross investment losses of $444 million, an increase of $307 million, or 224%, from $137 million in 1999, before the offsets for: the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $95 million and $46 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively; changes in the policyholder dividend obligation of $85 million in 2000; and (additions to) or reductions in participating contracts of $(126) million and $21 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, related to assets sold. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, net investment losses increased by $378 million, or 540%. This increase reflects the continuation of the Companys strategy to reposition its investment portfolio in order to provide a higher operating return on its invested assets and the recognition of losses through the proactive sale of certain assets. These losses are partially offset by gains of $660 million, including a gain of $663 million, which was recognized as a result of the sale of Nvest on October 30, 2000. The Company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its operating performance. Investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers. The Company believes its presentation enables readers of its consolidated statements of income to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its operating performance. The Companys presentation of investment gains and losses, net of related policyholder amounts, may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies, and therefore, amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers. 52 Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $3,793 million, or 29%, to $16,893 million in 2000 from $13,100 million in 1999. This increase reflects total gross policyholder benefits and claims of $16,934 million, an increase of $3,855 million from $13,079 million in 1999, before the offsets for additions to or (reductions in) participating contractholder accounts of $126 million in 2000 and $(21) million in 1999 and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation of $(85) million in 2000 directly related to net investment losses. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, policyholder benefits and claims increased $2,044 million, or 16%. This rise is primarily due to increases of $1,366 million, or 20%, in Institutional, $704 million, or 54%, in Auto & Home, and $104 million, or 23%, in International. These increases are partially offset by a decrease of $103 million, or 2%, in Individual. The Institutional increase is largely due to overall growth within the segments group dental and disability businesses, as well as the BMA and Lincoln National acquisitions. In addition, policyholder benefits and claims related to the group life and retirement and savings businesses increased commensurate with the premium variance noted above. The increase in Auto & Home is due, in most part, to the St. Paul acquisition, which represents $580 million of the increase. The remainder of the increase is largely attributable to a 9% increase in the number of auto policies in force and increased costs resulting from an increase in the use of original equipment manufacturer parts and higher labor rates. The increase in International is primarily due to overall growth in Mexico, Taiwan, South Korea, Spain and Brazil, commensurate with the increase in Internationals premiums. The decrease in Individual is predominately the result of improved mortality and morbidity experience. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $494 million, or 20%, to $2,935 million in 2000 from $2,441 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $95 million, or 4%. This is primarily attributable to increases of $54 million, or 5%, in Institutional and $36 million, or 3%, in Individual. The higher expense in Institutional is largely due to an increase in group insurance of $84 million, which resulted from asset growth in customer account balances, growth in the bank owned life insurance business and increases in the cash values of executive and corporate owned universal life plans. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in retirement and savings products of $30 million, due to a continued shift in customers investment preferences from guaranteed interest products to separate account alternatives. The increase in Individual is predominately due to higher policyholder account balances and increases in crediting rates on annuity and investment products. Policyholder dividends increased by $229 million, or 14%, to $1,919 million in 2000 from $1,690 million in 1999. Excluding the acquisition of GenAmerica, policyholder dividends increased by $20 million, or 1%. Policyholder dividends vary from period to period based on participating group and traditional individual life insurance contract experience. Payments of $327 million were made during the second quarter of 2000, as part of Metropolitan Lifes demutualization, to holders of certain policies transferred to Clarica Life Insurance Company in connection with the sale of a substantial portion of the Canadian operations in 1998. Demutualization costs decreased by $30 million, or 12%, to $230 million in 2000 from $260 million in 1999. These costs are related to Metropolitan Lifes demutualization on April 7, 2000. Other expenses increased by $1,562 million, or 24%, to $8,024 million in 2000 from $6,462 million in 1999. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which are discussed below, other expenses increased by $1,717 million, or 26%, to $8,409 million in 2000 from $6,692 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, other expenses increased by $405 million, or 6%. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in Auto & Home, Individual, Institutional and International. These increases are partially offset by a $354 million, or 45%, decrease in Corporate & Other and a $101 million, or 13%, decrease in Asset Management. The increase in Auto & Home of $311 million, or 59%, is largely due to the St. Paul acquisition. The increase in Individual of $298 million, or 11%, is partially attributable to a $111 million increase from the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries commensurate with the increase in other revenues and increased securities lending volume. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. The increase in Institutional of $141 million, or 9%, is primarily due to costs incurred in connection with initiatives focused on improving service delivery capabilities through investments in technology and an increase in volume related expenses associated with premium growth. Volume related expenses include 53 premium taxes, separate account investment management expenses and commissions. The increase in International of $45 million, or 14%, is primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with business expansion efforts in several countries. The decrease in Corporate & Other is primarily due to a $499 million charge in 1999 principally related to the settlement of a multidistrict litigation proceeding involving alleged improper sales practices, accruals for sales practices claims not covered by the settlement and other legal costs. The most significant factor contributing to the decline in Asset Management is the sale of Nvest, which occurred on October 30, 2000. Deferred policy acquisition costs are principally amortized in proportion to gross margins or profits, including investment gains or losses. The amortization is allocated to investment gains and losses to provide consolidated statement of income information regarding the impact of investment gains and losses on the amount of the amortization, and other expenses to provide amounts related to gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to $1,863 million in 2000 from $1,160 million in 1999 while total amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, charged to operations, increased to $1,383 million in 2000 from $884 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to $1,413 million in 2000 from $1,160 in 1999 while total amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to $1,012 million in 2000 from $884 million in 1999. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $1,478 million and $930 million are allocated to other expenses in 2000 and 1999, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment losses. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $1,136 million and $930 million are allocated to other expenses in 2000 and 1999, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment losses. The increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs allocated to other expenses was predominately attributable to Auto & Homes acquisition of St. Paul. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $463 million, or 33% of income before provision for income taxes, compared with $558 million, or 47%, in 1999. The 2000 effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35% due to non deductible payments made in the second quarter of 2000 to former Canadian policyholders in connection with the demutualization, a surplus tax benefit of $145 million and a reduction in prior year taxes on capital gains associated with the sale of businesses recorded in the third quarter of 2000. The 1999 effective rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of surplus tax. Prior to its demutualization, Metropolitan Life was subject to surplus tax imposed on mutual life insurance companies under Section 809 of the Internal Revenue Code. The surplus tax results from the disallowance of a portion of a mutual life insurance companys policyholder dividends as a deduction from taxable income. 54 INDIVIDUAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Individual segment for the years indicated: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $ 4,563 $ 4,673 $ 4,289 Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 1,260 1,221 888 Net investment income................................... 6,512 6,475 5,346 Other revenues.......................................... 495 650 381 Net investment gains (losses)........................... 827 227 (14) Total revenues..................................... 13,657 13,246 10,890 EXPENSES Policyholder benefits and claims........................ 5,233 5,054 4,625 Interest credited to policyholder account balances...... 1,898 1,680 1,359 Policyholder dividends.................................. 1,767 1,742 1,509 Other expenses.......................................... 3,012 3,323 2,542 Total expenses..................................... 11,910 11,799 10,035 Income before provision for income taxes................ 1,747 1,447 855 Provision for income taxes.............................. 652 527 300 Net income.............................................. $ 1,095 $ 920 $ 555 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 INDIVIDUAL Premiums decreased by $110 million, or 2%, to $4,563 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $4,673 million for the comparable 2000 period. Premiums from insurance products declined by $108 million. This decrease is primarily due to declines in traditional life insurance policies, which reflects a maturing of that business and a continued shift in customer preference from those policies to variable life products. Premiums from annuity and investment type products declined by $2 million, due to lower sales of supplementary contracts with life contingencies and single premium immediate annuity business. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $39 million, or 3%, to $1,260 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,221 million for the comparable 2000 period. Policy fees from insurance products rose by $149 million. This growth is primarily due to increases in variable life products reflecting a continued shift in customer preferences from traditional life products. Policy fees from annuity and investment type products decreased by $110 million, primarily resulting from a lower average separate account asset base. Policy fees from annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of average assets. Such assets can fluctuate depending on equity market performance. Thus, the amount of fees can increase or decrease consistent with movements in average separate account balances. Other revenues decreased by $155 million, or 24%, to $495 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $650 million for the comparable 2000 period, primarily due to reduced commission and fee income associated with lower sales in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries, which was a result of the equity market downturn. Such commission and fee income can fluctuate consistent with movements in the equity market. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $179 million, or 4%, to $5,233 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $5,054 million for the comparable 2000 period. Policyholder benefits and claims for insurance products rose by $192 million primarily due to increases in the liabilities for future policy benefits commensurate with the aging of the in force block of business. In addition, increases of $74 million and 55 $24 million in the policyholder dividend obligation and liabilities and claims associated with the September 11, 2001 tragedies, respectively, contributed to the variance. Partially offsetting these variances is a reduction in policyholder benefits and claims for annuity and investment products due to a decrease in liabilities for supplemental contracts with life contingencies. Interest credited to policyholder account balances rose by $218 million, or 13%, to $1,898 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,680 million for the comparable 2000 period. Interest on insurance products increased by $165 million, primarily due to the establishment of a policyholder liability of $118 million with respect to certain group annuity contracts at New England Financial. The remainder of the variance is predominately a result of higher average policyholder account balances. Interest on annuity and investment products grew by $53 million due to slightly higher crediting rates and higher policyholder account balances stemming from increased sales, including products with a dollar cost averaging type feature. Policyholder dividends increased by $25 million, or 1%, to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,742 million for the comparable 2000 period. This is largely attributable to the growth in the assets supporting policies associated with this segments aging block of traditional life insurance business. Other expenses decreased by $311 million, or 9%, to $3,012 for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $3,323 million for the comparable 2000 period. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs that are discussed below, other expenses are lower by $167 million, or 5%, to $3,305 million in 2001 from $3,472 million in 2000. Other expenses related to insurance products decreased by $204 million due to continued expense management, primarily due to reduced employee costs and lower discretionary spending. In addition, there were reductions in volume related commission expenses in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries and rebate expenses associated with the Companys securities lending program. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. These decreases are partially offset by an increase of $62 million related to fourth quarter 2001 business realignment initiatives. The annuity and investment type products experienced an increase in other expenses of $37 million primarily due to expenses associated with the business realignment initiatives. Deferred policy acquisition costs are principally amortized in proportion to gross margins or gross profits, including investment gains or losses. The amortization is allocated to investment gains and losses to provide consolidated statement of income information regarding the impact of investment gains and losses on the amount of the amortization, and to other expenses to provide amounts related to gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $54 million, or 6%, to $926 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $872 million for the comparable 2000 period. This increase is primarily due to higher sales of variable and universal life insurance policies and annuity and investment type products, resulting in higher commissions and other deferrable expenses. Total amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $26 million, or 4%, to $654 million in 2001 from $628 million in 2000. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $633 million and $723 million is allocated to other expenses in 2001 and 2000, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment gains and losses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs allocated to other expenses related to insurance products declined by $48 million due to refinements in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs allocated to other expenses related to annuity and investment products declined by $42 million due to refinements in the calculation of estimated gross profits. Contributing to this variance are modifications made in the third quarter of 2001 relating to the manner in which estimates of future market performance are developed. These estimates are used in determining unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs balances and the amount of related amortization. The modification reflects an expected impact of past market performance on future market performance, and improves the ability to estimate deferred policy acquisition costs balances and related amortization. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 INDIVIDUAL Premiums increased by $384 million, or 9%, to $4,673 million in 2000 from $4,289 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, premiums decreased by $72 million, or 2%. Premiums from insurance products decreased by $82 million, or 2%, to $4,133 million in 2000 from $4,215 million in 1999. 56 This decrease is primarily due to a decline in sales of traditional life insurance policies, which reflects a continued shift in policyholders preferences from those policies to variable life products. Premiums from annuity and investment products increased by $10 million, or 14%, to $84 million in 2000 from $74 million in 1999. This increase is largely attributable to increased sales of supplementary contracts with life contingencies and immediate annuity products. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $333 million, or 38%, to $1,221 million in 2000 from $888 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, universal life and investment type fees increased by $130 million, or 15%. Policy fees from insurance products increased by $48 million, or 8%, to $619 million in 2000 from $571 million in 1999, primarily due to increased sales of variable life products and continued growth in separate accounts, reflecting a continued shift in customer preferences from traditional life products. This increase also reflects the acceleration of the recognition of unearned fees in connection with a product replacement program related to universal life policies. Policy fees from annuity and investment products increased by $82 million, or 26%, to $399 million in 2000 from $317 million in 1999, primarily due to continued growth in separate account assets. Other revenues increased by $269 million, or 71%, to $650 million in 2000 from $381 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, other revenues increased by $96 million, or 25%. Other revenues for insurance products increased by $98 million, or 28%, to $445 million in 2000 from $347 million in 1999. This increase is principally attributable to higher commission and fee income associated with increased sales in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries. Other revenues for annuity products remained essentially unchanged at $32 million in 2000 compared with $34 million in 1999. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $429 million, or 9%, to $5,054 million in 2000 from $4,625 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $103 million, or 2%. Policyholder benefits and claims for insurance products decreased by $111 million, or 2%, to $4,339 million in 2000 from $4,450 million in 1999. This decrease is predominately a result of improved mortality and morbidity experience. Policyholder benefits and claims for annuity and investment products increased by $8 million, or 5%, to $183 million in 2000 from $175 million in 1999, commensurate with the increase in premiums discussed above. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $321 million, or 24%, to $1,680 million in 2000 from $1,359 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $36 million, or 3%. Interest on insurance products increased by $26 million, or 6%, to $445 million in 2000 from $419 million in 1999, largely due to higher policyholder account balances. Higher crediting rates caused interest on annuity and investment products to increase by $10 million, or 1%, to $950 million in 2000 from $940 million in 1999. Policyholder dividends increased by $233 million, or 15%, to $1,742 million in 2000 from $1,509 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, policyholder dividends increased by $33 million, or 2%. This increase is due to growth in cash values of policies associated with this segments large block of traditional life insurance business. Other expenses increased by $781 million, or 31%, to $3,323 million in 2000 from $2,542 million in 1999. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which are discussed below, other expenses increased by $773 million, or 29%, to $3,472 million in 2000 from $2,699 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, other expenses increased by $298 million, or 11%. Other expenses related to insurance products increased by $189 million, or 9%, to $2,252 million in 2000 from $2,063 million in 1999. This increase is attributable to a $111 million increase from the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries commensurate with the increase in other revenues discussed above. In addition, increased volume in the securities lending program resulted in a $122 million increase in related rebate expense. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $44 million reduction in general and administrative expenses. Other expenses related to annuity and investment products increased by $109 million, or 17%, to $745 million in 2000 from $636 million in 1999. This increase resulted from a $54 million increase in rebate expense associated with the Companys securities lending program. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. The remaining increase is largely attributable to a $55 million increase in general and administrative expenses 57 incurred in connection with initiatives focused on improving service delivery capabilities through investments in technology and the consolidation of operations. Deferred policy acquisition costs are principally amortized in proportion to gross margins or gross profits, including investment gains or losses. The amortization is allocated to investment gains and losses to provide consolidated statement of income information regarding the impact of investment gains and losses on the amount of the amortization, and other expenses to provide amounts related to gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $90 million to $872 million in 2000 from $782 million in 1999, while total amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, charged to operations, increased by $49 million to $628 million in 2000 from $579 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by $6 million, or 1%, while total amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by $117 million, or 20%. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $723 million and $625 million are allocated to other expenses in 2000 and 1999, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment gains and losses. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $585 million and $625 million are allocated to other expenses in 2000 and 1999, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment gains and losses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs allocated to other expenses related to insurance products decreased by $128 million to $389 million in 2000 from $517 in 1999. This decrease is due to refinements in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits, as well as the acceleration of the recognition of unearned fees in connection with the product replacement program discussed above. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs allocated to other expenses related to annuity and investment products increased by $88 million to $196 million in 2000 from $108 million in 1999. This increase is primarily due to refinements in the calculation of estimated gross profits. INSTITUTIONAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Institutional segment for the years indicated: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $ 7,288 $ 6,900 $ 5,525 Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 592 547 502 Net investment income................................... 4,161 3,959 3,755 Other revenues.......................................... 649 650 609 Net investment losses...................................

Group insurance premiums grew by $680 million, due, in most part, to sales growth and continued favorable policyholder retention in this segments dental, disability and long term care businesses. In addition, premiums received from several existing group life customers in 2001 and the BMA acquisition contributed $173 million and $29 million, respectively, to this variance. The 2000 balance includes $124 million in additional insurance coverages purchased by existing customers with funds received in the demutualization. Retirement and savings premiums decreased by $292 million, primarily as a result of $270 million in premiums received in 2000 from existing customers. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $45 million, or 8%, to $592 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $547 million for the comparable 2000 period. The rise in fees reflects growth in sales and deposits in group universal life and corporate owned life insurance products. Higher fees in group universal life products represent an increase in insured lives for an existing customer, coupled with a change in a customer preference for group life over optional term products. The increase in corporate owned life insurance represents a $27 million fee received in 2001 from an existing customer. Other revenues decreased by $1 million to $649 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $650 million for the comparable 2000 period. Group insurance other revenues decreased by $19 million. This decline is primarily attributable to the renegotiation of an existing contract with a significant long term care customer, as well as $20 million in final settlements in 2000 on several cases relating to the term life and former medical business. This variance is partially offset by a rise in other revenues stemming from sales growth in this segments dental and disability administrative businesses. Retirement and savings other revenues increased by $18 million, due to $12 million in earnings on seed money and an increase in administrative services fees for the defined contribution group businesses. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $746 million, or 9%, to $8,924 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $8,178 million for the comparable 2000 period. Group insurance policyholder benefits and claims grew by $778 million, primarily due to growth in this segments group life, dental, disability and long term care insurance businesses, commensurate with the premium variance discussed above. In addition, $291 million in claims related to the September 11, 2001 tragedies contributed to this variance. Retirement and savings policyholder benefits and claims declined by $32 million. A decrease commensurate with the $292 million premium variance discussed above is almost entirely offset by a $215 million increase in policyholder benefits associated with fourth quarter business realignment initiatives. Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by $77 million, or 7%, to $1,013 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,090 million for the comparable 2000 period. A $24 million drop in group life is largely attributable to an overall decline in crediting rates in 2001 as a result of the current interest rate environment. The variance in group life was partially dampened by an increase in average customer account balances stemming from asset growth, resulting in $12 million in additional interest credited. Retirement and savings decreased by $53 million, or 9%, to $549 million in 2001 from $602 million in 2000, due to a overall decline in crediting rates in 2001 as a result of the current interest rate environment. Policyholder dividends increased by $135 million, or 109%, to $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $124 million for the comparable 2000 period. The rise in dividends is primarily attributed to favorable experience on a large group life contract in 2001. Policyholder dividends vary from period to period based on insurance contract experience. Other expenses increased by $177 million, or 10%, to $1,907 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,730 million for the comparable 2000 period. Group insurance expenses grew by $94 million due primarily to a rise in non deferrable variable expenses associated with premium growth. Non deferrable variable expenses include premium tax, commissions and administrative expenses for dental, disability and long term care businesses. This variance is partially offset by a decline in rebate expenses associated with the Companys securities lending program. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. Other expenses related to retirement and savings rose by $83 million and is largely attributable to 59 $184 million in expenses associated with fourth quarter business realignment initiatives. This variance is partially offset by a decrease in expenses, due in most part, to expense management initiatives and lower rebate expenses associated with the Companys securities lending program. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 INSTITUTIONAL Premiums increased by $1,375 million, or 25%, to $6,900 million in 2000 from $5,525 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, premiums increased by $1,297 million, or 23%, to $6,822 million in 2000 from $5,525 million in 1999. Group insurance premiums increased by $953 million, or 19%, to $6,048 million in 2000 from $5,095 million in 1999. This increase is predominately the result of strong sales and continued favorable policyholder retention in this segments group life, dental and disability businesses, as well as $124 million of additional insurance coverages purchased by existing customers with funds received in the demutualization. In addition, the BMA and Lincoln National acquisitions contributed $103 million to the variance. Retirement and savings premiums increased by $344 million, or 80%, to $774 million in 2000 from $430 million in 1999, primarily due to significant premiums received from existing customers in 2000. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $45 million, or 9%, to $547 million in 2000 from $502 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $6 million, or 1%, to $508 million in 2000 from $502 million in 1999. This increase reflects growth in group universal life products. Other revenues increased by $41 million, or 7%, to $650 million in 2000 from $609 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, other revenues increased by $33 million, or 5%, to $642 million in 2000 from $609 million in 1999. Group insurance other revenues increased by $53 million, or 18%, to $355 million in 2000 from $302 million in 1999. The primary driver of this increase was strong sales growth in this segments dental and disability administrative services businesses. Retirement and savings other revenues decreased by $20 million, or 7%, to $287 million in 2000 from $307 million in 1999, primarily due to a special performance fee received in 1999. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $1,466 million, or 22%, to $8,178 million in 2000 from $6,712 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, policyholder benefits and claims increased by $1,366 million, or 20%, to $8,078 million in 2000 from $6,712 million in 1999. Group life increased by $411 million, or 12%, to $3,941 million in 2000 from $3,530 million in 1999, primarily due to overall growth in the business, commensurate with the premium variance discussed above. Non medical health increased by $614 million, or 46%, to $1,941 million in 2000 from $1,327 million in 1999. This increase is largely attributable to significant growth in this segments dental and disability businesses. In addition, the BMA and Lincoln National acquisitions contributed to the variance. Retirement and savings increased by $341 million, or 18%, to $2,196 million in 2000 from $1,855 million in 1999 commensurate with the premium variance above. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $60 million, or 6%, to $1,090 million in 2000 from $1,030 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $54 million, or 5%, to $1,084 million in 2000 from $1,030 million in 1999. Group insurance increased by $84 million, or 21%, to $482 million in 2000 from $398 million in 1999. This increase is primarily due to asset growth in customer account balances and the bank owned life insurance business, as well as an increase in the cash values of executive and corporate owned universal life plans. Retirement and savings decreased by $30 million, or 5%, to $602 million in 2000 from $632 million in 1999, due to a continued shift in customers investment preferences from guaranteed interest products to separate account alternatives. Policyholder dividends decreased by $35 million, or 22%, to $124 million in 2000 from $159 million in 1999. Policyholder dividends vary from period to period based on participating group insurance contract experience. Other expenses increased by $161 million, or 10%, to $1,730 million in 2000 from $1,569 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, expenses increased by $123 million, or 8%, to $1,692 million in 2000 from $1,569 million in 1999. Other expenses related to group life increased by 60 $56 million, or 15%, to $438 million in 2000 from $382 million in 1999. Other expenses related to group non medical health increased by $12 million, or 2%, to $685 million in 2000 from $673 million in 1999. Other expenses related to retirement and savings increased by $55 million, or 11%, to $569 million in 2000 from $514 million in 1999. These increases are primarily due to costs incurred in connection with initiatives that focused on improving service delivery capabilities through investments in technology and higher expenses associated with the Companys securities lending program. The income associated with securities lending activity is included in net investment income. In addition, an increase in volume related expenses associated with premium growth contributed to the variance. Volume related expenses include premium taxes, separate account investment management expenses and commissions. REINSURANCE The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Reinsurance segment for the years indicated: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................... $1,762 $1,450 Net investment income....................................... 390 379 Other revenues.............................................. 42 29 Net investment losses.......................................

The Companys Reinsurance segment is comprised of the life reinsurance business of RGA, and MetLifes ancillary life reinsurance business. The ancillary life reinsurance business was an immaterial component of MetLifes Individual segment for years prior to January 1, 2000. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REINSURANCE Premiums increased by $312 million, or 22%, to $1,762 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,450 million for the comparable 2000 period. New premiums from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business all contributed to the premium growth. Premium levels are significantly influenced by large transactions and reporting practices of ceding companies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Other revenues increased by $13 million, or 45%, to $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $29 million for the comparable 2000 period. The increase is due to an increase in fees earned on financial 61 reinsurance, primarily as a result of the acquisition of RGA Financial Group, LLC during the second half of 2000. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $388 million, or 35%, to $1,484 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $1,096 million for the comparable 2000 period. Claims experience for the year ended December 31, 2001, includes claims arising from the September 11, 2001 tragedies of approximately $16 million, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers. As a percentage of premiums, policyholder benefits and claims increased to 84% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 76% for the comparable 2000 period. This increase is attributed primarily to higher than expected mortality in the U.S. reinsurance operations during the first and fourth quarters, in addition to the claims arising from the terrorist attacks. Additionally, increases for benefits and adverse results on the reinsurance of Argentine pension business contributed to the increase. Mortality is expected to vary from period to period, but generally remains fairly constant over the long term. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $13 million, or 12%, to $122 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $109 million for the comparable 2000 period. Interest credited to policyholder account balances relates to amounts credited on deposit type contracts and certain cash value contracts. The increase is primarily related to an increase in the underlying account balances due to a new block of single premium deferred annuities reinsured in 2001. Additionally, the crediting rate on certain blocks of annuities is based on the performance of the underlying assets. Therefore, any fluctuations in interest credited related to these blocks are generally offset by a corresponding change in net investment income. Policyholder dividends were essentially unchanged at $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Other expenses decreased by $7 million, or 2%, to $439 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $446 million for the comparable 2000 period. Other expenses, which include underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, were 20% of segment revenues in 2001 compared with 24% in 2000. This percentage fluctuates depending on the mix of the underlying insurance products being reinsured. Minority interest, which represents third party ownership interests in RGA, decreased by $15 million, or 22%, to $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $67 million for the comparable 2000 period due to lower RGA pre minority interest net income. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REINSURANCE Revenues were $1,856 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Reinsurance revenues are primarily derived from renewal premiums from existing reinsurance treaties, new business premiums from existing or new reinsurance treaties and income earned on invested assets. Premium levels are significantly influenced by large transactions and reporting practices of ceding companies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Expenses were $1,672 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Policy benefits and claims were 76% of premiums for the year ended December 31, 2000, which is consistent with managements expectations. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, which are included in other expenses, were 24% of premiums for the year ended December 31, 2000. This percentage fluctuates depending on the mix of the underlying insurance products being reinsured. Interest credited to policyholder account balances are related to amounts credited on RGAs deposit type contracts and cash value products, which have a significant mortality component. This amount fluctuates with the changes in cash values and changes in interest crediting rates. Minority interest, which represents third party ownership interests in RGA, was $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. 62 AUTO & HOME The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Auto & Home segment for the years presented: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................... $2,755 $2,636 $1,751 Net investment income...................................... 200 194 103 Other revenues............................................. 22 40 21 Net investment (losses) gains..............................

(2) (12) 5 Net income................................................. $ 41 $ 30 $ 56 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AUTO & HOME Premiums increased by $119 million, or 5%, to $2,755 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2,636 million for the comparable 2000 period. Auto premiums increased by $99 million. Property premiums increased by $17 million. Both increases were largely due to rate increases. Due to increased rate activity, the retention ratio for the existing business declined from 90% to 89%. Premiums from other personal lines increased by $3 million. Other revenues decreased by $18 million, or 45%, to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $40 million for the comparable 2000 period. This decrease is primarily due to a revision of an estimate made in 2000 of amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to the disposition of this segments reinsurance business in 1990. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $116 million, or 6%, to $2,121 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2,005 million for the comparable 2000 period. Auto policyholder benefits and claims increased by $62 million due to increased average claim costs, growth in the business and adverse weather in the first quarter of 2001. Despite this increase, the auto loss ratio decreased to 75.9% in 2001 from 76.6% in 2000 as a result of higher premiums per policy. Property policyholder benefits and claims increased by $41 million due to increased non catastrophe weather related losses in 2001. Correspondingly, the property loss ratio increased to 80.7% in 2001 from 76.4% in 2000. Catastrophes represented 13.5% of the loss ratio in 2001 compared to 17.3% in 2000. Other policyholder benefits and claims grew by $13 million, primarily due to an increase in high liability personal umbrella claims. This segment tends to be very volatile in the shorter term versus a longer term business cycle due to low premium volume and high liability limits. Other expenses decreased by $27 million, or 3%, to $800 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $827 million for the comparable 2000 period. This decrease is due to a reduction in integration costs associated with the St. Paul acquisition. The expense ratio decreased to 29.0% in 2001 from 31.4% in 2000. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 differ from the corporate tax rate of 35% due to the impact of non taxable investment income. 63 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AUTO & HOME Premiums increased by $885 million, or 51%, to $2,636 million in 2000 from $1,751 million in 1999, primarily due to the St. Paul acquisition in 1999. Excluding the impact of the St. Paul acquisition, premiums increased by $130 million, or 9%. Auto premiums increased by $95 million, or 8%, to $1,313 million in 2000 from $1,218 million in 1999. This increase is primarily due to growth in the standard auto insurance book of business, which was attributable to increased new business production resulting from an increase in independent agents in this segments sales force and improved retention in the existing business. Policyholder retention in the standard auto business increased by 1% to 89%. Homeowner premiums increased by $27 million, or 11%, to $282 million in 2000 from $255 million in 1999 due to higher new business production as a result of a larger sales force and an increase in policyholder retention of 2% to 91% in 2000 from 89% in 1999. Premiums from other personal lines increased by 44% to $26 million in 2000 from $18 million in 1999. Other revenues increased by $19 million, or 90%, to $40 million in 2000 from $21 million in 1999, primarily due to a revision of an estimate of amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to the disposition of this segments reinsurance business in 1990. Expenses increased by $1,017 million, or 56%, to $2,832 million in 2000 from $1,815 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the St. Paul acquisition, expenses increased by $152 million, or 10%, which resulted in an increase in the combined ratio to 103.9% in 2000 from 102.8% in 1999. As discussed below, higher overall loss costs, predominately in the homeowners line, is the primary cause of this increase. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $704 million, or 54%, to $2,005 million in 2000 from $1,301 million in 1999. Automobile policyholder benefits and claims increased by $438 million, or 42%, to $1,490 million in 2000 from $1,052 million in 1999. Homeowner policyholder benefits and claims increased by $260 million, or 112%, to $493 million in 2000 from $233 million in 1999. Other policyholder benefits and claims increased by $6 million, or 38%, to $22 million in 2000 from $16 million in 1999. Correspondingly, the auto loss ratio increased to 76.6% in 2000 from 76.1% in 1999 and the homeowners loss ratio increased to 76.4% from 67.2% in 1999. The increase in the homeowners loss ratio is primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and expenses, predominantly in the St. Paul book of business. Catastrophes, including multiple storms and the Los Alamos fire, resulted in an increase in the catastrophe loss ratio to 17.3% in 2000 from 6.3% in 1999. Excluding the impact of the St. Paul acquisition, policyholder benefits and claims increased by $124 million, or 11%. Auto policyholder benefits and claims increased by $102 million, or 11%, to $1,041 million in 2000 from $939 million in 1999. This is largely attributable to a 9% increase in the number of policies in force and increased costs resulting from an increase in the use of original equipment manufacturer parts and higher labor rates. The auto loss ratio increased to 79.3% in 2000 from 77.1% in 1999. Homeowners benefits and claims increased by $23 million, or 14%, to $186 million in 2000 from $163 million in 1999, primarily due to the increased volume of this book of business and increased catastrophe experience as discussed above. The homeowners loss ratio increased by 1.6% to 66.0% in 2000 from 64.4% in 1999. Other personal lines benefits and claims decreased by $1 million to $11 million in 2000 from $12 million in 1999. Other expenses increased by $313 million, or 61%, to $827 million in 2000 from $514 million in 1999, which resulted in an increase in the expense ratio to 31.4% in 2000 from 29.3% in 1999. A portion of the increase in expenses from 1999 to 2000 is associated with the costs incurred in connection with the integration of the St. Paul business acquired. 64 ASSET MANAGEMENT The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset Management segment for the years presented: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Net investment income....................................... $ 71 $ 90 $ 80 Other revenues.............................................. 198 760 803 Net investment gains........................................ 25 Total revenues......................................... 294 850 883 OTHER EXPENSES.............................................. 252 749 741 Income before provision for income taxes and minority interest.................................................. 42 101 142 Provision for income taxes.................................. 15 32 37 Minority interest........................................... 35 54 Net income.................................................. $ 27 $ 34 $ 51 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 ASSET MANAGEMENT Other revenues, which are primarily comprised of management and advisory fees from third parties, decreased by $562 million, or 74%, to $198 million in 2001 from $760 million in 2000. The most significant factors contributing to this decline were a $522 million decrease resulting from the sale of Nvest, which occurred on October 30, 2000, and a $48 million decrease resulting from the sale of Conning, which occurred on July 2, 2001. Excluding the impact of these transactions, other revenues increased by $8 million, or 5%, to $167 million in 2001 from $159 million in 2000. This is attributable to an increase in real estate assets under management that command a higher fee. Assets under management in the remaining Asset Management organization decreased from $56 billion as of December 31, 2000 to $51 billion at December 31, 2001. The decline occurred as a result of the equity market downturn and MetLife institutional customer withdrawals. Third party assets under management registered only a slight decrease of $352 million as a result of the equity market downturn, substantially offset by strong mutual fund sales and the purchase of a real estate portfolio in the second quarter of 2001 comprised of new assets of $1.7 billion. Management and advisory fees are typically calculated based on a percentage of assets under management, and are not necessarily proportionate to average assets managed due to changes in account mix. Other expenses decreased by $497 million, or 66%, to $252 million in 2001 from $749 million in 2000. The sale of Nvest reduced other expenses by $457 million and the sale of Conning reduced other expenses by $55 million. Excluding the impact of these transactions, other expenses increased by $15 million, or 7%, to $217 million in 2001 from $202 million in 2000. This variance is attributable to an increase in total compensation and benefits and an increase in discretionary spending. Compensation and benefits expense totaled $111 million in 2001 and is comprised of approximately 63% base compensation and 37% variable compensation. Base compensation increased by $9 million, or 15%, to $70 million in 2001 from $61 million in 2000, primarily due to higher staffing levels. Variable compensation decreased by $1 million, or 2%, to $41 million in 2001 from $42 million in 2000 due to lower profitability. Variable incentive payments are based upon profitability, investment portfolio performance, new business sales and growth in revenues and profits. The variable compensation plans reward the employees for growth in their businesses, but also require them to share in the impact of any declines. Increased sales commissions arising from higher mutual fund sales in 2001 were largely offset by downward revisions in other variable compensation due to a decline in profits. Other general and administrative expenses increased $7 million, or 7%, to $106 million in 2001 from $99 million in 2000, primarily due to increases in occupancy costs and increased mutual fund reimbursement subsidies. 65 Minority interest, principally reflecting third party ownership interest in Nvest, decreased by $35 million, or 100%, due to the sale of Nvest. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 ASSET MANAGEMENT Other revenues, which are primarily comprised of management and advisory fees, decreased by $43 million, or 5%, to $760 million in 2000 from $803 million in 1999. The most significant factor contributing to this decline is a $131 million decrease resulting primarily from the sale of Nvest, which occurred on October 30, 2000. This reduction is partially offset by a $79 million increase related to the acquisition of Conning, a component of the GenAmerica acquisition. Excluding the impact of these transactions, other revenues increased by $9 million, or 6%, to $159 million in 2000 from $150 million in 1999. This is attributable to an increase in average assets under management during the year and a change in asset mix. Despite a $1 billion, or 2%, decrease in assets under management from $57 billion as of December 31, 1999 to $56 billion at December 31, 2000, average assets under management exceed those for the same period in 1999. The decline occurred during the fourth quarter as a result of a market downturn. Management and advisory fees are typically calculated based on a percentage of assets under management, and are not necessarily proportionate to average assets managed due to changes in account mix. Other expenses increased by $8 million, or 1%, to $749 million in 2000 from $741 million in 1999. The sale of Nvest reduced other expenses by $92 million and the acquisition of Conning increased other expenses by $90 million. Excluding the impact of these transactions, other expenses increased by $10 million, or 5%, to $202 million in 2000 from $192 million in 1999. Approximately half of the variance is attributable to an increase in total compensation and benefits. This expense totaled $103 million for the year 2000 and is comprised of approximately 59% base compensation and 41% variable compensation. Base compensation increased by $2 million, or 3%, to $61 million in 2000 from $59 million in 1999, primarily due to annual salary increases and higher staffing levels. Variable compensation increased by $3 million, or 8%, to $42 million in 2000 from $39 million in 1999. Variable incentive payments are based upon profitability, investment portfolio performance, new business sales and growth in revenues and profits. The variable compensation plans reward the employees for growth in their businesses, but also require them to share in the impact of any declines. General administrative expenses increased by $5 million, or 5%, to $99 million in 2000 from $94 million in 1999. This increase is primarily due to increased mutual fund expense subsidies, distribution costs and system enhancements. Minority interest, reflecting third party ownership interest in Nvest, decreased by $19 million, or 35%, to $35 million in 2000 from $54 million in 1999. 66 INTERNATIONAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the International segment for the years indicated: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................... $ 846 $ 660 $523 Universal life and investment type product policy fees...... 38 53 43 Net investment income....................................... 267 254 206 Other revenues.............................................. 16 9 12 Net investment (losses) gains...............................

Mexicos premiums grew by $89 million due to additional sales in group life, major medical and individual life products. Protection type product sales fostered by the continued expansion of the professional sales force in South Korea accounted for an additional $41 million in premiums. Spains premiums rose by $18 million primarily due to continued growth in the direct auto business. Higher individual life sales resulted in an additional $17 million in Taiwanese premiums. The 2001 acquisition of Seasul in Brazil and the Chilean acquisitions increased premiums by $12 million and $7 million, respectively, in those countries. Hong Kongs premiums grew by $5 million primarily due to continued growth in the direct marketing, group life, and traditional life businesses. These variances were partially offset by a $3 million decline in Argentinean individual life premiums, reflecting the impact of recent economic and political events in that country. If these conditions continue, management expects further declines in Argentinean premiums. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Universal life and investment type product policy fees decreased by $15 million, or 28%, to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $53 million for the comparable 2000 period. This decline is primarily attributable to a $19 million reduction in fees in Spain caused by a reduction in assets under management, as a result of a planned cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Other revenues increased by $7 million, or 78%, to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $9 million for the comparable 2000 period. Argentinas other revenues grew by $5 million primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in the private pension business, which was introduced in the third quarter of 67 2001. The required accounting for foreign currency translation fluctuations in Indonesia, a highly inflationary economy, resulted in a $3 million increase in other revenues. These variances were partially offset by a $3 million decrease in Taiwan due to higher group reinsurance commissions received in 2000. The remainder of the increase is attributable to minor variances in several countries. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $127 million, or 23%, to $689 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $562 million for the comparable 2000 period. Mexicos, South Koreas and Taiwans policyholder benefits and claims grew by $74 million, $24 million and $15 million, respectively, commensurate with the overall premium variance discussed above. Brazils policyholder benefits and claims rose by $9 million primarily due to the acquisition of Seasul. In addition, the Chilean acquisitions contributed $7 million to this variance. These variances are partially offset by a $7 million decline in Argentinas policyholder benefits and claims as a result of the impact of recent economic and political events in that country. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by $5 million, or 9%, to $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $56 million for the comparable 2000 period. An overall decline in crediting rates on interest sensitive products in 2001 as a result of the current interest rate environment is primarily responsible for a $6 million reduction in South Korea. Spains interest credited dropped by $6 million due to a reduction in assets under management, as a result of a planned cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander. These variances were partially offset by a $2 million increase in both Mexico and Argentina, due to an increase in average customer account balances. Although Argentinean average customer account balances increased in 2001, management expects there will be a future reduction in assets under management as a result of the recent economic and political events in that country. However, government imposed withdrawal restrictions as well as contract terms, specifically surrender charges, may moderate the impact. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Policyholder dividends increased by $4 million, or 13%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $32 million for the comparable 2000 period. The growth in Mexicos group life sales mentioned above resulted in an increase in policyholder dividends of $2 million. Taiwans individual life sales contributed an additional $2 million in policyholder dividends. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Payments of $327 million related to Metropolitan Lifes demutualization were made during the second quarter of 2000 to holders of certain policies transferred to Clarica Life Insurance Company in connection with the sale of a substantial portion of the Companys Canadian operations in 1998. Other expenses increased by $37 million, or 13%, to $329 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $292 million in the comparable 2000 period. Argentinas other expenses rose by $15 million due to a write off of deferred policy acquisition costs, resulting from a revision in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits caused by the anticipated impact of recent economic and political events in that country. Mexico and South Koreas other expenses grew by $13 million and $10 million, respectively, primarily due to the growth in business in these countries. Brazils other expenses rose by $7 million primarily due to the acquisition of Seasul. In addition, the Chilean acquisitions contributed $3 million to this variance. These variances were partially offset by an $11 million decrease in Spains other expenses due to a reduction in payroll, commissions, and administrative expenses as a result of a planned cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 INTERNATIONAL Premiums increased by $137 million, or 26%, to $660 million in 2000 from $523 million in 1999. Mexicos premiums increased by $45 million, primarily due to new business growth in the group life and major medical products. South Koreas increase in premiums of $29 million is mainly attributable to the establishment of a new professional agency force resulting in higher productivity levels and an improvement in the individual life business persistency. The majority of Taiwans premium increase of $28 million is due to overall growth in the individual life business. Increased sales from the direct auto business is the principal driver behind Spains premium increase of $18 million. Brazils premiums increased by $14 million resulting predominately from 68 business expansion. Brazil began selling business late in the second quarter of 1999 and acquired two large blocks of business in the beginning of 2000. The remainder of the increase is due to minor increases in several other countries. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $10 million, or 23%, to $53 million in 2000 from $43 million in 1999, primarily due to expanded business operations in both Argentina and Spain. Other revenues decreased by $3 million to $9 million in 2000 from $12 million in 1999. This decrease is attributable to variances in several countries. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $104 million, or 23%, to $562 million in 2000 from $458 million in 1999. Mexico, Taiwan, South Korea and Brazils policyholder benefits and claims increased by $35 million, $32 million, $14 million and $8 million, respectively, commensurate with the overall premium growth discussed above. Spains policyholder benefits and claims increased by $11 million, primarily due to increases in auto claims. This is consistent with the premium growth discussed above. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to expanded business operations in several other countries. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $4 million, or 8%, to $56 million in 2000 from $52 million in 1999 as a result of growth in policyholder account balances in Argentina and Mexico. Policyholder dividends increased by $10 million, or 45%, to $32 million in 2000 from $22 million in 1999. This increase is largely attributable to growth in Mexicos participating group business and is in line with the increase in premiums discussed above. Payments of $327 million related to Metropolitan Lifes demutualization were made during the second quarter of 2000 to holders of certain policies transferred to Clarica Life Insurance Company in connection with the sale of a substantial portion of the Companys Canadian operations in 1998. Other expenses increased by $44 million, or 18%, to $292 million in 2000 from $248 million in 1999. This increase is partially attributable to business expansion initiatives in Brazil and Uruguay and the establishment of operations in Poland, the Philippines, and India in 2000. The remaining increase in other expenses is commensurate with the overall growth discussed above. CORPORATE & OTHER YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Total revenues for Corporate & Other, which consist of net investment income, other revenues, and net investment losses that are not allocated to other business segments, decreased by $1,364 million, or 372%, to $(997) million in 2001 from $367 million in 2000. This decrease is primarily due to a $1,263 million increase in net investment losses. This rise in net investment losses reflects the elimination of a $1,526 million inter segment gain associated with the inter company sale of certain real estate properties to Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity Company, a subsidiary of the Holding Company, from Metropolitan Life. Total Corporate & Other expenses decreased by $6 million, or 1%, to $777 million in 2001 from $783 million in 2000. This decline in expenses is attributable to a $230 million reduction in demutualization costs and a $58 million decrease in interest expense due to reduced average levels in borrowing and a lower interest rate environment in 2001. These variances are partially offset by an increase in other expenses associated with a $250 million charge related to race conscious litigation recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $29 million of additional expenses associated with MetLife, Inc. shareholder services costs and start up costs relating to MetLifes banking initiatives. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 Total revenues for Corporate & Other, which consist of net investment income, other revenues, and net investment losses that are not allocated to other business segments, increased by $33 million, or 10%, to $367 million in 2000 from $334 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, total revenues decreased by $100 million, or 30%. This decrease is primarily due to a $163 million increase in net investment losses. These losses reflect the continuation of the Companys strategy to reposition its investment portfolio to provide a higher operating return on its invested assets. Total Corporate & Other expenses decreased 69 by $275 million, or 26%, to $783 million in 2000 from $1,058 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the GenAmerica acquisition, total expenses decreased by $371 million, or 35%. During 1999, the Company reported a $499 million charge principally related to the settlement of a multidistrict litigation proceeding involving alleged improper sales practices, accruals for sales practices claims not covered by the settlement and other legal costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE HOLDING COMPANY The primary uses of liquidity of the Holding Company include: common stock dividends, debt service on outstanding debt, including the interest payments on debentures issued to MetLife Capital Trust I and senior notes, contributions to subsidiaries, payment of general operating expenses and the repurchase of the Companys common stock. The Holding Company irrevocably guarantees, on a senior and unsecured basis, the payment in full of distributions on the capital securities and the stated liquidation amount of the capital securities, in each case to the extent of available trust funds. The primary source of the Holding Companys liquidity is dividends it receives from Metropolitan Life. Other sources of liquidity also include programs for short and long term borrowing, as needed, arranged through the Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc., a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life. In addition, the Holding Company filed a shelf registration statement, effective June 1, 2001, with the SEC which permits the registration and issuance of debt and equity securities as described more fully therein. The Company issued debt in the amount of $1.25 billion in November 2001 under this registration statement. See " The Company Financing" below. Under the New York Insurance Law, Metropolitan Life is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). Metropolitan Life will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Superintendent and the Superintendent does not disapprove the distribution. Under the New York Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders. The New York Insurance Department (the "Department") has established informal guidelines for such determinations. The guidelines, among other things, focus on the insurers overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices. Management of the Company cannot provide assurance that Metropolitan Life will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the Holding Company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the Superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that Metropolitan Life must submit for the Superintendents consideration. MetLifes other insurance subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to their respective parent companies. The dividend limitation is based on statutory financial results. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by the Department, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, required investment reserves, reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes. Based on the historic cash flows and the current financial results of Metropolitan Life, subject to any dividend limitations which may be imposed upon Metropolitan Life or its subsidiaries by regulatory authorities, management believes that cash flows from operating activities, together with the dividends Metropolitan Life is permitted to pay without prior insurance regulatory clearance, will be sufficient to enable the Holding Company to make payments on the debentures issued to MetLife Capital Trust I and the senior notes, make dividend payments on its Common Stock, pay all operating expenses and meet its other obligations. On March 28, 2001, the Holding Companys Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion common stock repurchase program. This program began after the completion of an earlier $1 billion repurchase program that was announced on June 27, 2000. Under these authorizations, the Holding Company may purchase its common 70 stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. Under these programs, as of December 31, 2001, MetLife has repurchased 60,065,224 shares of common stock for $1,723 million. At December 31, 2001, $277 million of the March 28, 2001 authorization remained available for common stock repurchases. On February 19, 2002, the Holding Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase program. This program will begin after the completion of the March 28, 2001 repurchase program. On August 7, 2001, the Company purchased 10 million shares of its common stock as part of the sale of 25 million shares of MetLife common stock by Santusa Holdings, S.L., an affiliate of Banco Santander. The sale by Santusa Holdings, S.L. was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement, effective June 29, 2001. Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and Financial Holding Companies Capital. MetLife, Inc. and its insured depository institution subsidiaries are subject to risk based and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding companies. The federal banking regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. At December 31, 2001 MetLife, Inc. and its insured depository institution subsidiaries were in compliance with the aforementioned guidelines. Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and Financial Holding Companies Change of Control. As a "financial holding company" and "bank holding company" under the federal banking laws, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the changes of control. A change of control is conclusively presumed upon acquisitions of 25% or more of any class of voting securities and rebuttably presumed upon acquisitions of 10% or more of any class voting securities. Further, as a result of MetLife, Inc.s ownership of MetLife Bank, N.A., a national bank, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencys approval would be required in connection with a change of control (generally presumed upon the acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities) of MetLife, Inc. THE COMPANY Liquidity sources. The Companys principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from life insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. The Company seeks to include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products, including general account institutional pension products (generally group annuities, including guaranteed interest contracts and certain deposit fund liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. The Companys principal cash inflows from its investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash inflows are the risk of default by debtors, and interest rate and other market volatilities. The Company closely monitors and manages these risks. Additional sources of liquidity to meet unexpected cash outflows are available from the Companys portfolio of liquid assets. These liquid assets include substantial holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, short term investments, marketable fixed maturity securities and common stocks. The Companys available portfolio of liquid assets was approximately $108 billion and $101 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Sources of liquidity also include facilities for short and long term borrowing as needed, arranged through the Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc., a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life. See " Financing" below. Liquidity uses. The Companys principal cash outflows primarily relate to the liabilities associated with its various life insurance, annuity and group pension products, operating expenses and income taxes, as well as principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations. Liabilities arising from its insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under the above named products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. The Companys management believes that its sources of liquidity are more than adequate to meet its current cash requirements, particularly considering the level of liquid assets referred to in the section above. The nature 71 of the Companys diverse product portfolio and customer base lessen the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity in 2002. The following table summarizes its major contractual obligations, apart from those arising from its ordinary product and investment purchase activities: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER Long term debt............................ $3,628 $207 $439 $ 27 $ 272 $609 $2,074 Operating leases.......................... 607 132 113 92 76 60 134 Company obligated securities.............. 1,356 1,006 350 Partnership investments................... 1,898 1,898 Mortgage commitments...................... 423 423 Total..................................... $7,912 $762 $552 $2,017 $1,354 $669 $2,558 The Companys committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating $2,250 million expire $1,250 million in April of 2002 and $1,000 million in April of 2003 and are principally used as backup for the Companys commercial paper program. Additionally, RGA has credit facilities totaling $180 million, all of which expire in 2005. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $473 million in letters of credit from various banks outstanding, all of which expire within one year. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. Litigation. Various litigation claims and assessments against the Company have arisen in the course of the Companys business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Companys compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. It is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. In some of the matters referred to above, very large and or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial position, based on information currently known by the Companys management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Legal Proceedings." Risk based capital ("RBC"). Section 1322 of the New York Insurance Law requires that New York domestic life insurers report their RBC based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. Section 1322 gives the Superintendent explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain RBC levels. At December 31, 2001, Metropolitan Lifes and each of the other U.S. insurance subsidiaries total adjusted capital was in excess of each of the RBC levels required by each state of domicile. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles (the "Codification"), which is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments and became effective January 1, 2001. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. The Department required adoption of 72 the Codification with certain modifications, for the preparation of statutory financial statements effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of the Codification in accordance with NAIC guidance would have increased Metropolitan Lifes statutory capital and surplus by approximately $1.5 billion. The adoption of the Codification, as modified by the Department, increased Metropolitan Lifes statutory capital and surplus by approximately $84 million, as of January 1, 2001. Further modifications by state insurance departments may impact the effect of the Codification on Metropolitan Lifes statutory surplus and capital. Financing. MetLife Funding, Inc. ("MetLife Funding") serves as a centralized finance unit for Metropolitan Life. Pursuant to a support agreement, Metropolitan Life has agreed to cause MetLife Funding to have a tangible net worth of at least one dollar. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, MetLife Funding had a tangible net worth of $10.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively. MetLife Funding raises funds from various funding sources and uses the proceeds to extend loans to the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life and other affiliates. MetLife Funding manages its funding sources to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of Metropolitan Life. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, MetLife Funding had total outstanding liabilities of $133 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, consisting primarily of commercial paper. The Holding Company is authorized to raise funds from various funding sources and uses the proceeds for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2001, the Holding Company had no outstanding short term debt. In November 2001, the Holding Company issued $750 million 6.125% senior notes due 2011 and $500 million 5.25% senior notes due 2006 under the shelf registration statement discussed above in " The Holding Company." The Company also maintained approximately $2.4 billion and $2 billion in committed credit facilities at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, there was approximately $24 million and $98 million, respectively, outstanding under these facilities. At December 31, 2001, $473 million in letters of credit from various banks were outstanding. Support agreements. In addition to its support agreement with MetLife Funding described above, Metropolitan Life has entered into a net worth maintenance agreement with New England Life Insurance Company ("New England Life"), whereby it is obligated to maintain New England Lifes statutory capital and surplus at the greater of $10 million or the amount necessary to prevent certain regulatory action by Massachusetts, the state of domicile of this subsidiary. The capital and surplus of New England Life at December 31, 2001 was in excess of the amount that would trigger such an event. In connection with the Companys acquisition of GenAmerica, Metropolitan Life entered into a net worth maintenance agreement with General American, whereby Metropolitan Life is obligated to maintain General Americans statutory capital and surplus at the greater of $10 million or the amount necessary to maintain the capital and surplus of General American at a level not less than 180% of the NAIC Risk Based Capitalization Model. The capital and surplus of General American at December 31, 2001 was in excess of the required amount. Metropolitan Life has also entered into arrangements with some of its other subsidiaries and affiliates to assist such subsidiaries and affiliates in meeting various jurisdictions regulatory requirements regarding capital and surplus. In addition, Metropolitan Life has entered into a support arrangement with respect to reinsurance obligations of Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity Company ("MIAC"). Management does not anticipate that these arrangements will place any significant demands upon the Companys liquidity resources. The Holding Company has agreed to make capital contributions, in any event not to exceed $120 million, to MIAC in the aggregate amount of the excess of (i) the debt service payments required to be made, and the capital expenditure payments required to be made or reserved for, under the borrowings made by MIAC subsidiaries to fund the purchase of certain real estate properties from Metropolitan Life during the two year period following the date of borrowings, over (ii) the cash flows generated by these properties. Consolidated cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,799 million, $1,299 million and $3,883 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The fluctuations in cash provided by the Companys operations between periods are primarily due to the timing in the settlement of security trades and other receivables and payables. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was more than adequate to meet liquidity requirements. 73 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(3,663) million, $309 million and $(2,389) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Purchases of investments exceeded sales, maturities and repayments by $3,289 million, $7,101 million and $461 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These net purchases were primarily attributable to the investment of collateral received in connection with the securities lending program. In addition, the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of Nvest on October 30, 2000 and the planned increase in the cash position within the investment portfolio in 2001 contributed to the variance. Cash flows from investment activities increased by $360 million, $5,840 million and $2,692 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, as a result of increased volume in the securities lending program. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $2,903 million, $(963) million and $(2,006) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2001, the primary sources of cash from financing activities were the issuance of long term debt by the Holding Company in the form of senior notes and the issuance of mandatorily convertible securities by RGA in connection with the formation of RGA Capital Trust I. The primary uses of cash in financing activities include stock repurchases, common stock cash dividends and the pay down of short term debt. In 2000, the primary sources of cash from financing activities include cash proceeds from the Companys initial public offering and concurrent private placements in April 2000, as well as the issuance of mandatorily convertible securities in connection with the formation of MetLife Capital Trust I. The primary uses of cash in financing activities include cash payments to eligible policyholders in connection with the demutualization, stock repurchases, common stock cash dividends, and the pay down of short term debt. Deposits to policyholders account balances exceeded withdrawals by $3,674 million and $386 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, as compared with withdrawals from policyholder account balances exceeding deposits of $2,222 million in 1999. Short term financing decreased by $730 million and $3,095 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, compared with an increase of $608 million in 1999, while net additions to long term debt were $1,228 million and $83 million in 2001 and 2000 compared with net reductions of $392 million in 1999. The operating, investing and financing activities described above resulted in an increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents of $4,039 million, $645 million and $(512) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. INSOLVENCY ASSESSMENTS Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed life insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Assessments levied against the Company from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2001 aggregated $2 million. The Company maintained a liability of $61 million at December 31, 2001 for future assessments in respect of currently impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. In the past five years, none of the aggregate assessments levied against MetLifes insurance subsidiaries has been material. The Company has established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that it considers adequate for assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS During 2001, the Company adopted or applied the following accounting standards: (i) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133"), (ii) SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial 74 Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities a replacement of FASB No. 125, (iii) Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Certain Investments, (iv) SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and (v) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance and Documentation Issues. Adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") continues to issue additional guidance relating to the accounting for derivatives under SFAS 133, which may result in further adjustments to the Companys treatment of derivatives in subsequent accounting periods. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). The Company is in the process of developing an estimate of the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS 144"). The adoption of SFAS 144 by the Company is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption. The FASB is currently deliberating the issuance of an interpretation of SFAS No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries, to provide additional guidance to assist companies in identifying and accounting for special purpose entities ("SPEs"), including when SPEs should be consolidated by the investor. The interpretation would introduce a concept that consolidation would be required by the primary beneficiary of the activities of an SPE unless the SPE can meet certain independent economic substance criteria. It is not possible to determine at this time what conclusions will be included in the final interpretation; however, the result could impact the accounting treatment of these entities by the Company. The FASB is currently deliberating the issuance of a proposed statement that would amend SFAS No. 133. The proposed statement will address and resolve certain pending Derivatives Implementation Group ("DIG") issues. The outcome of the pending DIG issues and other provisions of the statement could impact the Companys accounting for beneficial interests, loan commitments and other transactions deemed to be derivatives under the new statement. The Companys accounting for such transactions is currently based on managements interpretation of the accounting literature as of March 18, 2002. INVESTMENTS The Company had total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2001 of $169.7 billion. In addition, the Company had $62.7 billion held in its separate accounts, for which the Company generally does not bear investment risk. The Companys primary investment objective is to maximize after tax operating income consistent with acceptable risk parameters. The Company is exposed to three primary sources of investment risk: credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates; and market valuation risk for equity holdings. The Company manages risk through in house fundamental analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk and market valuation risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and valuation risk through geographic, property type, and product type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management strategies, product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, and proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. 75 The following table summarizes the Companys cash and invested assets at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 CARRYING % OF CARRYING % OF VALUE TOTAL VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Fixed maturities available for sale, at fair value.......................................... $115,398 68.0% $112,979 70.7% Mortgage loans on real estate.................... 23,621 13.9 21,951 13.7 Policy loans..................................... 8,272 4.9 8,158 5.1 Cash and cash equivalents........................ 7,473 4.4 3,434 2.1 Real estate and real estate joint ventures....... 5,730 3.4 5,504 3.4 Equity securities and other limited partnership interests...................................... 4,700 2.8 3,845 2.4 Other invested assets............................ 3,298 1.9 2,821 1.8 Short term investments........................... 1,203 0.7 1,269 0.8 Total cash and invested assets.............. $169,695 100.0% $159,961 100.0% 76 INVESTMENT RESULTS The annual yields on general account cash and invested assets, excluding net investment gains and losses, were 7.56%, 7.54% and 7.27% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Fixed maturity investment income has been reduced by rebates paid under the program. (2) Included in fixed maturities are equity linked notes of $1,004 million, $1,232 million and $1,079 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which include an equity like component as part of the notes return. Investment income for fixed maturities includes prepayment fees and income from the securities lending program. (3) Investment income from mortgage loans includes prepayment fees. (4) Real estate and real estate joint venture income is shown net of depreciation of $220 million, $224 million and $247 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. (5) Adjustments to investment gains and losses include amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, charges and credits to participating contracts, and adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. FIXED MATURITIES Fixed maturities consist principally of publicly traded and privately placed debt securities, and represented 68.0% and 70.7% of total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Based on estimated fair value, public fixed maturities and private fixed maturities comprised 83.7% and 16.3%, respectively, of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2001 and 83.6% and 16.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2000. The Company invests in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of its portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than can ordinarily be obtained with comparable public market securities. Generally, private placements provide the Company with protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. However, the Company may not freely trade its private placements because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets. The Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the bond investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories called "NAIC designations." The NAIC designations parallel the credit ratings of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds considered investment grade (rated "Baa3" or higher by Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys"), or rated "BBB " or higher by Standard & Poors ("S&P")) by such rating organizations. NAIC designations 3 through 6 include bonds considered below investment grade (rated "Ba1" or lower by Moodys, or rated "BB+" or lower by S&P). 78 The following table presents the Companys total fixed maturities by NAIC designation and the equivalent ratings of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations at December 31, 2001 and 2000, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair value, that each designation comprises: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 NAIC RATING AGENCY AMORTIZED ESTIMATED % OF AMORTIZED ESTIMATED % OF RATING EQUIVALENT DESIGNATION COST FAIR VALUE TOTAL COST FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ 72,098 $ 75,265 65.2% $ 72,170 $ 74,389 65.9% 2 Baa 29,128 29,581 25.6 28,470 28,405 25.1 3 Ba 6,021 5,856 5.1 5,935 5,650 5.0 4 B 3,205 3,100 2.7 3,964 3,758 3.3 5 Caa and lower 726 597 0.5 123 95 0.1 6 In or near default 327 237 0.2 319 361 0.3 Subtotal 111,505 114,636 99.3 110,981 112,658 99.7 Redeemable preferred stock 783 762 0.7 321 321 0.3 Total fixed maturities $112,288 $115,398 100.0% $111,302 $112,979 100.0% Based on estimated fair values, total investment grade public and private placement fixed maturities comprised 90.8% and 91.0% of total fixed maturities in the general account at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The following table shows the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturities, by contractual maturity dates (excluding scheduled sinking funds) at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 AMORTIZED ESTIMATED AMORTIZED ESTIMATED COST FAIR VALUE COST FAIR VALUE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Due in one year or less.................... $ 4,001 $ 4,049 $ 3,465 $ 3,460 Due after one year through five years...... 20,168 20,841 21,041 21,275 Due after five years through ten years..... 22,937 23,255 23,872 23,948 Due after ten years........................ 30,565 32,017 29,564 30,402 Subtotal.............................. 77,671 80,162 77,942 79,085 Mortgage backed and other asset backed securities............................... 33,834 34,474 33,039 33,573 Subtotal.............................. 111,505 114,636 110,981 112,658 Redeemable preferred stock................. 783 762 321 321 Total fixed maturities................ $112,288 $115,398 $111,302 $112,979 Problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities. The Company monitors fixed maturities to identify investments that management considers to be problems or potential problems. The Company also monitors investments that have been restructured. The Company defines problem securities in the fixed maturities category as securities as to which principal or interest payments are in default or are to be restructured pursuant to commenced negotiations, or as securities issued by a debtor that has entered into bankruptcy. 79 The Company defines potential problem securities in the fixed maturity category as securities of an issuer deemed to be experiencing significant operating problems or difficult industry conditions. The Company uses various criteria, including the following, to identify potential problem securities: debt service coverage or cash flow falling below certain thresholds which vary according to the issuers industry and other relevant factors; significant declines in revenues or margins; violation of financial covenants; public securities trading at a substantial discount deemed to be other than temporary as a result of specific credit concerns; and other subjective factors. The Company defines restructured securities in the fixed maturities category as securities to which the Company has granted a concession that it would not have otherwise considered but for the financial difficulties of the obligor. The Company enters into a restructuring when it believes it will realize a greater economic value under the new terms rather than through liquidation or disposition. The terms of the restructuring may involve some or all of the following characteristics: a reduction in the interest rate, an extension of the maturity date, an exchange of debt for equity or a partial forgiveness of principal or interest. The following table presents the estimated fair value of the Companys total fixed maturities classified as performing, problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 ESTIMATED % OF ESTIMATED % OF FAIR VALUE TOTAL FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Performing....................................... $114,879 99.6% $112,371 99.5% Potential Problem................................ 386 0.3 364 0.3 Problem.......................................... 111 0.1 163 0.1 Restructured..................................... 22 0.0 81 0.1 Total....................................... $115,398 100.0% $112,979 100.0% The Company classifies all of its fixed maturities as available for sale and marks them to market. The Company writes down to fair value fixed maturities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired. The Company records write downs as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed maturities accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. Such write downs were $273 million and $339 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 80 Fixed maturities by sector. The Company diversifies its fixed maturities by security sector. The following table sets forth the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed maturities by sector, as well as the percentage of the total fixed maturities holdings that each security sector comprised at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 ESTIMATED % OF ESTIMATED % OF FAIR VALUE TOTAL FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) U.S. treasuries/agencies......................... $ 9,213 8.0% $ 9,634 8.5% Corporate securities............................. 62,656 54.3 60,675 53.8 Foreign government securities.................... 4,890 4.2 5,341 4.7 Mortgage backed securities....................... 26,328 22.8 25,726 22.8 Asset backed securities.......................... 8,146 7.1 7,847 6.9 Other fixed income assets........................ 4,165 3.6 3,756 3.3 Total....................................... $115,398 100.0% $112,979 100.0% Corporate fixed maturities.

The Company diversifies its corporate bond holdings by industry and issuer. The portfolio has no exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of its total invested assets. At December 31, 2001, the Companys combined holdings in the ten issuers to which it had the greatest exposure totaled $4,176 million, which was less than 3% of the Companys total invested assets at such date. The exposure to the largest single issuer of corporate bonds the Company held at December 31, 2001 was $598 million. At December 31, 2001, investments of $7,120 million, or 48.2% of the Yankee/Foreign sector, represented exposure to traditional Yankee bonds. The balance of this exposure was primarily dollar denominated, foreign private placements and project finance loans. The Company diversifies the Yankee/Foreign portfolio by country and issuer. The Company does not have material exposure to foreign currency risk in its invested assets. In the Companys international insurance operations, both its assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies. Foreign currency denominated securities supporting U.S. dollar liabilities are generally swapped back into U.S. dollars. The Companys exposure to future deterioration in the economic and political environment in Argentina, with respect to its Argentine related investments, is limited to the net carrying value of those assets, which totaled less than $300 million as of December 31, 2001. 81 Mortgage backed securities. The following table shows the types of mortgage backed securities the Company held at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 ESTIMATED % OF ESTIMATED % OF FAIR VALUE TOTAL FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Pass through securities.......................... $10,542 40.0% $10,610 41.3% Collateralized mortgage obligations.............. 10,432 39.7 9,866 38.3 Commercial mortgage backed securities............ 5,354 20.3 5,250 20.4 Total....................................... $26,328 100.0% $25,726 100.0% At December 31, 2001, pass through and collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $20,974 million, or 79.7% of total mortgage backed securities, and a majority of this amount represented agency issued pass through and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Government National Mortgage Association. Other types of mortgage backed securities comprised the balance of such amounts reflected in the table. At December 31, 2001, approximately $2,955 million, or 55.2% of the commercial mortgage backed securities, and $20,194 million, or 96.3% of the pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, were rated Aaa/ AAA by Moodys or S&P. The principal risks inherent in holding mortgage backed securities are prepayment, extension and collateral risks, which will affect the timing of when cash flow will be received. The Companys active monitoring of its mortgage backed securities mitigates exposure to losses from cash flow risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. Asset backed securities. Asset backed securities, which include home equity loans, credit card receivables, collateralized debt obligations and automobile receivables, are purchased both to diversify the overall risks of the Companys fixed maturities assets and to provide attractive returns. The Companys asset backed securities are diversified both by type of asset and by issuer. Home equity loans constitute the largest exposure in the Companys asset backed securities investments. Except for asset backed securities backed by home equity loans, the asset backed securities investments generally have little sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Approximately $3,427 million and $3,149 million, or 42.1% and 40.1%, of total asset backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys or S&P at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The principal risks in holding asset backed securities are structural, credit and capital market risks. Structural risks include the securitys priority in the issuers capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks include consumer or corporate credits such as credit card holders, equipment lessees, and corporate obligors. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates and the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace. Structured investment transactions. The Company participates in structured investment transactions as part of its risk management strategy, including asset liability management, and to enhance the Companys total return on its investment portfolio. These investments are predominately made through bankruptcy remote SPEs, which generally acquire financial assets, including corporate equities, debt securities and purchased options. These investments are referred to as beneficial interests. The Companys exposure to losses related to these SPEs is limited to its carrying value since the Company has not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the SPEs. As prescribed by GAAP, the Company does not consolidate such SPEs since unrelated third parties hold controlling interests through ownership of the SPEs equity, representing at least three percent of the total assets of the SPE throughout the life of the SPE, and such equity class has the substantive risks and rewards of the residual interests in the SPE. 82 The Company also sponsors financial asset securitizations of high yield debt securities, investment grade bonds and structured finance securities and also is the collateral manager and a beneficial interest holder in such transactions. As the collateral manager, the Company earns a management fee on the outstanding securitized asset balance. When the Company transfers assets to an SPE and surrenders control over the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a sale. Gains or losses on securitizations are determined with reference to the carrying amount of the financial assets transferred, which is allocated to the assets sold and the beneficial interests retained based on relative fair values at the date of transfer. The Company has sponsored four securitizations with a total of approximately $1.5 billion in financial assets as of December 31, 2001. Two of these transactions, which were executed in 2001, included the transfer of assets totaling approximately $289 million which resulted in the recognition of an insignificant amount of investment gains. The Companys beneficial interests in these SPEs and the related investment income were insignificant as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Company also invests in structured investment transactions which are managed and controlled by unrelated third parties. In instances where the Company exercises significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an SPE, the beneficial interests are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting. Where the Company does not exercise significant influence, the structure of the beneficial interests (i.e., debt or equity securities) determines the method of accounting for the investment. Such beneficial interests generally are structured notes, which are classified as fixed maturities, and the related income is recognized using the retrospective interest method. Beneficial interests other than structured notes are also classified as fixed maturities, and the related income is recognized using the level yield method. The carrying value of all such investments was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The related income recognized was $44 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. MORTGAGE LOANS The Companys mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. Mortgage loans comprised 13.9% and 13.7% of the Companys total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The carrying value of mortgage loans is stated at original cost net of prepayments, amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and valuation allowances.

The Company monitors its mortgage loan investments on a continual basis. Through this monitoring process, the Company reviews loans that are restructured, delinquent or under foreclosure and identifies those that management considers to be potentially delinquent. These loan classifications are generally consistent with those used in industry practice. 84 The Company defines restructured mortgage loans, consistent with industry practice, as loans in which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtors financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. This definition provides for loans to exit the restructured category under certain conditions. The Company defines delinquent mortgage loans, consistent with industry practice, as loans in which two or more interest or principal payments are past due. The Company defines mortgage loans under foreclosure, consistent with industry practice, as loans in which foreclosure proceedings have formally commenced. The Company defines potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in managements opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent. The Company reviews all mortgage loans on an annual basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis and tenant creditworthiness. The Company also reviews loan to value ratios and debt coverage ratios for restructured loans, delinquent loans, loans under foreclosure, potentially delinquent loans, loans with an existing valuation allowance, loans maturing within two years and loans with a loan to value ratio greater than 90% as determined in the prior year. The Company establishes valuation allowances for loans that it deems impaired, as determined through its annual review process. The Company defines impaired loans consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as loans which it probably will not collect all amounts due according to applicable contractual terms of the agreement. The Company bases valuation allowances upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the value of the loans collateral. The Company records valuation allowances as investment losses. The Company records subsequent adjustments to allowances as investment gains or losses. The following table presents the amortized cost and valuation allowances for commercial mortgage loans distributed by loan classification at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 % OF % OF AMORTIZED % OF VALUATION AMORTIZED AMORTIZED % OF VALUATION AMORTIZED COST(1) TOTAL ALLOWANCE COST COST(1) TOTAL ALLOWANCE COST (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Performing......................... $17,495 96.6% $ 52 0.3% $16,169 95.5% $15 0.1% Restructured....................... 448 2.5 55 12.3% 646 3.8 47 7.3% Delinquent or under foreclosure.... 14 0.1 7 50.0% 24 0.1 4 16.7% Potentially delinquent............. 136 0.8 20 14.7% 106 0.6 10 9.4% Total.......................... $18,093 100.0% $134 0.7% $16,945 100.0% $76 0.4% (1) Amortized cost is equal to carrying value before valuation allowances.

(26) (54) (109) Balance, end of period...................................... $134 $ 76 $ 69 The principal risks in holding commercial mortgage loans are property specific, supply and demand, financial and capital market risks. Property specific risks include the geographic location of the property, the physical condition of the property, the diversity of tenants and the rollover of their leases and the ability of the property manager to attract tenants and manage expenses. Supply and demand risks include changes in the supply 85 and or demand for rental space which cause changes in vacancy rates and or rental rates. Financial risks include the overall level of debt on the property and the amount of principal repaid during the loan term. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates, the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace and the capital available loan for refinancing. Agricultural mortgage loans. The Company diversifies its agricultural mortgage loans by both geographic region and product type. The Company manages these investments through a network of regional offices and field professionals overseen by its investment department. Approximately 61.9% of the $5,268 million of agricultural mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2001 was subject to rate resets prior to maturity. A substantial portion of these loans were successfully renegotiated and remain outstanding to maturity. The process and policies for monitoring the agricultural mortgage loans and classifying them by performance status are generally the same as those for the commercial loans. The following table presents the amortized cost and valuation allowances for agricultural mortgage loans distributed by loan classification at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 % OF % OF AMORTIZED % OF VALUATION AMORTIZED AMORTIZED % OF VALUATION AMORTIZED COST(1) TOTAL ALLOWANCE COST COST(1) TOTAL ALLOWANCE COST (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Performing......................... $ 5,055 95.8% $ 3 0.1% $ 4,771 95.7% $ 1 0.0% Restructured....................... 188 3.6 3 1.6% 172 3.5 2 1.2% Delinquent or under foreclosure.... 29 0.5 2 6.9% 24 0.5 4 16.7% Potentially delinquent............. 5 0.1 1 20.0% 13 0.3 0.0% Total.......................... $ 5,277 100.0% $ 9 0.2% $ 4,980 100.0% $ 7 0.1% (1) Amortized cost is equal to carrying value before valuation allowances.

Property specific risks include the geographic location of the property, soil types, weather conditions and other factors that may impact the borrowers guaranty. Supply and demand risks include the supply and demand for the commodities produced on the specific property and the related price for those commodities. Financial risks include the overall level of debt on the property and the amount of principal repaid during the loan term. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates, the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace and the capital available for loan refinancing. REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES The Companys real estate and real estate joint venture investments consist of commercial and agricultural properties located throughout the U.S. and Canada. The Company manages these investments through a network of regional offices overseen by its investment department. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of the Companys real estate and real estate joint ventures was $5,730 and $5,504 million, respectively, or 3.4% of 86 total cash and invested assets in both years. The carrying value of equity real estate was stated at depreciated cost net of impairments and valuation allowances. The carrying value of real estate joint ventures was stated at the Companys equity in the real estate joint ventures net of impairments and valuation allowances. These holdings consist of real estate, interests in real estate joint ventures and real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans. The following table presents the carrying value of the Companys real estate and real estate joint ventures at December 31, 2001 and 2000: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 CARRYING % OF CARRYING % OF TYPE VALUE TOTAL VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Real estate........................................ $5,325 92.9% $5,069 92.1% Real estate joint ventures......................... 356 6.2 369 6.7 Subtotal...................................... 5,681 99.1 5,438 98.8 Foreclosed real estate............................. 49 0.9 66 1.2 Total......................................... $5,730 100.0% $5,504 100.0% Office properties representing 63.5% and 66.1% of the Companys real estate and real estate joint venture holdings at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, are well diversified geographically, principally within the United States. The average occupancy level of office properties was 92% and 94% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company classifies real estate and real estate joint ventures as held for investment or held for sale. The carrying value of real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment was $5,633 million and $5,223 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The carrying value of real estate and real estate joint ventures held for sale was $97 million and $281 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Ongoing management of these investments includes quarterly valuations, as well as an annual market update and review of each propertys budget, financial returns, lease rollover status and the Companys exit strategy. In addition to individual property reviews, the Company employs an overall strategy of selective dispositions and acquisitions as market opportunities arise. The Company adjusts the carrying value of real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the property may not be recoverable. The Company writes down impaired real estate to estimated fair value, which it generally computes using the present value of future cash flows from the property, discounted at a rate commensurate with the underlying risks. The Company records write downs as investment losses and reduces the cost basis of the properties accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. The Company records real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at the lower of estimated fair value or the carrying value of the mortgage loan at the date of foreclosure. Once the Company identifies a property to be sold and commences a firm plan for marketing the property, the Company establishes and periodically revises, if necessary, a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying value of the property to its expected sales value, less associated selling costs, if it is lower than the propertys carrying value. The Company records allowances as investment losses. The Company records subsequent adjustments to allowances as investment gains or losses. The Companys carrying value of real estate and real estate joint ventures held for sale, including real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, in the amounts of $97 million and $281 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, are net of impairments of $88 million and $97 million and net of valuation allowances of $35 million and $39 million, respectively. 87 EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS The Companys carrying value of equity securities, which primarily consists of investments in common stocks, was $3,063 million and $2,193 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Substantially all of the common stock is publicly traded on major securities exchanges. The carrying value of the other limited partnership interests (which primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment funds that make private equity investments in companies in the U.S. and overseas) was $1,637 million and $1,652 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company classifies its investments in common stocks as available for sale and marks them to market except for non marketable private equities which are generally carried at cost. The Company accounts for its investments in limited partnership interests in which it does not have a controlling interest in accordance with the equity method of accounting. The Companys investments in equity securities represented 1.8% and 1.4% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Equity securities include, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, $329 million and $577 million, respectively, of private equity securities. The Company may not freely trade its private equity securities because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, approximately $238 million and $313 million, respectively, of the Companys equity securities holdings were effectively fixed at a minimum value of $195 million and $257 million, respectively, primarily through the use of exchangeable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2001, two exchangeable subordinated debt securities matured, resulting in a gross investment gain of $44 million on the equity exchanged in satisfaction of the note. The remaining exchangeable debt security issued by the Company matures in 2002 and the Company may repurchase it prior to maturity at its discretion. The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were $1,898 million and $1,311 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company anticipates that these amounts will be invested in the partnerships over the next three to five years. PROBLEM AND POTENTIAL PROBLEM EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS The Company monitors its equity securities and other limited partnership interests on a continual basis. Through this monitoring process, the Company identifies investments that management considers to be problems or potential problems. Problem equity securities and other limited partnership interests are defined as securities (i) in which significant declines in revenues and or margins threaten the ability of the issuer to continue operating, or (ii) where the issuer has subsequently entered bankruptcy. Potential problem equity securities and other limited partnership interests are defined as securities issued by a company that is experiencing significant operating problems or difficult industry conditions. Criteria generally indicative of these problems or conditions are (i) cash flows falling below varying thresholds established for the industry and other relevant factors, (ii) significant declines in revenues and or margins, (iii) public securities trading at a substantial discount compared to original cost as a result of specific credit concerns, and (iv) other information that becomes available. Equity securities or other limited partnership interests which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired are written down to fair value. Write downs are recorded as investment losses and the cost basis of the equity securities and other limited partnership interests are adjusted accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, such write downs were $142 million and $18 million, respectively. OTHER INVESTED ASSETS The Companys other invested assets consist principally of leveraged leases and funds withheld at interest of $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The leveraged leases are recorded net 88 of non recourse debt. The Company participates in lease transactions which are diversified by geographic area. The Company regularly reviews residual values and writes down residuals to expected values as needed. Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. For agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets equal to the net statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company. Interest accrues to these funds withheld at rates defined by the treaty terms. The Companys other invested assets represented 1.9% and 1.8% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative instruments to manage market risk through one of four principal risk management strategies: the hedging of invested assets, liabilities, portfolios of assets or liabilities and anticipated transactions. Additionally, Metropolitan Life enters into income generation and replication derivative transactions as permitted by its derivatives use plan that was approved by the Department. The Companys derivative hedging strategy employs a variety of instruments including financial futures, financial forwards, interest rate and foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange contracts, and options, including caps and floors. The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash flow hedges, when they have met the effectiveness requirements of SFAS 133: (i) various types of interest rate swaps to convert floating rate investments to fixed rate investments, (ii) receive fixed foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency denominated investments, (iii) foreign currency forwards to hedge the exposure of future payments in foreign currencies, and (iv) other instruments to hedge the cash flows of various other anticipated transactions. For all qualifying and highly effective cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are reported in net investment gains or losses. Hedged forecasted transactions, other than the receipt or payment of variable interest payments, are not expected to occur more than 12 months after hedge inception. The Company designates and accounts for the following as fair value hedges, when they have met the effectiveness requirements of SFAS 133: (i) various types of interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate investments to floating rate investments, (ii) receive floating foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated investments, and (iii) other instruments to hedge various other fair value exposures of investments. For all qualifying and highly effective fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are reported as net investment gains or losses. In addition, changes in fair value attributable to the hedged portion of the underlying instrument are reported in net investment gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the amount related to fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant and there were no discontinued fair value or cash flow hedges. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized net investment income of $32 million, $13 million and $0.3 million, respectively, from the periodic settlement of interest rate and foreign currency swaps. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized other comprehensive income of $39 million relating to the effective portion of cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2001, the accumulated amount in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges was $71 million. During the year ended December 31, 2001, $19 million of other comprehensive income was reclassified into net investment income primarily due to the SFAS 133 transition adjustment. During the next year, other comprehensive income of $17 million related to cash flow hedges is expected to be reclassified into net investment income. The reclassifications are recognized over the life of the hedged item. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized net investment income of $24 million and net investment gains of $100 million from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges. The use of these non speculative derivatives is permitted by the Department. 89 The Company held the following positions in derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 CURRENT MARKET CURRENT MARKET OR FAIR VALUE OR FAIR VALUE CARRYING NOTIONAL CARRYING NOTIONAL VALUE AMOUNT ASSETS LIABILITIES VALUE AMOUNT ASSETS LIABILITIES (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Financial futures.................. $ $ $ $ $ 23 $ 254 $ 23 $ Interest rate swaps................ 70 1,849 79 9 41 1,450 41 1 Floors............................. 11 325 11 325 3 Caps............................... 5 7,890 5 9,950 Foreign currency swaps............. 162 1,925 188 26 (1) 1,449 114 44 Exchange traded options............

The Companys policy requires a minimum of 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities as collateral, calculated on a daily basis. The Companys securities on loan at December 31, 2001 and 2000 had estimated fair values of $14,404 million and $12,289 million, respectively. SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS The Company manages each separate accounts assets in accordance with the prescribed investment policy that applies to that specific separate account. The Company establishes separate accounts on a single client and multi client commingled basis in conformity with insurance laws. Generally, separate accounts are not chargeable with liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account assets are subject to the Companys general account claims only to the extent that the value of such assets exceeds the separate account liabilities, as defined by the accounts contract. If the Company uses a separate account to support a contract providing guaranteed benefits, the Company must comply with the asset maintenance requirements stipulated under Regulation 128 of the New York Insurance Department. The Company monitors these requirements at least monthly and, in addition, performs cash flow analyses, similar to that conducted for the general account, on an annual basis. The Company reports separately as assets and liabilities investments held in separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts. The Company reports substantially all separate account assets at their fair market value. Investment income and gains or losses on the investments of separate accounts accrue directly to contract holders, and, accordingly, the Company does not reflect them in its consolidated statements of income and cash flows. The Company reflects in its revenues fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy administration fees, investment management fees and surrender charges. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the market risk associated with its invested assets and interest rate sensitive insurance contracts. It has developed an integrated process for managing risk, which it conducts through its Corporate Risk Management Department, several asset/liability committees and additional specialists at the business segment level. The Company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility. 90 MARKET RISK EXPOSURES The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities. For purposes of this disclosure, "market risk" is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates. Interest rates. The Companys exposure to interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of fixed maturities, as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturities include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term treasury rates. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include guaranteed interest contracts and fixed annuities, which have the same interest rate exposure (medium and long term treasury rates) as the fixed maturities. The Company employs product design, pricing and asset/liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products. Asset/liability management strategies include the use of derivatives, the purchase of securities structured to protect against prepayments, prepayment restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent monitoring of the pricing of the Companys products in order to better match the duration of the assets and the liabilities they support. Equity prices. The Companys investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity prices. It manages this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through its asset/liability management strategies. The Company also manages equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. Foreign exchange rates. The Companys exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from its holdings in non U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity securities and equity securities and through its investments in foreign subsidiaries. The principal currencies which create foreign exchange rate risk in the Companys investment portfolios are Canadian dollars, Euros, Mexican pesos, Chilean pesos and British pounds. The Company mitigates the majority of its fixed maturities foreign exchange rate risk through the utilization of foreign currency swaps and forward contracts. Through its investments in foreign subsidiaries, the Company is primarily exposed to the Euro, Mexican peso and South Korean won. The Company has denominated substantially all assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies, thereby minimizing its risk to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. RISK MANAGEMENT Corporate risk management. MetLife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process. These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve asset/liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards. MetLife also has a separate Corporate Risk Management Department, which is responsible for risk throughout MetLife and reports directly to Metropolitan Lifes Chief Actuary. The Corporate Risk Management Departments primary responsibilities consist of: implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework, which outlines the Companys approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis; developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring and monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk framework; establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels; deploying capital on a risk adjusted basis; and reporting on a periodic basis to the Audit Committee of the Holding Companys board of directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees. Asset/liability management. At MetLife, asset/liability management is the responsibility of the General Account Portfolio Management Department ("GAPM"), the operating business segments and various GAPM boards. The GAPM boards are comprised of senior officers from the investment department, senior managers from each business segment and the Chief Actuary. The GAPM boards duties include setting broad asset/ 91 liability management policy and strategy, reviewing and approving target portfolios, establishing investment guidelines and limits, and providing oversight of the portfolio management process. The portfolio managers and asset sector specialists, who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities, implement the goals and objectives established by the GAPM boards. The goals of the investment process are to optimize after tax, risk adjusted investment income and after tax, risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The risk management objectives established by the GAPM boards stress quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity and investment return. Each of MetLifes business segments has an asset/liability officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment department to monitor investment, product pricing, hedge strategy and liability management issues. MetLife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product, which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. These strategies include objectives for effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality. To manage interest rate risk, the Company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements. These projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the Companys in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. The Company has developed models of its in force business that reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality and interest crediting rates. In addition, these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage prepayments and defaults. New York Insurance Department regulations require that MetLife perform some of these analyses annually as part of the annual proof of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves to meet adverse interest rate scenarios. Hedging activities. MetLifes risk management strategies incorporate the use of various interest rate derivatives that are used to adjust the overall duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities to reduce interest rate risk. Such instruments include interest rate swaps, futures and caps. MetLife also uses foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments. RISK MEASUREMENT; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments, including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts ("other financial instruments"), based on changes in interest rates, equity prices and currency exchange rates, utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value, cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, equity prices and currency exchange rates. The Company believes that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term. In performing this analysis, the Company used market rates at December 31, 2001 to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of MetLifes market risk exposures (interest rate, equity price and currency exchange rate) related to its non trading invested assets and other financial instruments. The Company does not maintain a trading portfolio. The sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above. The Company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets, earnings and cash flows as follows: Fair values. The Company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change (increase or decrease) in: the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates; the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of the Companys currency exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in currency exchange rates; and the market value of its equity positions due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity prices. 92 Earnings and cash flows. MetLife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and equity prices. The following factors were incorporated into the earnings and cash flows sensitivity analyses: the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities; the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities; the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each 10% change (increase or decrease) in the interest rates; and the expected turnover (sales) of fixed maturities and equity securities, including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds. The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future financial performance. The Company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include: the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages; the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year. Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset/liability management personnel. Based on its analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and prices, MetLife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets. The equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the Company to material market risk. The table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000. In addition, the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the Companys equity price sensitive positions at December 31, 2001 and 2000 is set forth in the table below. The potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the Companys portfolio, all of which is non trading, for the periods indicated was: AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Interest rate risk.......................................... $3,430 $3,959 Equity price risk........................................... $ 228 $ 181 Currency exchange rate risk................................. $ 521 $ 302 The change in potential loss in fair value related to market risk exposure between December 31, 2001 and 2000 was primarily attributable to a shift in the yield curve. 93
