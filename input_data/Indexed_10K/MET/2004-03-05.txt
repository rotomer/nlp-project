ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For purposes of this discussion, the terms "MetLife" or the "Company" refers to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Holding Company"), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("Metropolitan Life"). Following this summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. ECONOMIC CAPITAL Beginning in 2003, the Company changed its methodology of allocating capital to its business segments from Risk Based Capital ("RBC") to Economic Capital. Prior to 2003, the Companys business segments allocated equity was primarily based on RBC, an internally developed formula based on applying a multiple to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Statutory Risk Based Capital and included certain adjustments in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Economic Capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The Economic Capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLifes businesses. This is in contrast to the standardized regulatory RBC formula, which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the Companys businesses. The change in methodology is being applied prospectively. This change has and will continue to impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the Companys business segments. A portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity. This change in 41 methodology of allocating equity does not impact the Companys consolidated net investment income or net income. The following table presents actual and pro forma net investment income with respect to the Companys segments for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The amounts shown as pro forma reflect net investment income that would have been reported in these years had the Company allocated capital based on Economic Capital rather than on the basis of RBC.

The transaction closed during the fourth quarter of 2003 with an effective date retroactive to July 1, 2003. The transaction added approximately $278 billion of life reinsurance in force, $246 million of premium and $11 million of income before income tax expense, excluding minority interest expense, to the fourth quarter of 2003. In June 2002, the Company acquired Aseguradora Hidalgo S.A. ("Hidalgo"), an insurance company based in Mexico with approximately $2.5 billion in assets as of the date of acquisition. The Companys existing Mexico subsidiary and Hidalgo now operate as a combined entity under the name MetLife Mexico. In November 2001, the Company acquired Compania de Seguros de Vida Santander S.A. and Compania de Reaseguros de Vida Soince Re S.A., wholly owned subsidiaries of Santander Central Hispano in Chile. These acquisitions marked MetLifes entrance into the Chilean insurance market. In July 2001, the Company completed its sale of Conning Corporation ("Conning"), an affiliate acquired in the acquisition of GenAmerica Financial Corporation ("GenAmerica") in 2000. Conning specialized in asset management for insurance company investment portfolios and investment research. SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies, estimates and related judgments underlying the Companys consolidated financial statements are summarized below. In applying these policies, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Companys businesses and operations. 42 INVESTMENTS The Companys principal investments are in fixed maturities, mortgage loans and real estate, all of which are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk: credit, interest rate and market valuation. The financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income, as well as the determination of fair values. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on managements case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities; and (vii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. In addition, the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions, which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets. The determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on: (i) valuation methodologies; (ii) securities the Company deems to be comparable; and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. In addition, the Company enters into certain structured investment transactions, real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships for which the Company may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary and, therefore, may be required to consolidate such investments. The accounting rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity, an estimate of the entitys expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party. DERIVATIVES The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions primarily to manage the risk associated with variability in cash flows or changes in fair values related to the Companys financial assets and liabilities or to changing fair values. The Company also uses derivative instruments to hedge its currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations. The Company also purchases investment securities, issues certain insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that embed derivatives. The associated financial statement risk is the volatility in net income which can result from (i) changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as accounting hedges; (ii) ineffectiveness of designated hedges; and (iii) counterparty default. In addition, there is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation are not identified and reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Accounting for derivatives is complex, as evidenced by significant authoritative interpretations of the primary accounting standards which continue to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in determining fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate in the circumstances. Such assumptions include estimated volatility and interest rates used in the determination of fair value where quoted market values are not available. The use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS The Company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. These costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of that business, are deferred. The recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. The amount of future profit is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, 43 mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. The aforementioned factors enter into managements estimates of gross margins and profits, which generally are used to amortize such costs. Revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross margins and profits are less than amounts deferred. In addition, the Company utilizes the reversion to the mean assumption, a standard industry practice, in its determination of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), including value of business acquired ("VOBA"). This practice assumes that the expectation for long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but that it does change when large interim deviations have occurred. FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance, annuities and disability insurance. Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time and liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns and inflation. The Company also establishes liabilities for unpaid claims and claims expenses for property and casualty insurance. Liabilities for property and casualty insurance are dependent on estimates of amounts payable for claims reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are influenced by historical experience and actuarial assumptions with respect to current developments, anticipated trends and risk management strategies. Differences between the actual experience and assumptions used in pricing these policies and in the establishment of liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses. REINSURANCE The Company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance. Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously. Additionally, for each of its reinsurance contracts, the Company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company must review all contractual features, particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If the Company determines that a reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting. LITIGATION The Company is a party to a number of legal actions. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on the Companys consolidated financial position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including the Companys asbestos related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables used to determine amounts recorded. The data and variables that impact the assumption used to estimate the Companys asbestos related liability include the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease, the jurisdiction of claims filed, tort reform efforts and the 44 impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the Companys litigation, including asbestos related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the Companys consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. The reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the Company. Management determines these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data, historical performance of the plan and its assets, and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities. The actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the Companys aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations, but does change when large interim deviations occur. These assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements and liquidity. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 THE COMPANY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY MetLife, Inc., through its affiliates and subsidiaries, is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to a broad spectrum of individual and institutional customers. The Company offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners insurance and mutual funds to individuals, as well as group insurance, reinsurance, and retirement and savings products and services to corporations and other institutions. The MetLife companies serve approximately 13 million households in the U.S. and provide benefits to approximately 37 million employees and family members through their plan sponsors including 88 of the FORTUNE 100 largest companies. MetLife, Inc. also has direct international insurance operations in 10 countries serving approximately 8 million customers. MetLife is organized into six business segments: Institutional, Individual, Auto & Home, International, Reinsurance and Asset Management. The marketplace for financial services is extremely competitive. MetLife, the largest life insurer in the United States, reported $2.2 billion in net income and diluted earnings per share of $2.94 for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, after a three year economic slowdown, there were improvements in both the credit and equity markets. At the same time, interest rates remained at historic lows and the S&P 500 Index was up 26% for the year. Total premiums and fees increased to $23.2 billion, up 9% over the prior year, which primarily stems from continued sales growth across most of the Companys segments, as well as the positive impact of the U.S. financial markets on policy fees. Assets under management grew to $350.2 billion, up 17% over the prior year, and Individual annuity deposits grew to $11.2 billion, up 42% over the prior year. MetLife generated over $11 billion of net investment income while adhering to rigorous asset liability management principles and portfolio diversification. An increase in expenses year over year is primarily attributable to employee related expenses, including pension and postretirement benefit expense and severance, expenses associated with strengthening the Companys distribution systems and taking action in consolidating office space and reducing redundancies, while continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure. In addition, regulatory capital increased and the Company repurchased stock through its buyback program. 45 INDUSTRY TRENDS The Companys segments continue to be influenced by a variety of industry trends and it is the Companys belief that each of its businesses is well positioned to capitalize on those trends. In general, the Company is seeing more employers, both large and small, outsourcing their benefits functions. Further, companies are offering broader new arrays of voluntary benefits to help retain employees while adding little to their overall benefits costs. These trends will likely continue and in fact expand across companies of all sizes. Employers are also demanding substantial online access for their employees for various self service functions. This functionality requires substantial information technology investment that smaller companies will find difficult to absorb. This will put pressure on those smaller and mid size companies to gain scale quickly or exit the business. In addition, alternative benefit structures, such as simple fixed benefit products, are becoming more popular as the traditional medical indemnity products costs have continued to increase rapidly. These low cost fixed benefit products can provide effective catastrophic protection for high cost illnesses to supplement the basic health coverage provided by medical indemnity insurance. From a demographics standpoint, the bulk of the U.S. population is moving from an asset accumulation phase to an asset distribution phase. People within ten years of retirement hold significant assets. With continually lengthening lifespans and unstructured asset distribution, the Company believes many of these people may outlive their retirement savings and or require long term care. As a result, the Company expects that the demand for retirement payout solutions with guarantees will increase dramatically over the next decade. The combination of these trends will favor those with scale, breadth of distribution and product, ability to provide advice and financial strength to support the long term guarantees.

(26) Net income.................................................. $ 2,217 $ 1,605 38% Income from continuing operations increased by $809 million, or 71%, to $1,943 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,134 million in the comparable 2002 period. Income from continuing operations for the years 2003 and 2002 includes the impact of certain transactions or events that result in net income not being indicative of future earnings, which are described in the applicable segments results of operations discussions. These items contributed an after tax benefit of $159 million in 2003 and an after tax charge of $150 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of these items, income from continuing operations increased by $500 million in 2003 compared to the prior year. Declines in after tax net investment losses account for $220 million of this increase with the balance being contributed by the Companys operations. The decline in net investment losses is largely attributable to less credit related losses, which is consistent with the U.S. financial market environment. The Company anticipates net investment losses in 2004 to be comparable with 2003 levels and continues to reflect a concentration of interest related losses rather than credit related losses. Premiums, fees and other revenues increased 9% over the prior year primarily as a result of growth in the annuities, retirement and savings and variable and universal life product lines. This increase stems in part from policy fee income earned on annuity deposits, which were $11.2 billion in 2003, increasing 42% from the prior year. In addition, the annuity separate account balance was $28.7 billion at December 31, 2003, up 57% versus the prior year end. Growth in retirement & savings is primarily attributable to higher sales in structured settlement products. Fee income from variable and universal life products increased 12% over the prior year primarily as a result of a 25% growth in separate account balances. In addition, the coinsurance agreement with Allianz Life in the Reinsurance segment contributed approximately 1% to the year over year increase. Partially offsetting these increases is a decline in traditional life premiums, which is largely attributable to run off in the Companys closed block of business. Investment margins, which represent the spread between net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances, remained favorable in 2003 as the Company took appropriate crediting rate reductions in most products in an effort to keep pace with the market environment. In several product lines, where investment margins are a substantial part of earnings, the Company still has a reasonable amount of flexibility to reduce crediting rates further if portfolio yields were to decline from year end 2003 levels. Investment margins in 2003 did benefit from higher than expected levels of prepayments, a trend that is not expected to continue in 2004. 47 Underwriting results varied in 2003. The group life mortality ratio continues to be favorable at 92%. The Individual life mortality ratio was also solid at 88%, which includes the impact of several large claims in the variable and universal product line, some of which had lower levels of reinsurance. Group disabilitys morbidity ratio increased to 98.5%, from 97.9% in the prior year but is still within managements expected range. The Auto & Home combined ratio, which is a measure of both the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, as well as the expense ratio, remained favorable at 97.1% excluding catastrophes. The Companys International segment increased its loss recognition reserve in Taiwan as a result of low interest rates relative to product guarantees. This action resulted in a $19 million after tax charge. Other expenses increased 4% over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase of $133 million in pension and postretirement expenses. As a result of contributions made to the pension plan in late 2003 and early 2004, which totaled approximately $750 million, and the stronger performance of the pension plan assets in 2003, the Company anticipates the pension and postretirement expenses to moderate in 2004. Other expenses in 2003 also include the impact of several actions taken by management in the fourth quarter, including lease terminations, office consolidations and closures, and asset impairments. In addition, severance costs and expenses associated with strategic initiatives at New England Financial contributed to the increase in expenses year over year. Also, there was an increase in many of the product lines volume related expenses, which are in line with 2003 business growth. Net investment losses decreased by $393 million, or 52%, to $358 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $751 million for the comparable 2002 period. This decrease reflects total investment losses, before offsets, of $573 million. The Companys investment gains and losses are net of related policyholder amounts. The amounts netted against investment gains and losses are (i) amortization of DAC, to the extent that such amortization results from investment gains and losses, (ii) adjustments to participating contractholder accounts when amounts equal to such investment gains and losses are applied to the contractholders accounts, and (iii) adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. Offsets include the amortization of DAC of $31 million and ($5) million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation of $144 million and $157 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and adjustments to participating contracts of $40 million and ($7) million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The dollar amount of the offsets may vary disproportionately with net investment gains and losses based on the relationship of the underlying sold securities to certain insurance products. The Company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its performance. Investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers. The Company believes its presentation enables readers to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its performance. The Companys presentation of investment gains and losses, net of policyholder amounts, may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies and, therefore, amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $687 million, or 26% of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting, compared with $502 million, or 31%, for the comparable 2002 period. The 2003 effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income, tax credits for investments in low income housing, a recovery of prior year tax overpayments on tax exempt bonds, and an adjustment consisting primarily of a revision in the estimate of income taxes for 2002. In addition, the 2003 effective tax rate includes a reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and tax benefits related to the sale and merger of foreign subsidiaries reflected in the International segment. The 2002 effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income, partially offset by the inability to utilize tax benefits on certain foreign capital losses. Income from discontinued operations declined $171 million, or 36%, to $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $471 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to 48 lower recognized net investment gains from real estate properties sold in 2003 as compared to the prior year. The income from discontinued operations is comprised of net investment income and net investment gains related to properties that the Company began marketing for sale on or after January 1, 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized $421 million and $582 million of net investment gains, respectively, from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale. The Company changed its method of accounting for embedded derivatives in certain insurance products as required by new accounting guidance which became effective on October 1, 2003, and recorded the impact as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 49 INSTITUTIONAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Institutional segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................... $ 9,093 $ 8,245 10% Universal life and investment type product policy fees...... 635 624 2% Net investment income....................................... 4,038 3,918 3% Other revenues.............................................. 592 609 (3)% Net investment gains (losses) (net of amounts allocable from other accounts of ($89) and $6, respectively).............

(26) Net income.................................................. $ 849 $ 759 12% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 INSTITUTIONAL The Companys Institutional segment offers a broad range of group insurance and retirement and savings products and services to corporations and other institutions. Group insurance products are offered as either an employer paid benefit, or as a voluntary benefit with premiums paid by the employee. Retirement and savings products and services include an array of annuity and investment products, as well as bundled administrative and investment services sold to sponsors of small and mid sized 401(k) and other defined contribution plans. Income from continuing operations increased by $207 million, or 32%, to $845 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $638 million for the comparable 2002 period. Revenue growth combined with favorable underwriting results and interest margins contributed to the year over year increase. Lower net investment losses in 2003 versus 2002 contributed $185 million after tax to the year over year increase. Favorable underwriting experience was partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations, as well as an increase in pension and postretirement benefit costs. In addition, the prior year period includes a $20 million after tax benefit from the release of a previously established liability for the Companys 2001 business realignment initiatives and a $17 million after tax benefit from the release of a previously established liability for disability insurance related losses from the September 11, 2001 tragedies. 50 Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, increased by $962 million, or 7%, to $14,358 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $13,396 million for the comparable 2002 period. The increase is attributable to both the group insurance and the retirement and savings product lines. Within group insurance, life insurance premiums and fees increased by $238 million, or 5%, which is in line with managements expectations. This increase is attributable primarily to higher sales and favorable persistency. The late 2003 acquisition of the John Hancock block of group life business contributed $72 million to this increase. In addition, the long term care, dental, and disability products experienced continued growth at a combined rate of approximately 14%, which is in line with managements expectations. Retirement and savings revenues increased approximately 12% primarily due to higher sales in the structured settlement products partially offset by the impact of a sale of a significant, single premium contract in the second quarter of 2002. Premiums and fees from retirement and saving products are significantly influenced by large transactions and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues primarily due to a decline in retirement and savings administrative fees from the Companys 401(k) business. This decline resulted from the exit from the large market 401(k) business in late 2001. Consequently, revenue decreased as business was transferred to other carriers throughout 2002. Total expenses increased by $912 million, or 8%, to $12,829 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $11,917 million for the comparable 2002 period. Policyholder related expenses increased $659 million primarily as a function of the growth in business. The increase in expenses is offset by favorable underwriting results in the term life insurance, dental, long term care, and retirement and savings products. The term life mortality incurred loss ratio, which represents actual life claims as a percentage of assumed claims incurred used in the determination of future policy benefits, was 92% for 2003 as compared to 93.6% in 2002. Underwriting results declined in disability as the morbidity incurred loss ratio, which represents actual disability claims as a percentage of assumed claims incurred used in the determination of future policy benefits, increased to 98.5% in 2003 from 97.9% in the prior year. The 2003 ratio was within managements expected range. In addition, the 2002 period includes a $28 million release of a previously established liability for disability insurance related losses from the September 11, 2001 tragedies. Other expenses increased by $253 million over the prior year period. Group insurance and retirement and savings expenses increased $115 million primarily due to an increase in non deferrable expenses associated with the aforementioned revenue growth, $77 million from an increase in pension and postretirement benefit expense, and a $33 million increase in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations. In addition, the prior year period includes a $30 million release of a previously established liability for the Companys 2001 business realignment initiatives. 51 INDIVIDUAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Individual segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $ 4,344 $ 4,507 (4)% Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 1,589 1,379 15% Net investment income................................... 6,201 6,244 (1)% Other revenues.......................................... 407 418 (3)% Net investment gains (losses) (net of amounts allocable from other accounts of ($177) and ($147), respectively).........................................

Products offered by Individual include insurance products, such as traditional, universal and variable life insurance and variable and fixed annuities. In addition, Individual sales representatives distribute disability insurance and long term care insurance products offered through the Institutional segment, investment products, such as mutual funds, as well as other products offered by the Companys other businesses. Income from continuing operations decreased by $56 million, or 9%, to $571 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $627 million for the comparable 2002 period. The decrease year over year is primarily driven by an increase in expenses of $144 million, or 1%, which is largely attributable to an increase in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations, pension and postretirement benefit costs, an increase in legal related costs and an adjustment related to certain improperly deferred expenses at New England Financial. Although revenues are essentially flat year over year, policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products grew 15% year over year. In addition, there is a slight increase in premiums related to other traditional life products. These increases are offset by a 5% decline in premiums from the Companys closed block business, which consists of participating policies issued prior to the 52 Companys demutualization. Premiums on the closed block represent approximately 80% of this segments premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, decreased by $7 million, or less than 1%, to $12,541 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $12,548 million for the comparable 2002 period. Policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products grew by 15% over the prior year period. This growth is primarily a result of an 18% increase in the average separate account balances, which is largely attributable to improvements in the U.S. financial markets. Additionally, this increase is associated with the aging of the in force policies, as well as an increase in the sales of the enterprise variable annuity product through non traditional distribution channels. Policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of average assets. The value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity market performance. This increase in policy fee income was almost entirely offset by declines in premiums and net investment income. Premiums associated with the Companys closed block of business declined by $186 million, or 5%, which is in line with managements expectations, as this business continues to run off. Partially offsetting this decline is a slight increase in the other traditional life products. The decline in net investment income is mainly due to the change in capital allocation methodology and lower investment yields year over year. Total expenses increased by $144 million, or 1%, to $11,556 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $11,412 million for the comparable 2002 period. Other expenses increased by $251 million over the prior year period primarily as a result of expenses associated with certain efficiency initiatives and events. The most significant items include an increase of $67 million from pension and postretirement benefit expense, a $48 million expense recorded in the second quarter of 2003 for an adjustment related to certain improperly deferred expenses at New England Financial, $42 million in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations, $42 million increase in legal related costs, and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives at New England Financial. Offsetting these expense increases are a decline in policyholder benefits consistent with the aforementioned decline in the closed block and a decrease in dividends due to the reduction of the dividend scale in the fourth quarter of 2002, reflecting the impact of the low U.S. interest rate environment on the asset portfolios supporting these policies. 53 AUTO & HOME The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Auto & Home segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................. $2,908 $2,828 3% Net investment income..................................... 158 177 (11)% Other revenues............................................ 32 26 23% Net investment gains (losses).............................

Auto & Home primarily sells auto and homeowners insurance. Net income increased by $25 million, or 19%, to $157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $132 million for the comparable 2002 period. The increase in earnings year over year is mainly due to premium growth, lower investment losses and a reduction in expenses, partially offset by adverse claims development. Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, increased by $67 million, or 2%, to $3,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $3,031 million for the comparable 2002 period. This variance is mainly due to increases in the average earned premium due to rate increases, partially offset by lower investment income primarily resulting from the change in capital allocation methodology. Total expenses increased by $84 million, or 3%, to $2,896 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,812 million for the comparable 2002 period. Adverse claims development related to prior accident years, resulting mostly from bodily injury and uninsured motorists claims, accounted for $46 million of the increase in policyholder benefits. Also contributing to this increase are higher catastrophe losses of $22 million. Partially offsetting these increases are improved non catastrophe homeowners claims frequencies, a reduction in the number of auto and homeowners policies in force, and underwriting and agency management actions. In addition, there was a $23 million reduction in expenses resulting from the completion of the St. Paul integration and a $35 million reduction in the cost associated with the New York assigned risk plan. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, which represents losses and total expenses including claims as a percentage of premiums, declined to 97.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus 97.4% for the comparable 2002 period. 54 INTERNATIONAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the International segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................. $1,678 $1,511 11% Universal life and investment type product policy fees.... 272 144 89% Net investment income..................................... 502 461 9% Other revenues............................................ 80 14 471% Net investment gains (losses) (net of amounts allocable from other accounts of $3 and $0, respectively)......... 4 (9) 144% Total revenues.......................................... 2,536 2,121 20% EXPENSES Policyholder benefits and claims (excludes amounts directly related to net investment gains (losses) of $3 and $0, respectively)................................... 1,454 1,388 5% Interest credited to policyholder account balances........ 143 79 81% Policyholder dividends.................................... 55 35 57% Other expenses............................................ 659 507 30% Total expenses.......................................... 2,311 2,009 15% Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes............................................ 225 112 101% Provision for income taxes................................ 17 28 (39)% Net income................................................ $ 208 $ 84 148% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 INTERNATIONAL International provides life insurance, accident and health insurance, annuities and savings and retirement products to both individuals and groups, and auto and homeowners coverage to individuals. The Company focuses on emerging markets in the Latin America and Asia/Pacific regions. Net income increased by $124 million, or 148%, to $208 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $84 million for the comparable 2002 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo accounted for $48 million of this increase. Also contributing to the increase in earnings during 2003 is a $62 million after tax benefit from the merger of the Mexican operations and a reduction in policyholder liabilities resulting from a change in reserve methodology, a $12 million tax benefit in Chile and an $8 million after tax benefit related to reinsurance treaties. These increases are partially offset by a $19 million after tax charge in Taiwan related to an increased loss recognition reserve due to low interest rates relative to product guarantees. Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, increased by $402 million, or 19%, to $2,532 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,130 million for the comparable 2002 period. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Hidalgo, which accounted for $469 million of the variance, partially offset by decreases in Canada of $106 million attributable to a non recurring sale of an annuity contract and $28 million relating to the restructuring of a pension contract from an investment type product to a long term annuity, both of which occurred in 2002. In addition, South Koreas, Chiles and Taiwans revenues increased by $102 million, $60 million and $36 million, respectively, primarily due to business growth. These increases are partially offset by a $161 million decrease in Mexico, excluding Hidalgo. Anticipated actions taken by the Mexican government adversely impacted the insurance and annuities market 55 and resulted in a decline in premiums in Mexicos group and individual life businesses. In addition, the cancellation of a large broker sponsored case at the end of 2002 and the weakening of the peso also contributed to the 2003 decline in Mexico. Total expenses increased by $302 million, or 15%, to $2,311 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,009 million for the comparable 2002 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo contributed $394 million to this increase. Partially offsetting this is a decrease of $106 million for the aforementioned non recurring sale of an annuity contract and a decrease of $28 million for the restructuring of a pension contract, both of which occurred in 2002. In addition, South Koreas, Chiles and Taiwans expenses increased by $95 million, $65 million and $64 million, respectively, commensurate with the revenue increases in each country. Additionally, Taiwans expenses include a $30 million pre tax charge due to an increased loss recognition reserve as a result of low interest rates relative to product guarantees. These increases are partially offset by a $251 million decrease in Mexico, other than Hidalgo, primarily as a result of the impact on expenses from the aforementioned revenue decline in Mexico and a reduction in policyholder liabilities related to a change in reserve methodology. REINSURANCE The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Reinsurance segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................. $2,668 $2,005 33% Net investment income..................................... 473 421 12% Other revenues............................................ 49 43 14% Net investment gains (losses)............................. 31 2 1,450% Total revenues....................................... 3,221 2,471 30% EXPENSES Policyholder benefits and claims.......................... 2,136 1,554 37% Interest credited to policyholder account balances........ 184 146 26% Policyholder dividends.................................... 21 22 (5)% Other expenses............................................ 740 622 19% Total expenses....................................... 3,081 2,344 31% Income before provision for income taxes.................. 140 127 10% Provision for income taxes................................ 48 43 12% Net income................................................ $ 92 $ 84 10% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 REINSURANCE MetLifes Reinsurance segment is comprised of the life reinsurance business of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated ("RGA"), a publicly traded company, and MetLifes ancillary life reinsurance business. RGA has operations in North America and has subsidiary companies, branch offices, or representative offices in Australia, Barbados, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Net income increased by $8 million, or 10%, to $92 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $84 million for the comparable 2002 period. The increase in earnings year over year is primarily attributable to new business growth, additional renewal premiums, as well as a large coinsurance agreement with Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America ("Allianz Life") under which RGA assumed 100% of Allianz Lifes U.S. traditional life reinsurance business. 56 Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, increased by $721 million, or 29%, to $3,190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,469 million for the comparable 2002 period. This increase is primarily due to new premiums from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business, particularly in the U.S. and United Kingdom reinsurance operations. In addition, there was a $252 million increase in revenues due to the transaction with Allianz Life in late 2003. Total expenses increased by $737 million, or 31%, to $3,081 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,344 million for the comparable 2002 period. This increase is consistent with the growth in revenues and is primarily attributable to policyholder benefits and claims and allowances paid on assumed reinsurance, particularly on certain higher commission business in the United Kingdom. The aforementioned transaction with Allianz Life contributed $242 million to this increase. ASSET MANAGEMENT The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset Management segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Net investment income....................................... $ 66 $ 59 12% Other revenues.............................................. 143 166 (14)% Net investment gains (losses)............................... 9 (4) 325% Total revenues......................................... 218 221 (1)% OTHER EXPENSES.............................................. 182 211 (14)% Income before provision for income taxes.................... 36 10 260% Provision for income taxes.................................. 14 4 250% Net income.................................................. $ 22 $ 6 267% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 ASSET MANAGEMENT Asset Management, through SSRM Holdings, Inc. ("State Street Research"), provides a broad variety of asset management products and services to MetLife, third party institutions and individuals. State Street Research offers investment management services in all major investment disciplines through multiple channels of distribution in both the retail and institutional marketplaces. Net income increased by $16 million, or 267%, to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6 million for the comparable 2002 period. The increase year over year is mainly due to expense reductions and an increase in net investment gains in 2003. These improvements were partially offset by lower revenues earned as a result of a reduction in average assets under management. Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, decreased by $16 million, or 7%, to $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $225 million for the comparable 2002 period. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in revenues earned on lower average assets under management, despite an increase in ending assets under management of 7% to $47.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $44.6 billion for the comparable 2002 period. In addition, performance fees of $10 million earned during 2003 on certain investment products, were lower than the $14 million earned during the comparable 2002 period. Other expenses decreased by $29 million, or 14%, to $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $211 million for the comparable 2002 period. Compensation related expenses declined $17 million primarily as a result of staff reductions undertaken in the third and fourth quarters of 2002. Additionally, 57 variable expenses declined $6 million largely as a result of lower average assets under management. General and administrative expenses declined $6 million due to lower spending. CORPORATE & OTHER YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 CORPORATE & OTHER Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not allocated to the business segments, as well as expenses associated with the resolution of proceedings alleging race conscious underwriting practices, sales practices and asbestos related claims, and interest expense related to the majority of the Companys outstanding debt. Income and loss from continuing operations increased by $485 million, or 111%, to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from a loss of $437 million for the comparable 2002 period. The 2003 period includes a $92 million after tax benefit from a reduction of a previously established liability related to the Companys race conscious underwriting settlement and a $36 million benefit from a revision of the estimate of income tax for 2002. The 2002 period includes a $169 million after tax charge to cover costs associated with asbestos related claims, a $48 million after tax charge to cover costs associated with the resolution of a federal government investigation of General American Life Insurance Companys ("General American") former Medicare business, and a $30 million after tax reduction of a previously established liability related to the Companys sales practice class action settlement in 1999. Excluding the impact of these items, the increase in earnings year over year is mainly due to higher investment income. Total revenues, excluding net investment gains and losses, increased by $201 million, or 1,117%, to $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $18 million for the comparable 2002 period. This variance is mainly due to higher investment income resulting from the change in capital allocation methodology, as well as increases in income from corporate joint ventures, equity linked notes and securities lending. Total expenses decreased by $421 million, or 58%, to $304 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $725 million for the comparable 2002 period. The 2003 period includes a $144 million reduction of a previously established liability related to the Companys race conscious underwriting settlement. The 2002 period includes a $266 million charge to increase the Companys asbestos related liability and expenses to cover costs associated with the resolution of federal government investigations of General Americans former Medicare business. 58 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 THE COMPANY The following table presents consolidated financial information for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $19,077 $17,212 11% Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 2,147 1,889 14% Net investment income................................... 11,261 11,187 1% Other revenues.......................................... 1,332 1,507 (12)% Net investment gains (losses) (net of amounts allocable to other accounts of ($145) and ($134), respectively).........................................

This variance is primarily attributable to increases in the Institutional, International and Reinsurance segments. A $957 million increase in Institutional is largely due to sales growth in its group life, dental, disability and long term care businesses, a sale of a significant retirement and savings contract in the second quarter of 2002, as well as new sales throughout 2002 in this segments structured settlements and traditional annuity products. The June 2002 acquisition of Hidalgo, the 2001 acquisitions in Chile and Brazil and the sale of an annuity contract in the first quarter of 2002 to a Canadian trust company are the primary drivers of a $665 million increase in International. A portion of the increase in International is also attributable to business growth in South Korea, Mexico (excluding Hidalgo) and Taiwan. In addition, an increase in Canada due to the restructuring of a pension contract from an investment type product to a long term annuity contributed to this variance. New premiums from facultative and automatic treaties, and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business contributed to a $243 million increase in the Reinsurance segment. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $258 million, or 14%, to $2,147 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,889 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is primarily attributable to the Individual, International and Institutional segments. A $119 million favorable variance in Individual is due to an increase in policy fees from insurance products, primarily due to higher revenue from insurance fees, which increase as the average separate account asset base supporting the underlying minimum death benefits declines. The average separate account asset base has declined in 2002 in 59 response to poor equity market performance. These increases are partially offset by lower policy fees from annuity and investment type products generally resulting from poor equity market performance despite growth in annuity deposits. A $106 million increase in International is largely due to the acquisition of Hidalgo and the acquisitions in Chile, partially offset by the cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A., ("Banco Santander") in 2001. A $32 million increase in Institutional is principally due to a fee related to the renegotiation of a portion of a bank owned life insurance contract, as well as growth in existing business in the group universal life product. Net investment income increased by $74 million, or 1%, to $11,261 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $11,187 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is primarily attributable to increases of (i) $58 million, or 1%, in income from fixed maturities, (ii) $62 million, or 15%, in income from real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment, net of investment expenses and depreciation, (iii) $35 million, or 2%, in income on mortgage loans on real estate, (iv) $7 million, or 1%, in interest income on policy loans, and (v) lower investment expenses of $9 million, or 4%. These variances are partially offset by decreases of (i) $47 million, or 17%, in income on cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, (ii) $39 million, or 17%, in income on other invested assets, and (iii) $11 million, or 10%, in income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests. The increase in income from fixed maturities to $8,076 million in 2002 from $8,018 million in 2001 is largely due to a higher asset base, primarily resulting from increased cash flows from sales of insurance and the acquisitions in Mexico and Chile. In addition, securities lending income was higher due to increased activity and a more favorable cost of funds. The increases in income from fixed maturities are partially offset by decreases resulting from lower reinvestment rates and a decline in bond prepayment fees. The increase in income from real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment to $477 million in 2002 from $415 million in 2001 is primarily due to the transfer of the Companys One Madison Avenue, New York property from a company use property to an investment property in 2002. The increase in income on mortgage loans on real estate to $1,883 million in 2002 from $1,848 million in 2001 is due primarily to a higher asset base from new loan production, partially offset by lower mortgage rates. The increase in interest income from policy loans to $543 million in 2002 from $536 million in 2001 is largely due to increased loans outstanding. The decrease in income from cash, cash equivalents and short term investments to $232 million in 2002 from $279 million in 2001 is due to declining interest rates coupled with a decrease in the asset base. The decrease in net investment income from other invested assets to $186 million in 2002 from $225 million in 2001 is largely due to lower derivative income, partially offset by an increase in reinsurance contracts funds withheld at interest. The decline in income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests to $99 million in 2002 from $110 million in 2001 primarily resulted from lower dividend income from equity securities, partially offset by higher limited corporate partnership distributions. The increase in net investment income is attributable to increases in the International, Individual and Reinsurance segments, partially offset by decreases in Corporate & Other, and the Institutional and Auto & Home segments. A $194 million increase in International is due to a higher asset base resulting from the acquisitions in Mexico and Chile. Individual increased by $79 million primarily due to higher income from securities lending and limited corporate partnership distributions, partially offset by lower bond prepayment fee income. The Reinsurance segment increased $31 million largely resulting from an increase in reinsurance contracts funds withheld at interest. The decrease in Corporate & Other of $146 million is due to a lower asset base, resulting from funding Internationals acquisitions in Mexico and Chile, as well as the Companys common stock repurchases, partially offset by higher income from securities lending. Institutional decreased $49 million predominantly as a result of decreased limited partnership, equity linked note and bond prepayment fee income. Auto & Home decreased $23 million primarily due to lower reinvestment rates. Other revenues decreased by $175 million, or 12%, to $1,332 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,507 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is primarily attributable to decreases in the Individual, Institutional, Asset Management segments and Corporate & Other. Individual decreased by $77 million resulting from lower commission and fee income associated with decreased volume in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries as a result of the depressed equity markets. A $40 million decrease in Institutional is primarily due to a $73 million reduction in administrative fees as a result of the Companys exit 60 from the large market 401(k) business in late 2001, as well as lower fees earned on investments in separate accounts resulting generally from poor equity market performance. This reduction is partially offset by a $33 million increase in group insurance due to growth in the administrative service businesses and a settlement received in 2002 related to the Companys former medical business. A $32 million decrease in Asset Management is primarily due to the sale of Conning in July 2001. In addition, Corporate & Other decreased by $29 million principally due to the remeasurement of the Companys reinsurance recoverable associated with the sales practices reinsurance treaty in 2001, as well as an increase in the elimination of intersegment activity. This was partially offset from a gain on the sale of a company occupied building, and income earned on corporate owned life insurance ("COLI") purchased during 2002. The Companys investment gains and losses are net of related policyholder amounts. The amounts netted against investment gains and losses are (i) amortization of DAC, to the extent that such amortization results from investment gains and losses, (ii) adjustments to participating contractholder accounts when amounts equal to such investment gains and losses are applied to the contractholders accounts, and (iii) adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. Net investment gains and losses increased by $172 million, or 30%, to $751 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $579 million for the comparable 2001 period. This increase reflects total investment gains (losses), before offsets, of $896 million (including gross gains of $1,836 million, gross losses of $1,091 million, writedowns of $1,501 million, and a net loss from derivatives of $140 million which includes scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting of $32 million), an increase of $183 million, or 26%, from $713 million in 2001. Offsets include the amortization of DAC of ($5) million and ($25) million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation of $157 million and $159 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and adjustments to participating contracts of ($7) million in 2002. Refer to " Investments" beginning on page 86 for a discussion of the Companys investment portfolio. The Company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its performance. Investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers. The Company believes its presentation enables readers to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its performance. The Companys presentation of investment gains and losses, net of policyholder amounts, may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies and, therefore, amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $1,069 million, or 6%, to $19,523 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $18,454 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is attributable to increases in the International, Institutional and Reinsurance segments, partially offset by a decrease in the Auto & Home segment. A $699 million increase in International is primarily due to the acquisition of Hidalgo, the acquisitions in Chile and Brazil, the aforementioned sale of an annuity contract, the restructuring of a Canadian pension contract and business growth in South Korea, Mexico (excluding Hidalgo) and Taiwan. An increase in Institutional of $415 million is commensurate with the growth in premiums as discussed above, largely offset by the establishment of a liability in 2001 related to the September 11, 2001 tragedies and the 2001 fourth quarter business realignment initiatives. An increase in Reinsurance of $70 million is commensurate with the growth in premiums discussed above. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $102 million in the Auto & Home segment. The variance in Auto & Home is largely due to improved claim frequency resulting from milder winter weather, lower catastrophe levels and fewer personal umbrella claims, partially offset by an increase in current year bodily injury and no fault severities and costs associated with the processing of the New York assigned risk business. Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by $134 million, or 4%, to $2,950 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $3,084 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is attributable to decreases in the Individual and Institutional segments, partially offset by increases in the International and Reinsurance segments. A $105 million decrease in Individual is primarily due to the 61 establishment in 2001 of a policyholder liability with respect to certain group annuity contracts at New England Financial. Excluding this policyholder liability, interest credited expense increased slightly in response to an increase in policyholder account balances, which is primarily attributable to sales growth despite declines in interest crediting rates. An $81 million decrease in Institutional is primarily due to a decline in average crediting rates resulting from the current interest rate environment. These variances are partially offset by a net increase of $28 million in International. This increase is principally due to the acquisition of Hidalgo, partially offset by a reduction in the number of investment type policies in force in Argentina. In addition, a $24 million increase in Reinsurance is primarily due to several new annuity reinsurance agreements executed during 2002. Policyholder dividends decreased by $144 million, or 7%, to $1,942 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $2,086 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is attributable to a decrease in the Institutional segment resulting from unfavorable mortality experience of several large group clients. Institutional policyholder dividends vary from period to period based on participating contract experience, which is recorded in policyholder benefits and claims. Other expenses decreased by $7 million, or less than 1%, to $7,015 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $7,022 million for the comparable 2001 period. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of DAC, which are discussed below, other expenses increased by $68 million, or 1%, to $7,716 million in 2002 from $7,648 million in 2001. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of DAC and the change in accounting as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, ("SFAS 142"), which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles, other expenses increased by $115 million. This variance is primarily attributable to increases in the Reinsurance and International segments, as well as in Corporate & Other, partially offset by decreases in the Institutional, Individual and Asset Management segments. A $209 million increase in Reinsurance is primarily attributable to increases in allowances paid, primarily driven by high allowance business in the United Kingdom along with strong growth in the U.S. and Asia/Pacific regions. An increase of $166 million in International expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of Hidalgo, the acquisitions in Chile and Brazil, as well as business growth in South Korea, Mexico (excluding Hidalgo), and Hong Kong. An increase in Corporate & Other of $65 million is primarily due to increases in legal and interest expenses. The 2002 period includes a $266 million charge to increase the Companys asbestos related liability, expenses to cover costs associated with the resolution of federal government investigations of General Americans former Medicare business and a reduction of a previously established liability related to the Companys sales practices class action settlement. The 2001 period includes a $250 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 to cover costs associated with the resolution of class action lawsuits and a regulatory inquiry pending against Metropolitan Life involving alleged race conscious insurance underwriting practices prior to 1973. The increase in interest expenses is primarily due to increases in long term debt resulting from the issuance of $1.25 billion and $1 billion of senior debt in November 2001 and December 2002, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper in 2002. In addition, a decrease in the elimination of intersegment activity contributed to the variance. A decrease of $181 million in Institutional is due to higher expenses resulting from the business realignment initiatives accrual in the fourth quarter 2001 (primarily the Companys exit from the large market 401(k) business), $30 million of which was released into income in the fourth quarter of 2002. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in 2002 operational expenses for dental and disability and group insurances non deferrable expenses commensurate with the aforementioned premium growth, as well as higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses. A decrease of $105 million in Individual is due to continued expense management initiatives, including reduced compensation related expenses, a decline in business realignment expenses that were incurred in 2001 and reductions in volume related commission expenses in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries. These declines are partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses and an increase in expenses stemming from sales growth in new annuity and investment type products. In addition, a decrease of $39 million in Asset Management is primarily due to the sale of Conning in July 2001. DAC is principally amortized in proportion to gross margins and profits, including investment gains or losses. The amortization is allocated to investment gains and losses to provide consolidated statement of 62 income information regarding the impact of investment gains and losses on the amount of the amortization, and other expenses to provide amounts related to gross margins and profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Capitalization of DAC increased by $301 million, or 15%, to $2,340 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $2,039 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is primarily due to increases in the Reinsurance, Individual, International and Institutional segments. A $125 million increase in Reinsurance is commensurate with the increase in allowances paid. A $111 million increase in Individual is due to higher sales of annuity and investment type products, resulting in higher commissions and other deferrable expenses. A $51 million increase in International is primarily due to the 2002 acquisition of Hidalgo and overall business growth in South Korea, partially offset by a decrease in Argentina due to the reduction in business caused by the overall economic environment. A $22 million increase in Institutional is primarily due to growth in sales commissions and fees for disability products sold by Institutional. Total amortization of DAC increased by $206 million, or 14%, to $1,644 million in 2002 from $1,438 million in 2001. Amortization of DAC of $1,639 million and $1,413 million are allocated to other expenses in 2002 and 2001, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each period is allocated to investment gains and losses. The increase in amortization allocated to other expenses is attributable to increases in the Individual, International and Reinsurance segments. An increase of $111 million in Individual is due to the impact of the depressed equity markets and changes in the estimates of future gross profits. In 2002, estimates of future dividend scales, future maintenance expenses, future rider margins, and future reinsurance recoveries were revised. In 2001, estimates of future fixed account interest spreads, future gross margins and profits related to separate accounts and future mortality margins were revised. An increase in International of $64 million is primarily due to loss recognition in Argentina as a result of the economic environment, primarily the devaluation of its currency. The remaining increase was due to new business in South Korea, Taiwan, and the June 2002 acquisition of Hidalgo. An increase in Reinsurance of $55 million is due to growth in the business, commensurate with the growth in premiums described above. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $502 million, or 31% of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, compared with $204 million, or 36%, for the comparable 2001 period. The 2002 effective tax rate differs from the federal corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income. The 2001 effective tax rate differs from the federal corporate tax rate of 35%, due to an increase in prior year income taxes on capital gains. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS 144"), income related to the Companys real estate which was identified as held for sale on or after January 1, 2002 is presented as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The income from discontinued operations is comprised of net investment income and net investment gains related to 47 properties that the Company began marketing for sale on or after January 1, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recognized $582 million of net investment gains from discontinued operations due primarily to the sale of 36 properties. 63 INSTITUTIONAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Institutional segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $ 8,245 $ 7,288 13% Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 624 592 5% Net investment income................................... 3,918 3,967 (1)% Other revenues.......................................... 609 649 (6)% Net investment gains (losses) (net of amounts allocable from other accounts of $6 and ($105), respectively)...

Group insurance premiums increased by $496 million as a result of growth in this segments group life, dental, disability and long term care businesses. Retirement and savings premiums increased by $461 million primarily due to the sale of a significant contract in the second quarter of 2002, as well as new sales throughout 2002 from structured settlements and traditional annuity products. Retirement and savings premium levels are significantly influenced by large transactions and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $32 million, or 5%, to $624 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $592 million for the comparable 2001 period. This increase is primarily attributable to a fee resulting from the renegotiation of a portion of a bank owned life insurance contract, as well as growth in existing business in the group universal life product line. Other revenues decreased by $40 million, or 6%, to $609 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $649 million for the comparable 2001 period. Retirement and savings other revenues decreased $73 million primarily due to a reduction in administrative fees as a result of the Companys exit from the large market 401(k) business in late 2001, and lower fees earned on investments in separate accounts resulting generally from poor equity market performance. This decrease is partially offset by a $33 million increase in 64 group insurance due to growth in the administrative service businesses and a settlement received in 2002 related to the Companys former medical business. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $415 million, or 5%, to $9,339 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $8,924 million for the comparable 2001 period. This variance is attributable to increases of $238 million and $177 million in group insurance and retirement and savings, respectively. Excluding $291 million of 2001 claims related to the September 11, 2001 tragedies, group insurance policyholder benefits and claims increased by $529 million commensurate with the aforementioned premium growth in this segments group life, dental, disability, and long term care businesses. Excluding $215 million of 2001 policyholder benefits related to the fourth quarter 2001 business realignment initiatives, retirement and savings policyholder benefits increased $392 million, commensurate with the aforementioned premium growth. Interest credited to policyholders decreased by $81 million, or 8%, to $932 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,013 million for the comparable 2001 period. Decreases of $42 million and $39 million in retirement and savings and group insurance, respectively, are primarily attributable to declines in the average crediting rates in 2002 as a result of the current low interest rate environment. Policyholder dividends decreased by $144 million, or 56%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $259 million for the comparable 2001 period. This decline is largely attributable to unfavorable mortality experience of several large group clients. Policyholder dividends vary from period to period based on participating contract experience, which are generally recorded in policyholder benefits and claims. Other expenses decreased by $215 million, or 12%, to $1,531 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,746 million in the comparable 2001 period. Retirement and savings decreased by $293 million, primarily attributable to $184 million of accrued expenses related to business realignment initiatives recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 (predominantly related to the Companys exit from the large market 401(k) business), $30 million of which was released into income in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, ongoing expenses for the defined contribution product have steadily decreased throughout 2002. The net reduction in retirement and savings is partially offset by an increase in pension and postretirement costs. Group insurance other expenses increased by $78 million. This increase is mainly attributable to growth in operational expenses for the dental and disability products, as well as group insurances non deferrable expenses, including a certain portion of premium taxes and commissions. These variances are commensurate with the aforementioned premium growth. In addition, an increase in pension and postretirement costs contributed to the variance. 65 INDIVIDUAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Individual segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums................................................ $ 4,507 $ 4,563 (1)% Universal life and investment type product policy fees.................................................. 1,379 1,260 9% Net investment income................................... 6,244 6,165 1% Other revenues.......................................... 418 495 (16)% Net investment gains (losses) (net of amounts allocable from other accounts of ($147) and ($134), respectively).........................................

Premiums from insurance products decreased by $94 million, primarily resulting from a third quarter 2002 amendment of a reinsurance agreement to increase the amount of insurance ceded from 50% to 100%. This amendment was effective January 1, 2002. The Company also believes the decline is the result of a continued shift in policyholders preference from traditional policies to annuity and investment type products. These decreases are partially offset by policyholders expanding their traditional life insurance coverage through the purchase of additional insurance with dividend proceeds in 2002. Premiums from annuity products increased by $38 million as a result of higher sales of fixed annuities and supplementary contracts with life contingencies. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $119 million, or 9%, to $1,379 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,260 million for the comparable 2001 period. Policy fees from insurance products increased by $144 million primarily due to higher revenue from insurance fees, which increase as the average separate account asset base supporting the underlying minimum death benefit declines. The average separate account asset base has declined in response to poor equity market performance. Additionally, this variance reflects the acceleration of the recognition of unearned fees associated with future reinsurance recoveries. Policy fees from annuity and investment type products decreased by $25 million 66 primarily due to declines in the average separate account asset base resulting generally from poor equity market performance, partially offset by an increase in fees resulting from growth in annuity deposits. Policy fees from annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of average separate account assets. Such assets can fluctuate depending on equity market performance. Other revenues decreased by $77 million, or 16%, to $418 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $495 million for the comparable 2001 period, largely due to lower commission and fee income associated with a volume decline in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries which is principally due to the depressed equity markets. The Companys investment gains and losses are net of related policyholder amounts. The amounts netted against investment gains and losses are (i) amortization of DAC, to the extent that such amortization results from investment gains and losses, (ii) adjustments to participating contractholder accounts when amounts equal to such investment gains and losses are applied to the contractholders accounts, and (iii) adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. The Company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its performance. Investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers. The Company believes its presentation enables readers to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its performance. The Companys presentation of investment gains and losses, net of policyholder amounts, may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies and, therefore, amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers. Policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $13 million, or less than 1%, to $5,220 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $5,233 million for the comparable 2001 period. Policyholder benefits and claims for insurance products decreased by $119 million, primarily due to the impact of the aforementioned reinsurance transaction and the establishment of liabilities for the September 11, 2001 tragedies in the previous year. Policyholder benefits and claims for annuity and investment type products increased by $106 million primarily due to an increase in fixed and immediate annuity liabilities, resulting from business growth and an increase in the liability associated with guaranteed minimum death benefits on variable annuities. Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by $105 million, or 6%, to $1,793 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $1,898 for the comparable 2001 period. This decrease was primarily due to the establishment of a $118 million policyholder liability with respect to certain group annuity contracts at New England Financial in 2001. Excluding this policyholder liability, interest credited increased slightly due to an increase in policyholder account balances which is primarily attributable to sales growth partially offset by declines in interest crediting rates. Policyholder dividends increased by $3 million, or less than 1%, to $1,770 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,767 million for the comparable 2001 period due to the increase in the invested assets supporting the policies associated with this segments large block of traditional life insurance business. This increase is partially offset by the approval by the Companys Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a reduction in the dividend scale to reflect the impact of the current low interest rate environment on the asset portfolios supporting these policies. Other expenses decreased by $118 million, or 4%, to $2,629 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 million from $2,747 for the comparable 2001 period. Excluding the capitalization and amortization of DAC, which are discussed below, other expenses decreased by $118 million, or 4%, to $2,922 million in 2002 from $3,040 million in 2001. Other expenses related to insurance products decreased by $129 million, which is attributable to continued expense management, reductions in volume related commission expenses in the broker/dealer and other subsidiaries and a reduction of $62 million related to business realignment expenses incurred in 2001. These decreases are partially offset by increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses over the comparable period. Other expenses related to annuity and investment type products increased by 67 $11 million. This increase is commensurate with the rise in sales of new annuity and investment type products, as well as increased pension and postretirement benefit expenses. This increase is partially offset by the reduction of $37 million of business realignment expenses incurred in 2001. DAC is principally amortized in proportion to gross margins or gross profits, including investment gains or losses. The amortization is allocated to investment gains and losses to provide consolidated statement of income information regarding the impact of investment gains and losses on the amount of the amortization, and other expenses to provide amounts related to gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Capitalization of DAC increased by $111 million, or 12%, to $1,037 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $926 million for the comparable 2001 period due to higher sales of annuity and investment type products, resulting in higher commissions and other deferrable expenses. Total amortization of DAC increased by $100 million, or 15%, to $754 million in 2002 from $654 million in 2001. Amortization of DAC of $744 million and $633 million is allocated to other expenses in 2002 and 2001, respectively, while the remainder of the amortization in each year is allocated to investment gains and losses. Increases in amortization of DAC allocated to other expenses of $84 million and $27 million related to insurance products and annuity and investment type products, respectively, are due to the impact of the depressed equity markets and changes in the estimates of future gross profits. In 2002, estimates of future dividend scales, future maintenance expenses, future rider margins, and future reinsurance recoveries were revised. In 2001, estimates of future fixed account interest spreads, future gross margins and profits related to separate accounts and future mortality margins were revised. AUTO & HOME The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Auto & Home segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................. $2,828 $2,755 3% Net investment income..................................... 177 200 (12)% Other revenues............................................ 26 22 18% Net investment gains (losses).............................

Auto and property premiums increased by $66 million and $1 million, respectively, primarily due to increases in average premium earned per policy resulting from rate increases. The impact on premiums from rate increases was partially offset by an expected reduction in retention and a reduction in new business sales. Premiums from other personal lines increased by $6 million. 68 Other revenues increased by $4 million, or 18%, to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $22 million for the comparable 2001 period. This increase was primarily due to income earned on a COLI policy purchased in the second quarter of 2002, as well as higher fees on installment payments. These increases were partially offset by an adjustment to a deferred gain related to the disposition of this segments reinsurance business in 1990. Policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $102 million, or 5%, to $2,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $2,121 million for the comparable 2001 period. Property policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $120 million due to improved claim frequency, underwriting and agency management actions, and a $41 million reduction in catastrophe losses. Property catastrophes represented 7.4% of the property loss ratio in 2002 compared to 13.5% in 2001. Other policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $10 million due to fewer personal umbrella claims. Fluctuations in these policyholder benefits and claims may not be commensurate with the change in premiums for a given period due to low premium volume and high liability limits. Auto policyholder benefits and claims increased by $28 million largely due to an increase in current year bodily injury and no fault severities. Costs associated with the processing of the New York assigned risk business also contributed to this increase. These increases were partially offset by improved claim frequency resulting from milder winter weather, underwriting and agency management actions, as well as lower catastrophe losses. Other expenses decreased by $7 million, or 1%, to $793 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $800 million for the comparable 2001 period. This decrease is primarily due to reduced employee head count and reduced expenses associated with the consolidation of The St. Paul business acquired in 1999. These declines are partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the outsourced New York assigned risk business. The effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 differ from the federal corporate tax rate of 35% due to the impact of non taxable investment income. 69 INTERNATIONAL The following table presents consolidated financial information for the International segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................. $1,511 $ 846 79% Universal life and investment type product policy fees.... 144 38 279% Net investment income..................................... 461 267 73% Other revenues............................................ 14 16 (13)% Net investment gains (losses).............................

The June 2002 acquisition of Hidalgo and the 2001 acquisitions in Chile and Brazil increased premiums by $228 million, $102 million and $8 million, respectively. In addition, a portion of the increase in premiums is attributable to a $108 million increase due to the sale of an annuity contract in the first quarter of 2002 to a Canadian trust company. South Koreas premiums increased by $91 million primarily due to a larger professional sales force and improved agent productivity. Mexicos premiums (excluding Hidalgo), increased by $66 million, primarily due to increases in its group life, major medical and individual life businesses. Excluding the aforementioned sale of an annuity contract, Canadas premiums increased by $26 million due to the restructuring of a pension contract from an investment type product to a long term annuity. Taiwans premiums increased by $13 million due primarily to continued growth in the individual life insurance business. Hong Kongs premiums increased $5 million primarily due to continued growth in the group life and traditional life businesses. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in Argentinas premiums of $9 million due to the reduction in business caused by the Argentine economic environment. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in other countries. Universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by $106 million, or 279%, to $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $38 million for the comparable 2001 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo and the acquisitions in Chile resulted in increases of $102 million and $5 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a $9 million decrease in Spain due to a reduction in fees caused by a decline in assets under management, as a result of the cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with Banco Santander in 2001. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. 70 Other revenues decreased by $2 million, or 13%, to $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $16 million for the comparable 2001 period. Canadas other revenues in 2001 included $1 million due primarily to the settlement of two legal cases in 2001. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. The acquisition of Hidalgo and the acquisitions in Chile and Brazil had no material impact on this variance. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $699 million, or 101%, to $1,388 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $689 million for the comparable 2001 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo and the acquisitions in Chile increased policyholder benefits and claims by $224 million and $169 million, respectively. In addition, $108 million of this increase in policyholder benefits and claims is attributable to the aforementioned sale of an annuity contract in Canada. South Koreas, Mexicos (excluding Hidalgo), Taiwans and Spains policyholder benefits and claims increased by $69 million, $67 million, $18 million and $15 million, respectively, commensurate with the overall premium increases discussed above. Excluding the aforementioned sale of an annuity contract, Canadas policyholder benefits and claims increased by $32 million primarily due to the restructuring of a pension contract from an investment type product to a long term annuity. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $28 million, or 55%, to $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $51 million for the comparable 2001 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo contributed $51 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $17 million in Argentina. This decrease is primarily due to modifications to policy contracts as authorized by the Argentinean government and a reduction of investment type policies in force. In addition, Spains interest credited decreased by $7 million primarily due to a decrease in the assets under management for life products with guarantees associated with the sale of a block of policies to Banco Santander in May 2001. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. Policyholder dividends remained essentially unchanged at $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $36 million for the comparable 2001 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo and the acquisitions in Chile and Brazil had no material impact on this variance. Other expenses increased by $178 million, or 54%, to $507 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $329 million for the comparable 2001 period. The acquisition of Hidalgo and the acquisitions in Chile and Brazil contributed $82 million, $21 million and $5 million, respectively. South Koreas, Mexicos (excluding Hidalgo), and Hong Kongs other expenses increased by $29 million, $19 million and $7 million, respectively. These increases are primarily due to increased non deferrable commissions from higher sales as discussed above, particularly in South Korea where fixed sales compensation is paid to new sales management as part of the professional agency expansion. Argentinas other expenses increased by $9 million due to additional loss recognition in connection with ongoing economic circumstances in the country. Polands other expenses increased by $5 million primarily due to costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the closing of this operation. The remainder of the variance is attributable to minor fluctuations in several countries. 71 REINSURANCE The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Reinsurance segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Premiums.................................................. $2,005 $1,762 14% Net investment income..................................... 421 390 8% Other revenues............................................ 43 42 2% Net investment gains (losses)............................. 2 (6) 133% Total revenues....................................... 2,471 2,188 13% EXPENSES Policyholder benefits and claims.......................... 1,554 1,484 5% Interest credited to policyholder account balances........ 146 122 20% Policyholder dividends.................................... 22 24 (8)% Other expenses............................................ 622 491 27% Total expenses....................................... 2,344 2,121 11% Income before provision for income taxes.................. 127 67 90% Provision for income taxes................................ 43 27 59% Net income................................................ $ 84 $ 40 110% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 REINSURANCE Premiums increased by $243 million, or 14%, to $2,005 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,762 million for the comparable 2001 period. New premiums from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business, particularly in the U.S. and United Kingdom reinsurance operations, all contributed to the premium growth. Premium levels are significantly influenced by large transactions and reporting practices of ceding companies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Other revenues remained essentially unchanged at $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $42 million for the comparable 2001 period. Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $70 million, or 5%, to $1,554 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1,484 million for the comparable 2001 period. Policyholder benefits and claims were 78% of premiums for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 84% in the comparable 2001 period. The decrease in policyholder benefits and claims as a percentage of premiums is primarily attributable to higher than expected mortality in the U.S. reinsurance operations during the first and fourth quarters of 2001, favorable claims experience in 2002 and the 2001 impact of claims associated with the September 11, 2001 tragedies. In addition, increases in the liabilities for future policyholder benefits and adverse results on the reinsurance of Argentine pension business during 2001 contributed to the decrease. The level of claims may fluctuate from period to period, but exhibits less volatility over the long term. Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by $24 million, or 20%, to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $122 million for the comparable 2001 period. Contributing to this growth were several new annuity reinsurance agreements executed during 2002. The crediting rate on certain blocks of annuities is based on the performance of the underlying assets. Policyholder dividends were essentially unchanged at $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, versus $24 million for the 2001 comparable period. 72 Other expenses increased by $131 million, or 27%, to $622 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $491 million for the comparable 2001 period. The increase in other expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in reinsurance business in the United Kingdom, which is characterized by higher initial reinsurance allowances than those historically experienced in the segment. These expenses fluctuate depending on the mix of the underlying insurance products being reinsured as allowances paid and the related capitalization and amortization can vary significantly based on the type of business and the reinsurance treaty. ASSET MANAGEMENT The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset Management segment for the years indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 % CHANGE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) REVENUES Net investment income....................................... $ 59 $ 71 (17)% Other revenues.............................................. 166 198 (16)% Net investment gains (losses)...............................

The most significant factor contributing to this decline is a $31 million decrease resulting from the sale of Conning, which occurred in July 2001. Excluding the impact of this transaction, other revenues remained essentially unchanged at $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Despite lower average assets under management, revenues remained constant due to performance and incentive fees earned on certain real estate and hedge fund products. The lower assets under management are primarily due to institutional client withdrawals, and the downturn in the equity market. In addition, fourth quarter 2002 product closings and business exits also contributed to this decline. Other expenses decreased by $41 million, or 16%, to $211 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $252 million for the comparable 2001 period. Excluding the impact of the sale of Conning, other expenses decreased by $6 million, or 3%, to $211 million in 2002 from $217 million in 2001. This decrease is due to reductions in marketing related expenses and expenses related to fund reimbursements. In addition, a decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions resulted from a reduction in sales. These decreases were partially offset by a $5 million increase in employee compensation attributable to severance related expenses resulting from third and fourth quarter 2002 staff reductions. CORPORATE & OTHER YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 CORPORATE & OTHER Other revenues decreased by $29 million, or 34%, to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $85 million for the comparable 2001 period. This is primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the Companys reinsurance recoverable associated with the sales practices reinsurance treaty in 2001, as well as 73 an increase in the elimination of intersegment activity. This is partially offset from a gain on the sale of a company occupied building, and income earned on COLI purchased during 2002. Other expenses increased by $65 million, or 10%, to $722 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $657 million for the comparable 2001 period, primarily due to increases in legal and interest expenses. The 2002 period includes a $266 million charge to increase the Companys asbestos related liability, expenses to cover costs associated with the resolution of federal government investigations of General Americans former Medicare business and a reduction of a previously established liability related to the Companys sales practices class action settlement. The 2001 period includes a $250 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 to cover costs associated with the resolution of class action lawsuits and a regulatory inquiry pending against Metropolitan Life, involving alleged race conscious insurance underwriting practices prior to 1973. The increase in interest expenses is primarily due to increases in long term debt resulting from the issuance of $1.25 billion and $1 billion of senior debt in November 2001 and December 2002, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper in 2002. In addition, a decrease in the elimination of intersegment activity contributed to the variance. BUSINESS REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company implemented several business realignment initiatives, which resulted from a strategic review of operations and an ongoing commitment to reduce expenses. The impact of these actions on a segment basis were charges of $399 million in Institutional, $97 million in Individual and $3 million in Auto & Home. The liability at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $27 million and $40 million, in the Institutional segment and $9 million and $18 million, in the Individual segment, respectively. The remaining liability is due to certain contractual obligations. SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TRAGEDIES On September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania (the "tragedies") triggering a significant loss of life and property, which had an adverse impact on certain of the Companys businesses. The Companys original estimate of the total insurance losses related to the tragedies, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2001, was $208 million, net of income taxes of $117 million. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys remaining liability for unpaid and future claims associated with the tragedies was $9 million and $47 million, respectively, principally related to disability coverages. This estimate has been and will continue to be subject to revision in subsequent periods, as claims are received from insureds and processed. Any revision to the estimate of losses in subsequent periods will affect net income in such periods. METLIFE CAPITAL TRUST I In connection with MetLife, Inc.s, initial public offering in April 2000, the Holding Company and MetLife Capital Trust I (the "Trust") issued equity security units (the "units"). Each unit originally consisted of (i) a contract to purchase, for $50, shares of the Holding Companys common stock (the "purchase contracts") on May 15, 2003; and (ii) a capital security of the Trust, with a stated liquidation amount of $50. In accordance with the terms of the units, the Trust was dissolved on February 5, 2003, and $1,006 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% debentures of the Holding Company (the "MetLife debentures"), the sole assets of the Trust, were distributed to the owners of the Trusts capital securities in exchange for their capital securities. The MetLife debentures were remarketed on behalf of the debenture owners on February 12, 2003 and the interest rate on the MetLife debentures was reset as of February 15, 2003 to 3.911% per annum for a yield to maturity of 2.876%. As a result of the remarketing, the debenture owners received $21 million ($0.03 per diluted common share) in excess of the carrying value of the capital securities. This excess was recorded by the Company as a charge to additional paid in capital and, for the purpose of calculating earnings per share, is subtracted from net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders. 74 On May 15, 2003, the purchase contracts associated with the units were settled. In exchange for $1,006 million, the Company issued 2.97 shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock per purchase contract, or approximately 59.8 million shares of treasury stock. The excess of the Companys cost of the treasury stock ($1,662 million) over the contract price of the stock issued to the purchase contract holders ($1,006 million) was $656 million, which was recorded as a direct reduction to retained earnings. Interest expense on the capital securities is included in other expenses and was $10 million, $81 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE HOLDING COMPANY Capital Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and Financial Holding Companies Capital. MetLife, Inc. and its insured depository institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank, N.A. ("MetLife Bank"), a national bank, are subject to risk based and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding companies. The federal banking regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. At December 31, 2003, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank were in compliance with the aforementioned guidelines. The following table contains the RBC ratios as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the regulatory requirements for MetLife Inc., as a bank holding company, and MetLife Bank: METLIFE, INC.

It is managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and is provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short and long term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through committed credit facilities. The Holding Company is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost effective sources of funds, are critical components of the Holding Companys liquidity management. Decisions to access these 75 markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth, and a targeted liquidity profile. A disruption in the financial markets could limit the Holding Companys access to liquidity. The Holding Companys ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Management views its capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and its liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining high credit ratings. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and term debt transactions, and exposure to contingent draws on the Holding Companys liquidity. Liquidity Sources Dividends. The primary source of the Holding Companys liquidity is dividends it receives from Metropolitan Life. Under the New York Insurance Law, Metropolitan Life is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a cash dividend to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of its statutory surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year; and (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). Metropolitan Life will be permitted to pay a cash dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the New York Superintendent of Insurance (the "Superintendent") and the Superintendent does not disapprove the distribution. Under the New York Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders. The New York Insurance Department (the "Department") has established informal guidelines for such determinations. The guidelines, among other things, focus on the insurers overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices. Management of the Holding Company cannot provide assurance that Metropolitan Life will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the Holding Company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the Superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that Metropolitan Life must submit for the Superintendents consideration. In addition, the Holding Company receives dividends from its other subsidiaries. The Holding Companys other insurance subsidiaries are also subject to similar restrictions on the payment of dividends to their respective parent companies. The dividend limitation is based on statutory financial results. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which the Company conducts business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income taxes, required investment reserves, reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum amount of the dividend which may be paid to the Holding Company by Metropolitan Life, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity Company in 2004, without prior regulatory approval, is $798 million, $200 million and $185 million, respectively. Liquid Assets. An integral part of the Holding Companys liquidity management is the amount of liquid assets that it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable fixed maturity and equity securities. Liquid assets exclude assets relating to securities lending and dollar roll activities. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Holding Company had $1,320 million and $846 million in liquid assets, respectively. Global Funding Sources. Liquidity is also provided by a variety of both short and long term instruments, including repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium and long term debt, capital securities 76 and stockholders equity. The diversification of the Holding Companys funding sources enhances funding flexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds, and generally lowers the cost of funds. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Holding Company had $106 million and $249 million of short term debt outstanding, and $3.96 billion and $3.27 billion in long term debt outstanding, respectively. The Holding Company filed a $5.0 billion shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), which became effective on March 4, 2004. The shelf registration will permit the registration and issuance of a wide range of debt and equity securities, including preferred securities of a subsidiary trust guaranteed by MetLife Inc., as described more fully therein. Approximately $44 million of registered but unissued securities remaining from the Companys 2001 $4.0 billion shelf registration statement has been carried over to this shelf registration. The Holding Company issued and remarketed senior debt and debentures in the amount of $3.96 billion under the 2001 $4.0 billion shelf registration statement. The following table summarizes the Holding Companys senior debt issuances: INTEREST ISSUE DATE PRINCIPAL RATE MATURITY (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) November 2003..................................... $500 5.00% 2013 November 2003..................................... $200 5.88% 2033 December 2002..................................... $400 5.38% 2012 December 2002..................................... $600 6.50% 2032 November 2001..................................... $500 5.25% 2006 November 2001..................................... $750 6.13% 2011 In addition, in February 2003, the Holding Company remarketed $1,006 million aggregate principal amount of debentures previously issued in connection with the issuance of equity security units. See " MetLife Capital Trust I ." Other sources of the Holding Companys liquidity include programs for short and long term borrowing, as needed, arranged through Metropolitan Life. Credit Facilities. The Holding Company maintains a committed and unsecured credit facility, which expires in 2005, for approximately $1.25 billion which it shares with Metropolitan Life and MetLife Funding, Inc. ("MetLife Funding"). In April 2003, Metropolitan Life and MetLife Funding replaced an expiring $1 billion five year credit facility with a $1 billion 364 day credit facility and the Holding Company was added as a borrower. Drawdowns under these facilities bear interest at varying rates stated in the agreements. These facilities are primarily used for general corporate purposes and as back up lines of credit for the borrowers commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2003, neither the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life nor MetLife Funding had drawn against these credit facilities. Liquidity Uses The primary uses of liquidity of the Holding Company include cash dividends on common stock, service on debt, capital contributions to subsidiaries, payment of general operating expenses and the repurchase of the Holding Companys common stock. Dividends. On October 21, 2003, the Holding Companys Board of Directors approved an annual dividend for 2003 of $0.23 per share. The dividend was paid on December 15, 2003 to shareholders of record on November 7, 2003. The 2003 dividend represents an increase of $0.02 per share from the 2002 annual dividend of $0.21 per share. Future dividend decisions will be determined by the Holding Companys Board of Directors after taking into consideration factors such as the Holding Companys current earnings, expected medium and long term earnings, financial condition, regulatory capital position, and applicable governmental regulations and policies. 77 Capital Contributions to Subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Holding Company contributed an aggregate of $239 million and $500 million to various subsidiaries, respectively. Share Repurchase. On February 19, 2002, the Holding Companys Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion common stock repurchase program. This program began after the completion of the March 28, 2001 and June 27, 2000 repurchase programs, each of which authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of common stock. Under these authorizations, the Holding Company may purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. The following table summarizes the 2003, 2002 and 2001 repurchase activity: DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Shares Repurchased............................. 2,997,200 15,244,492 45,242,966 Cost........................................... $ 97 $ 471 $ 1,321 At December 31, 2003, the Holding Company had approximately $709 million remaining on its existing share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of 2003, RGA offered to the public 12,075,000 shares of its common stock at $36.65 per share. MetLife and its affiliates purchased 3,000,000 shares of the common stock being offered by RGA. As a result of this offering, MetLifes ownership percentage of outstanding shares of RGA common stock was reduced from approximately 59% at December 31, 2002 to approximately 52% at December 31, 2003. Support Agreements. In 2002, the Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance agreement with three of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance Company, First MetLife Investors Insurance Company and MetLife Investors Insurance Company of California. Under the agreements, the Holding Company agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of $10 million (or, with respect to MetLife Investors Insurance Company of California, $5 million), total adjusted capital at a level not less than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current obligations on a timely basis. At December 31, 2003, the capital and surplus of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of the minimum capital and surplus amounts referenced above, and their total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent referenced RBC based amount calculated at December 31, 2003. Based on managements analysis and comparison of its current and future cash inflows from the dividends it receives from subsidiaries, including Metropolitan Life, that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows, management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the Holding Company to make payments on debt, make cash dividend payments on its common stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay all operating expenses and meet its other obligations. THE COMPANY Capital RBC. Section 1322 of the New York Insurance Law requires that New York domestic life insurers report their RBC based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and statutory reserve items; similar rules apply to each of the Companys domestic insurance subsidiaries. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. Section 1322 gives the Superintendent explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by, or to take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain RBC levels. At December 31, 2003, Metropolitan Lifes and each of the Holding Companys domestic insurance subsidiaries total adjusted capital was in excess of each of the RBC levels required by each state of domicile. 78 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") adopted Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles ("Codification"), which is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments and became effective January 1, 2001. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. The Department required adoption of Codification with certain modifications for the preparation of statutory financial statements of insurance companies domiciled in New York effective January 1, 2001. Effective December 31, 2002, the Department adopted a modification to its regulations to be consistent with Codification with respect to the admissibility of deferred income taxes by New York insurers, subject to certain limitations. The adoption of Codification, as modified by the Department, did not adversely affect Metropolitan Lifes statutory capital and surplus. Further modifications by state insurance departments may impact the effect of Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of Metropolitan Life and the Holding Companys other insurance subsidiaries. Liquidity Sources Cash Flow from Operations. The Companys principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. The Company seeks to include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products, including general account institutional pension products (generally group annuities, including guaranteed interest contracts and certain deposit fund liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. The Companys principal cash inflows from its investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash inflows are the risk of default by debtors and market volatilities. The Company closely monitors and manages these risks through its credit risk management process. Liquid Assets. An integral part of the Companys liquidity management is the amount of liquid assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable fixed maturity and equity securities. Liquid assets exclude assets relating to securities lending and dollar roll activities. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had $125 billion and $108 billion in liquid assets, respectively. Global Funding Sources. Liquidity is also provided by a variety of both short and long term instruments, including repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium and long term debt, capital securities and stockholders equity. The diversification of the Companys funding sources enhances funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had $3,642 million and $1,161 million in short term debt outstanding, and $5,703 million and $4,425 million in long term debt outstanding, respectively. On November 1, 2003, the Company redeemed the $300 million of 7.45% Surplus Notes outstanding scheduled to mature on November 1, 2023 at a redemption price of $311 million. See " The Holding Company Global Funding Sources." MetLife Funding serves as a centralized finance unit for Metropolitan Life. Pursuant to a support agreement, Metropolitan Life has agreed to cause MetLife Funding to have a tangible net worth of at least one dollar. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, MetLife Funding had a tangible net worth of $10.8 million and $10.7 million, respectively. MetLife Funding raises funds from various funding sources and uses the proceeds to extend loans, through MetLife Credit Corp., a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life, to the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life and other affiliates. MetLife Funding manages its funding sources to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of Metropolitan Life and other affiliated companies. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, MetLife Funding had total outstanding liabilities, including accrued interest payable, of $1,042 million and $400 million, respectively, consisting primarily of commercial paper. Credit Facilities. The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating $2.5 billion ($1 billion expiring in 2004, $1.3 billion expiring in 2005 and $175 million expiring in 2006). If these facilities were drawn upon, they would bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective 79 agreements. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also as back up lines of credit for the Companys commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2003, the Company had drawn approximately $49 million under the facilities expiring in 2005 at interest rates ranging from 4.08% to 5.48% and approximately $50 million under a facility expiring in 2006 at an interest rate of 1.69%. In April 2003, the Company replaced an expiring $1 billion five year credit facility with a $1 billion 364 day credit facility. In May 2003, the Company replaced an expiring $140 million three year credit facility with a $175 million three year credit facility, which expires in 2006. Liquidity Uses Insurance Liabilities. The Companys principal cash outflows primarily relate to the liabilities associated with its various life insurance, property and casualty, annuity and group pension products, operating expenses and income taxes, as well as principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations. Liabilities arising from its insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under the aforementioned products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. Investment and Other. Additional cash outflows include those related to obligations of securities lending and dollar roll activities, investments in real estate, limited partnerships and joint ventures, as well as litigation related liabilities. The following table summarizes the Companys major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 THEREAFTER (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Other long term liabilities(1)............... $87,086 $4,391 $3,812 $3,475 $3,763 $2,934 $68,711 Long term debt(2).............. 5,646 126 1,413 653 28 32 3,394 Partnership investments(3)..... 1,380 1,380 Operating leases............... 1,545 210 192 168 145 113 717 Mortgage commitments........... 679 679 Shares subject to mandatory redemption(2)................ 350 350 Capital leases................. 74 8 9 10 11 12 24 Total..................... $96,760 $6,794 $5,426 $4,306 $3,947 $3,091 $73,196 (1) Other long term liabilities include guaranteed interest contracts, structured settlements, pension closeouts and certain annuity policies. (2) Amounts differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts above do not include related premiums and discounts or capital leases which are presented separately. (3) The Company anticipates that these amounts could be invested in these partnerships any time over the next five years, but are presented in the current period, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no material, individually or in the aggregate, purchase obligations and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. On April 11, 2003, an affiliate of the Company elected not to make future payments required by the terms of a non recourse loan obligation. The book value of this loan was $15 million at December 31, 2003. The Companys exposure under the terms of the applicable loan agreement is limited solely to its investment in certain securities held by an affiliate. Letters of Credit. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding approximately $828 million and $625 million, respectively, in letters of credit from various banks, all of which expire within one year. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 80 Support Agreements. In addition to the support agreements described above, Metropolitan Life entered into a net worth maintenance agreement with New England Life Insurance Company ("NELICO") at the time Metropolitan Life merged with New England Mutual Life Insurance Company. Under the agreement, Metropolitan Life agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause NELICO to have a minimum capital and surplus of $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less than the company action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current obligations on a timely basis. At December 31, 2003, the capital and surplus of NELICO was in excess of the minimum capital and surplus amount referenced above, and its total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent referenced RBC based amount calculated at December 31, 2003. In connection with the Companys acquisition of GenAmerica, Metropolitan Life entered into a net worth maintenance agreement with General American. Under the agreement, Metropolitan Life agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause General American to have a minimum capital and surplus of $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less than 180% of the company action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current obligations on a timely basis. The agreement was subsequently amended to provide that, for the five year period from 2003 through 2007, total adjusted capital must be maintained at a level not less than 200% of the company action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes. At December 31, 2003, the capital and surplus of General American was in excess of the minimum capital and surplus amount referenced above, and its total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent referenced RBC based amount calculated at December 31, 2003. Metropolitan Life has also entered into arrangements for the benefit of some of its other subsidiaries and affiliates to assist such subsidiaries and affiliates in meeting various jurisdictions regulatory requirements regarding capital and surplus and security deposits. In addition, Metropolitan Life has entered into a support arrangement with respect to a subsidiary under which Metropolitan Life may become responsible, in the event that the subsidiary becomes the subject of insolvency proceedings, for the payment of certain reinsurance recoverables due from the subsidiary to one or more of its cedents in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable reinsurance agreements. General American has agreed to guarantee the obligations of its subsidiary, Paragon Life Insurance Company, and certain obligations of its former subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance Company ("MetLife Investors"), First MetLife Investors Insurance Company and MetLife Investors Insurance Company of California. In addition, General American has entered into a contingent reinsurance agreement with MetLife Investors. Under this agreement, in the event that MetLife Investors statutory capital and surplus is less than $10 million or total adjusted capital falls below 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes, General American would assume as assumption reinsurance, subject to regulatory approvals and required consents, all of MetLife Investors life insurance policies and annuity contract liabilities. At December 31, 2003, the capital and surplus of MetLife Investors was in excess of the minimum capital and surplus amount referenced above, and its total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent referenced RBC based amount calculated at December 31, 2003. Management does not anticipate that these arrangements will place any significant demands upon the Companys liquidity resources. Litigation. Various litigation claims and assessments against the Company have arisen in the course of the Companys business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the Companys compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. It is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of potential losses except with respect to certain matters. In some of the matters, very large and or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial position, based on information currently known by the Companys management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal 81 proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Based on managements analysis of its expected cash inflows from operating activities, the dividends it receives from subsidiaries, including Metropolitan Life, that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows, management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the Company to make payments on debt, make cash dividend payments on its common stock, pay all operating expenses and meet its other obligations. The nature of the Companys diverse product portfolio and customer base lessen the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity. Consolidated cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7,363 million and $4,168 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $3,195 million increase in operating cash flow in 2003 over the comparable 2002 period is primarily attributable to sales growth in the group life, dental, disability and long term care businesses, as well as higher sales in retirement and savings structured settlement products. The acquisition of John Hancocks group business also contributed to sales growth in the 2003 period. In addition, growth in MetLife Banks customer deposits, accelerated prepayments of mortgage backed securities that have been previously purchased at a premium, and an increase in funds withheld related to reinsurance activity contributed to the increase in operating cash flows. These items were partially offset by the Companys contribution to its qualified defined benefit plans in December 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,168 million and $4,258 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The $90 million decrease in operating cash flow in 2002 over the 2001 comparable period is primarily due to a contribution by the Company to its defined benefit pension plans and a decrease in recoverables due from reinsurance in December 2002. This was partially offset by sales growth in the group life, dental, disability and long term care businesses, the sale of a significant retirement and savings contract in the second quarter of 2002, as well as additional sales of structured settlements and traditional annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was $17,688 million and $16,213 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $1,475 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2003 over the comparable 2002 period is primarily attributable to an increase in the purchase of fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loan origination, as well as an increase in the amount of securities lending cash collateral invested, which resulted from an expansion of the program. In addition, the Company invested income generated from operations and cash raised through the issuance of guaranteed investment contracts. These items were partially offset by lower income resulting from lower market rates and the June 2002 acquisition of Hidalgo. In addition, the 2003 period had less proceeds from sales of equity securities and real estate to use in investing activities. The 2002 period included proceeds from a significant sale of equity securities and cash generated by the Companys real estate sales program. Net cash used in investing activities was $16,213 million and $2,970 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities increased $13,243 million in 2002 over the comparable 2001 period, primarily due to an increase in the amount of securities lending cash collateral invested in connection with the program. In addition, the Company invested income generated from operations, cash raised through the issuance of guaranteed investment contracts and cash generated by the Companys real estate sales program in various financial instruments, including fixed maturities and mortgage loans on real estate. At December 31, 2001, the Company held cash equivalents that were subsequently invested in bonds and U.S. treasury notes in the first quarter of 2002. Additionally, certain contractholders transferred investments from the separate account to the general account. Net cash used in investing activities also increased due to the acquisition of Hidalgo. Net cash provided by financing activities was $11,735 million and $6,895 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $4,840 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2003 over the comparable 2002 period is due to an increase in policyholder account balances 82 primarily from sales of annuity products, as well as additional short term debt issued related to dollar roll activity. In 2003, the Company received $1,006 million on the settlement of common stock purchase contracts (see " The Holding Company Liquidity Sources Global Funding Sources"), issued $700 million of senior notes and had a decrease in cash used in the stock repurchase program as compared to 2002. These cash flows were partially offset by additional repayments of long term debt and a 10% increase in cash dividends per share in 2003 as compared to 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6,895 million and $2,751 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The $4,144 million increase in financing activities in 2002 over the comparable 2001 period was due to an increase in policyholder account balances primarily from sales of annuity products and the issuance of short term debt. In addition, the Company had a decrease in cash used in the stock repurchase program for 2002 as compared to 2001. These cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in long term debt issued. INSOLVENCY ASSESSMENTS Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed life insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Assessments levied against the Company from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2003 aggregated $7 million. The Company maintained a liability of $70 million at December 31, 2003 for future assessments in respect of currently impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. In the past five years, none of the aggregate assessments levied against MetLifes insurance subsidiaries has been material. The Company has established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that it considers adequate for assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates. APPLICATION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, ("EITF 03 1"). EITF 03 1 provides guidance on the disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments of debt and marketable equity investments that are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The adoption of EITF 03 1 requires the Company to include certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under SFAS 115 that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized. The initial adoption of EITF 03 1, which only required additional disclosures, did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") revised SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106 ("SFAS 132(r)"). SFAS 132(r) retains most of the disclosure requirements of SFAS 132 and requires additional disclosure about assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined postretirement plans. SFAS 132(r) is primarily effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003; however, certain disclosures about foreign plans and estimated future benefit payments are effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. The Companys adoption of SFAS 132(r) on December 31, 2003 did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial 83 statements since it only revises disclosure requirements. In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("FSP 106 1"), which permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the new legislation. The Company has elected to defer the accounting until further guidance is issued by the FASB. The measurements of the Companys postretirement accumulated benefit plan obligation and net periodic benefit cost do not reflect the effects of the new legislation. The guidance, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported information. In July 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03 1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts ("SOP 03 1"). SOP 03 1 provides guidance on (i) the classification and valuation of long duration contract liabilities, (ii) the accounting for sales inducements, and (iii) separate account presentation and valuation. SOP 03 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2003. As of January 1, 2004, the Company increased future policyholder benefits for various guaranteed minimum death and income benefits net of DAC and unearned revenue liability offsets under certain variable annuity and universal life contracts of approximately $40 million, net of income tax, which will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. Industry standards and practices continue to evolve relating to the valuation of liabilities relating to these types of benefits, which may result in further adjustments to the Companys measurement of liabilities associated with such benefits in subsequent accounting periods. Effective with the adoption of SOP 03 1, costs associated with enhanced or bonus crediting rates to contractholders will be deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract using assumptions consistent with the amortization of DAC. Prior to adoption of SOP 03 1, the costs associated with these sales inducements have been deferred and amortized over the contingent sales inducement period. This provision of SOP 03 1 will be applied prospectively to contracts. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company reclassified $115 million of ownership in its own separate accounts from other assets to fixed maturities available for sale and equity securities. This reclassification will have no effect on net income or other comprehensive income. In accordance with SOP 03 1s revised definition of a separate account, effective January 1, 2004, the Company also reclassified $1,678 million of separate account assets to general account investments and $1,678 million of separate account liabilities to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances. The net cumulative effect of this reclassification was insignificant. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that those instruments be classified as a liability or, in certain circumstances, an asset. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150, as of July 1, 2003, required the Company to reclassify $277 million of company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts from mezzanine equity to liabilities. In April 2003, the FASB cleared Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments ("Issue B36"). Issue B36 concluded that (i) a companys funds withheld payable and or receivable under certain reinsurance arrangements, and (ii) a debt instrument that incorporates credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor include an embedded derivative feature that is not clearly and closely related to the host contract. Therefore, the embedded derivative feature must be measured at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in fair value reported in income. Issue B36 became effective on October 1, 2003 and required the Company to increase policyholder account balances by $40 million, to decrease other invested assets by $1 million and to increase DAC by $2 million. These amounts, net of income tax of $13 million, were recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. As a result of the adoption of Issue B36, the Company recognized investment gains of $9 million, net of income tax, for the three month period ended December 31, 2003. 84 In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 149"). SFAS 149 amends and clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. Except for certain implementation guidance that is incorporated in SFAS 149 and already effective, SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The Companys adoption of SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. During 2003, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46") and its December 2003 revision ("FIN 46(r)"). Certain of the Companys asset backed securitizations, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment transactions, and investments in real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests meet the definition of a variable interest entity ("VIE") and must be consolidated, in accordance with the transition rules and effective dates, if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A VIE is defined as (i) any entity in which the equity investments at risk in such entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or (ii) any entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties. Effective February 1, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46 for VIEs created or acquired on or after February 1, 2003 and, effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46(r) with respect to interests in entities formerly considered special purpose entities ("SPEs"), including interests in asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46(r), the Company has elected to defer until March 31, 2004 the consolidation of interests in VIEs for non SPEs acquired prior to February 1, 2003 for which it is the primary beneficiary. The adoption of FIN 46 as of February 1, 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The adoption of the provisions of FIN 46(r) at December 31, 2003 did not require the Company to consolidate any additional VIEs that were not previously consolidated. During 2003, the Company adopted or applied the following accounting standards and or interpretations: (i) FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others; (ii) SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure; (iii) SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities; and (iv) SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. None of the accounting standards and or interpretations described in this paragraph had a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. During 2002, the Company adopted or applied the following accounting standards: (i) SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS 141"), (ii) SFAS No. 142, and (iii) SFAS No. 144. In accordance with SFAS 141, the elimination of $5 million of negative goodwill was reported in net income in the first quarter of 2002 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142. Amortization of goodwill prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 was $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Amortization of other intangible assets was not material for the years December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2002 and recorded a $5 million charge to earnings relating to the impairment of certain goodwill assets as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. There was no impairment of identified intangible assets or significant reclassifications between goodwill and other intangible assets at January 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements other than the presentation as discontinued operations of net investment income and net investment gains related to operations of real estate on which the Company initiated disposition activities subsequent to January 1, 2002 and the classification of such real estate as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. INVESTMENTS The Company had total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $221.8 billion and $190.7 billion, respectively. In addition, the Company had $75.8 billion and $59.7 billion held in its separate 85 accounts, for which the Company generally does not bear investment risk, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys primary investment objective is to maximize net investment income consistent with acceptable risk parameters. The Company is exposed to three primary sources of investment risk: credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates; and market valuation risk. The Company manages risk through in house fundamental analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk and market valuation risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and valuation risk through geographic, property type, and product type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management strategies, product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, and proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. The following table summarizes the Companys cash and invested assets at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 CARRYING % OF CARRYING % OF VALUE TOTAL VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Fixed maturities available for sale, at fair value.......................................... $167,752 75.6% $140,288 73.6% Mortgage loans on real estate.................... 26,249 11.8 25,086 13.2 Policy loans..................................... 8,749 4.0 8,580 4.5 Cash and cash equivalents........................ 3,733 1.7 2,323 1.2 Real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment............................ 4,714 2.1 3,926 2.1 Other invested assets............................ 4,645 2.1 3,727 1.9 Equity securities, at fair value and other limited partnership interests.................. 4,075 1.8 4,008 2.1 Short term investments........................... 1,826 0.8 1,921 1.0 Real estate held for sale........................ 89 0.1 799 0.4 Total cash and invested assets.............. $221,832 100.0% $190,658 100.0% 86 INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income, including net investment income from discontinued operations and scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133"), on general account cash and invested assets totaled $11,772 million, $11,453 million and $11,380 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The annualized yields on general account cash and invested assets, including net investment income from discontinued operations and scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, and excluding all net investment gains and losses, were 6.67%, 7.20% and 7.56% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decline in annualized yields is due primarily to the decline in interest rates during these years. The following table illustrates the net investment income and annualized yields on average assets for each of the components of the Companys investment portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 YIELD(1) AMOUNT YIELD(1) AMOUNT YIELD(1) AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) FIXED MATURITIES:(2) Investment income................. 6.89% $ 8,502 7.46% $ 8,076 7.89% $ 8,018 Net investment gains (losses).....

Investment income for fixed maturities includes prepayment fees and income from the securities lending program. Fixed maturity investment income has been reduced by rebates paid under the securities lending program. (3) Investment income from mortgage loans on real estate includes prepayment fees. (4) Real estate and real estate joint venture income is shown net of depreciation of $183 million, $227 million and $220 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Real estate and real estate joint venture income includes amounts classified as discontinued operations of $52 million, $160 million and $169 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts are net of depreciation of $15 million, $66 million and $93 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net investment gains and losses include $421 million and $582 million of gains classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(6) Adjustments to investment gains and losses include amortization of DAC, charges and credits to participating contracts and adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses. 88 FIXED MATURITIES Fixed maturities consist principally of publicly traded and privately placed debt securities, and represented 75.6% and 73.6% of total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Based on estimated fair value, public fixed maturities represented $147,489 million, or 87.9%, and $121,191 million, or 86.4%, of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Based on estimated fair value, private fixed maturities represented $20,263 million, or 12.1%, and $19,097 million, or 13.6%, of total fixed maturities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company invests in privately placed fixed maturities to (i) obtain higher yields than can ordinarily be obtained with comparable public market securities; (ii) provide the Company with protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral; and (iii) increase diversification. However, the Company may not freely trade its privately placed fixed maturities because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid markets. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using present value or valuation techniques. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counter party. Factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories called "NAIC designations." The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated "Baa3" or higher by Moodys Investors Services ("Moodys"), or rated "BBB " or higher by Standard & Poors ("S&P")) by such rating organizations. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated "Ba1" or lower by Moodys, or rated "BB+" or lower by S&P). The following table presents the Companys total fixed maturities by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designation and the equivalent ratings of the NAIC, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair value, that each designation comprises at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 DECEMBER 31, 2002 NAIC RATING AGENCY AMORTIZED ESTIMATED % OF AMORTIZED ESTIMATED % OF RATING DESIGNATION(1) COST FAIR VALUE TOTAL COST FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 1 Aaa/Aa/A.................... $106,779 $112,333 67.0% $ 88,201 $ 94,225 67.2% 2 Baa......................... 39,006 42,057 25.0 32,093 33,997 24.2 3 Ba.......................... 7,388 8,011 4.8 7,519 7,437 5.3 4 B........................... 3,578 3,814 2.3 3,636 3,408 2.4 5 Caa and lower............... 630 629 0.4 404 295 0.3 6 In or near default.......... 341 371 0.2 482 479 0.3 Subtotal.................... 157,722 167,215 99.7 132,335 139,841 99.7 Redeemable preferred 611 537 0.3 564 447 0.3 stock.......................

Comparisons between NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The rating agency designations are based on the availability and the lower of the applicable ratings between Moodys and S&P. The current period ratings are now presented so that the consolidated rating will be equal to the Moodys or S&P rating, whichever is more conservative. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then the MetLife rating will be used. Prior period ratings have been restated to conform with this presentation. 89 Based on estimated fair values, investment grade fixed maturities comprised 92.0% and 91.4% of total fixed maturities in the general account at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table shows the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturities, by contractual maturity dates (excluding scheduled sinking funds) at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 DECEMBER 31, 2002 AMORTIZED ESTIMATED AMORTIZED ESTIMATED COST FAIR VALUE COST FAIR VALUE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Due in one year or less.................... $ 5,381 $ 5,542 $ 4,592 $ 4,662 Due after one year through five years...... 30,893 32,431 26,200 27,354 Due after five years through ten years..... 29,342 31,830 23,297 24,987 Due after ten years........................ 39,011 43,064 35,507 38,452 Subtotal.............................. 104,627 112,867 89,596 95,455 Mortgage backed and other asset backed securities............................... 53,095 54,348 42,739 44,386 Subtotal.............................. 157,722 167,215 132,335 139,841 Redeemable preferred stock................. 611 537 564 447 Total fixed maturities................ $158,333 $167,752 $132,899 $140,288 Bonds not due at a single maturity date have been included in the above table in the year of final maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to the exercise of prepayment options. The fixed maturities portfolio is diversified across a broad range of asset sectors, and the asset mix did not change significantly in 2003. The following tables set forth the amortized cost, gross unrealized gain and loss, and estimated fair value of the Companys fixed maturities by sector, as well as the percentage of the total fixed maturities holdings that each sector is comprised of at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 GROSS UNREALIZED AMORTIZED ESTIMATED % OF COST GAIN LOSS FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) U.S. corporate securities............... $ 56,757 $ 3,886 $252 $ 60,391 36.0% Mortgage backed securities.............. 30,836 720 102 31,454 18.8 Foreign corporate securities............ 21,727 2,194 79 23,842 14.2 U.S. treasuries/agencies................ 14,707 1,264 26 15,945 9.5 Asset backed securities................. 11,736 187 60 11,863 7.1 Commercial mortgage backed securities... 10,523 530 22 11,031 6.6 Foreign government securities........... 7,789 1,003 28 8,764 5.2 State and political subdivisions........ 3,155 209 15 3,349 2.0 Other fixed income assets............... 492 167 83 576 0.3 Total bonds........................ 157,722 10,160 667 167,215 99.7 Redeemable preferred stocks............. 611 2 76 537 0.3 Total fixed maturities............. $158,333 $10,162 $743 $167,752 100.0% 90 DECEMBER 31, 2002 GROSS UNREALIZED AMORTIZED ESTIMATED % OF COST GAIN LOSS FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) U.S. corporate securities.............. $ 47,021 $3,193 $ 957 $ 49,257 35.1% Mortgage backed securities............. 26,966 1,076 16 28,026 20.0 Foreign corporate securities........... 18,001 1,435 207 19,229 13.7 U.S. treasuries/agencies............... 14,373 1,565 4 15,934 11.4 Asset backed securities................ 9,483 228 208 9,503 6.8 Commercial mortgage backed securities........................... 6,290 573 6 6,857 4.9 Foreign government securities.......... 7,012 636 52 7,596 5.4 State and political subdivisions....... 2,580 182 20 2,742 1.9 Other fixed income assets.............. 609 191 103 697 0.5 Total bonds....................... 132,335 9,079 1,573 139,841 99.7 Redeemable preferred stocks............ 564 117 447 0.3 Total fixed maturities............ $132,899 $9,079 $1,690 $140,288 100.0% Potential Problem, Problem and Restructured Fixed Maturities. The Company monitors fixed maturities to identify investments that management considers to be potential problems or problems. The Company also monitors investments that have been restructured. The Company defines potential problem securities in the fixed maturity category as securities of an issuer deemed to be experiencing significant operating problems or difficult industry conditions. The Company uses various criteria, including the following, to identify potential problem securities: debt service coverage or cash flow falling below certain thresholds which vary according to the issuers industry and other relevant factors; significant declines in revenues or margins; violation of financial covenants; public securities trading at a substantial discount as a result of specific credit concerns; and other subjective factors. The Company defines problem securities in the fixed maturities category as securities with principal or interest payments in default, securities to be restructured pursuant to commenced negotiations, or securities issued by a debtor that has entered into bankruptcy. The Company defines restructured securities in the fixed maturities category as securities to which the Company has granted a concession that it would not have otherwise considered but for the financial difficulties of the obligor. The Company enters into a restructuring when it believes it will realize a greater economic value under the new terms rather than through liquidation or disposition. The terms of the restructuring may involve some or all of the following characteristics: a reduction in the interest rate, an extension of the maturity date, an exchange of debt for equity or a partial forgiveness of principal or interest. 91 The following table presents the estimated fair value of the Companys total fixed maturities classified as performing, potential problem, problem and restructured at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 DECEMBER 31, 2002 ESTIMATED % OF ESTIMATED % OF FAIR VALUE TOTAL FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Performing....................................... $167,125 99.6% $139,452 99.4% Potential problem................................ 282 0.2 450 0.3 Problem.......................................... 264 0.2 358 0.3 Restructured..................................... 81 0.0 28 0.0 Total....................................... $167,752 100.0% $140,288 100.0% Fixed Maturity Impairment. The Company classifies all of its fixed maturities as available for sale and marks them to market through other comprehensive income. All securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the Companys process for identifying other than temporary impairments. The Company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired. The assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on managements case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Management considers a wide range of factors, as described below, about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to, the following: length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost; potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties, including a review of all securities of the issuer, including its known subsidiaries and affiliates, regardless of the form of the Companys ownership; potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector; potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; and other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. The Companys review of its fixed maturities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities: (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and (iii) securities where the estimated value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater. The first two categories have generally been adversely impacted by the downturn in the financial markets and overall economic conditions. While all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment, the Companys experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment, and often, fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve. The Company records writedowns as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed maturities accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. Writedowns of fixed maturities were $338 million and $1,264 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys three largest writedowns totaled $125 million and $352 million for the 92 years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The circumstances that gave rise to these impairments were either financial restructurings or bankruptcy filings. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company sold fixed maturities with a fair value of $30,714 million and $14,597 million at a loss of $486 million and $894 million, respectively. The following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by: DECEMBER 31, 2003 GROSS UNREALIZED % OF LOSSES TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Less than 20%............................................... $677 91.1% 20% or more for less than six months........................ 22 3.0 20% or more for six months or greater....................... 44 5.9 Total.................................................. $743 100.0% The gross unrealized loss related to the Companys fixed maturities at December 31, 2003 was $743 million. These fixed maturities mature as follows: 1% due in one year or less; 23% due in greater than one year to five years; 18% due in greater than five years to ten years; and 58% due in greater than ten years (calculated as a percentage of amortized cost). Additionally, such securities are concentrated by sector in U.S. corporates (34%), mortgage backed (17%) and foreign corporates (11%); and are concentrated by industry in mortgage backed (13%), utilities (12%) and finance (8%) (calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss). Non investment grade securities represent 6% of the $30,881 million fair value and 20% of the $743 million gross unrealized loss on fixed maturities. The following table presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized losses and number of securities for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by less than 20%, or 20% or more for: DECEMBER 31, 2003 GROSS UNREALIZED AMORTIZED COST LOSSES NUMBER OF SECURITIES LESS THAN 20% OR LESS THAN 20% OR LESS THAN 20% OR 20% MORE 20% MORE 20% MORE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Less than six months............ $24,926 $ 67 $449 $22 1,331 18 Six months or greater but less than nine months.............. 3,217 19 84 4 264 2 Nine months or greater but less than twelve months............ 266 17 7 4 45 3 Twelve months or greater........ 2,999 113 137 36 311 19 Total...................... $31,408 $216 $677 $66 1,951 42 The category of fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by less than 20% is comprised of 1,951 securities with an amortized cost of $31,408 million and a gross unrealized loss of $677 million at December 31, 2003. These fixed maturities mature as follows: 1% due in one year or less; 23% due in greater than one year to five years; 18% due in greater than five years to ten years; and 58% due in greater than ten years (calculated as a percentage of amortized cost). Additionally, such securities are concentrated by sector in U.S. corporates (33%) and mortgage backed (18%); and are concentrated by industry in mortgage backed (14%), utilities (13%) and finance (7%) (calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss). Non investment grade securities represent 5% of the $30,731 million fair value and 15% of the $677 million gross unrealized loss. 93 The category of fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months is comprised of 18 securities with an amortized cost of $67 million and a gross unrealized loss of $22 million at December 31, 2003. These fixed maturities mature as follows: 1% due in greater than one year to five years; 64% due in greater than five years to ten years; and 35% due in greater than ten years (calculated as a percentage of amortized cost). Additionally, such securities are concentrated by sector in foreign governments (41%) and asset backed (35%); and are concentrated by industry in asset backed (35%) and finance (23%) (calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss). Non investment grade securities represent 83% of the $45 million fair value and 82% of the $22 million gross unrealized loss. The total of fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater is comprised of 24 securities with an amortized cost of $149 million and a gross unrealized loss of $44 million at December 31, 2003. These fixed maturities mature as follows: 27% due in greater than five years to ten years; and 73% due in greater than ten years (calculated as a percentage of amortized cost). Additionally, such securities are concentrated by security type in U.S. corporates (57%) and asset backed (18%); and are concentrated by industry in transportation (53%), finance (24%) and asset backed (18%) (calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss). Non investment grade securities represent 48% of the $105 million fair value and 60% of the $44 million gross unrealized loss. The Company held two fixed maturity securities each with a gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2003 greater than $10 million. One of these securities represents 25% of the gross unrealized loss on fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater. The security is in the U.S. corporate sector, and the estimated fair value and gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2003 was $14 million and $11 million, respectively. The Company analyzed this fixed maturity security as of December 31, 2003 to determine whether this security was other than temporarily impaired. The Company believes that the estimated fair value of this security, which is in the transportation industry, was depressed as a result of generally difficult economic and market conditions. The Company believes that the analysis of the security indicated that the financial strength, liquidity, leverage, future outlook and or recent management actions supports the view that the security was not other than temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2003.

The Company maintains a diversified corporate bond portfolio across industries and issuers. The portfolio does not have exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of the total invested assets of the portfolio. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys combined holdings in the ten issuers to which it had the greatest exposure totaled $4,683 million and $2,973 million, respectively, which was less than 3% and 2%, respectively, of the Companys total invested assets at such date. The exposure to the largest single issuer of corporate bonds held at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $618 million and $385 million, respectively. 94 At December 31, 2003 and 2002, investments of $16,572 million and $14,778 million, respectively, or 69.5% and 76.9%, respectively, of the Yankee/Foreign sector, represented exposure to traditional Yankee bonds. This exposure was U.S. dollar denominated and was concentrated by security type in industrial and financial institutions. The Company diversifies the Yankee/Foreign portfolio by country and issuer. The Company has hedged all of its material exposure to foreign currency risk in its invested assets. In the Companys international insurance operations, both its assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies. Foreign currency denominated securities supporting U.S. dollar liabilities are generally swapped back into U.S. dollars. Mortgage Backed Securities. The following table shows the types of mortgage backed securities the Company held at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 DECEMBER 31, 2002 ESTIMATED % OF ESTIMATED % OF FAIR VALUE TOTAL FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Pass through securities.......................... $15,427 36.3% $12,515 35.9% Collateralized mortgage obligations.............. 16,027 37.7 15,511 44.5 Total mortgage backed securities............ 31,454 74.0 28,026 80.4 Commercial mortgage backed securities............ 11,031 26.0 6,857 19.6 Total....................................... $42,485 100.0% $34,883 100.0% At December 31, 2003 and 2002, pass through and collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $31,454 million and $28,026 million, respectively, or 74.0% and 80.4%, respectively, of total mortgage backed securities, and a majority of these amounts represented agency issued pass through and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Government National Mortgage Association. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $6,992 million and $3,598 million, respectively, or 63.4% and 52.5%, respectively, of the commercial mortgage backed securities, and $31,210 million and $27,590 million, respectively, or 99.2% and 98.4%, respectively, of the pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, were rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys or S&P. The principal risks inherent in holding residential mortgage backed securities are prepayment and extension risks, which will affect the timing of when cash will be received and are dependent on the level of mortgage interest rates. Prepayment risk is the unexpected increase in principal payments primarily as a result of homeowner refinancing. Extension risk relates to the unexpected slowdown in principal payments. The Companys active monitoring of its residential mortgage backed securities mitigates exposure to the cash flow uncertainties associated with these risks. The principal risks in owning commercial mortgage backed securities are related to structural, credit and capital market risks. Structural risks include the securitys priority in the issuers capital structure and the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the underlying real estate collateral. Credit risk results from potential defaults on the underlying commercial mortgages. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates and the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace. Asset Backed Securities. Asset backed securities, which include home equity loans, credit card receivables, collateralized debt obligations and automobile receivables, are purchased both to diversify the overall risks of the Companys fixed maturity assets and to provide income. The Companys asset backed securities are diversified both by sector and by issuer. Credit card and home equity loan securitizations, each accounting for about 29% of the total holdings, constitute the largest exposures in the Companys asset backed securities portfolio. Asset backed securities generally have limited sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Approximately $7,528 million and $4,912 million, or 63.5% and 51.7%, of total asset backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys or S&P at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 95 The principal risks in holding asset backed securities are related to structural, credit and capital market risks. Structural risks include the securitys priority in the issuers capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks include consumer or corporate credits, such as credit card holders, equipment lessees, and corporate obligors. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates and the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace. Structured Investment Transactions. The Company participates in structured investment transactions, primarily asset securitizations and structured notes. These transactions enhance the Companys total return of the investment portfolio principally by generating management fee income on asset securitizations and by providing equity based returns on debt securities through structured notes and similar instruments. The Company sponsors financial asset securitizations of high yield debt securities, investment grade bonds and structured finance securities and also is the collateral manager and a beneficial interest holder in such transactions. As the collateral manager, the Company earns management fees on the outstanding securitized asset balance, which are recorded in income as earned. When the Company transfers assets to a bankruptcy remote SPE and surrenders control over the transferred assets, the transaction is accounted for as a sale. Gains or losses on securitizations are determined with reference to the carrying amount of the financial assets transferred, which is allocated to the assets sold and the beneficial interests retained based on relative fair values at the date of transfer. Beneficial interests in securitizations are carried at fair value in fixed maturities. Income on these beneficial interests is recognized using the prospective method in accordance with EITF Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Certain Investments ("EITF 99 20"). The SPEs used to securitize assets are not consolidated by the Company because the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities based on the framework provided in FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 31, 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46(r)"). Prior to the adoption of FIN 46(r), such SPEs were not consolidated because they did not meet the criteria for consolidation under previous accounting guidance. The Company purchases or receives beneficial interests in SPEs, which generally acquire financial assets, including corporate equities, debt securities and purchased options. The Company has not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the SPEs and the Companys exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value of the beneficial interests in the SPEs. The Company uses the beneficial interests as part of its risk management strategy, including asset liability management. These SPEs are not consolidated by the Company because the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities based on the framework provided in FIN 46(r). Prior to the adoption of FIN 46(r), such SPEs were not consolidated because they did not meet the criteria for consolidation under previous accounting guidance. These beneficial interests are generally structured notes, as defined by EITF Issue No. 96 12, Recognition of Interest Income and Balance Sheet Classification of Structured Notes, which are included in fixed maturities, and their income is recognized using the retrospective interest method or the level yield method, as appropriate. Impairments of these beneficial interests are included in net investment gains and losses. MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE The Companys mortgage loans on real estate are collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. Mortgage loans on real estate comprised 11.8% and 13.2% of the Companys total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The carrying value of mortgage loans on real estate is stated at original cost net of repayments, amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and 96 valuation allowances.

The Company monitors its mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis. Through this monitoring process, the Company reviews loans that are restructured, delinquent or under foreclosure and identifies those that management considers to be potentially delinquent. These loan classifications are consistent with those used in industry practice. The Company defines potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in managements opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent. The Company defines delinquent mortgage loans, consistent with industry practice, as loans in which two or more interest or principal payments are past due. The Company defines mortgage loans under foreclosure as loans in which foreclosure proceedings have formally commenced. The Company defines restructured mortgage loans as loans in which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtors financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company reviews all mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis and tenant creditworthiness. The Company also reviews loan to value ratios and debt coverage ratios for restructured loans, delinquent loans, loans under foreclosure, potentially delinquent loans, loans with an existing valuation allowance, loans maturing within two years and loans with a loan to value ratio greater than 90% as determined in the prior year. The principal risks in holding commercial mortgage loans are property specific, supply and demand, financial and capital market risks. Property specific risks include the geographic location of the property, the physical condition of the property, the diversification of tenants and the rollover of their leases and the ability of the property manager to attract tenants and manage expenses. Supply and demand risks include changes in the supply and or demand for rental space, which cause changes in vacancy rates and or rental rates. Financial risks include the overall level of debt on the property and the amount of principal repaid during the loan term. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates, the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace and the capital available for loan refinancing. The Company establishes valuation allowances for loans that it deems impaired, as determined through its mortgage review process. The Companys valuation allowance is established both on a loan specific basis for those loans where a property or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future default, as well as for pools of loans with similar high risk characteristics where a property specific or market risk has not been identified. Loans that are individually reviewed are evaluated based on the definition of impaired loans consistent with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairments of a Loan ("SFAS 114"), as loans on which it probably will not collect all amounts due according to applicable contractual terms of the agreement. The Company bases valuation allowances upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the value of the loans collateral. The Company records valuation allowances as investment losses. The Company records subsequent adjustments to allowances as investment gains or losses. The allowance for loan loss for pools of other loans with similar characteristics is established in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies 98 ("SFAS 5"), when a loss contingency exists. A loss contingency exists when the likelihood that a future event will occur is probable based on past events. SFAS 5 works in conjunction with, but does not overlap with, SFAS 114. The Company applies SFAS 5 to groups of loans with similar characteristics based on property types and loan to value risk factors. The Company records adjustments to its loan loss allowance as investment losses.

The Company diversifies its agricultural mortgage loans by both geographic region and product type. The Company manages these investments through a network of regional offices and field professionals overseen by its investment department. Approximately 67% of the $5,327 million of agricultural mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2003 were subject to rate resets prior to maturity. A substantial portion of these loans generally is successfully renegotiated and remains outstanding to maturity. The process and policies for monitoring the agricultural mortgage loans and classifying them by performance status are generally the same as those for the commercial loans. 99 The following table presents the amortized cost and valuation allowances for agricultural mortgage loans distributed by loan classification at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 DECEMBER 31, 2002 % OF % OF AMORTIZED % OF VALUATION AMORTIZED AMORTIZED % OF VALUATION AMORTIZED COST(1) TOTAL ALLOWANCE COST COST(1) TOTAL ALLOWANCE COST (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Performing.......................... $5,162 96.7% $ 0.0% $4,980 96.7% $ 0.0% Restructured........................ 111 2.1 1 0.9% 140 2.7 5 3.6% Delinquent or under foreclosure..... 36 0.7 2 5.6% 14 0.3 0.0% Potentially delinquent.............. 24 0.5 3 12.5% 18 0.3 1 5.6% Total........................... $5,333 100.0% $ 6 0.1% $5,152 100.0% $6 0.1% (1) Amortized cost is equal to carrying value before valuation allowances.

Supply and demand risks include the supply and demand for the commodities produced on the specific property and the related price for those commodities. Financial risks include the overall level of debt on the property and the amount of principal repaid during the loan term. Capital market risks include the general level of interest rates, the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace and the capital available for loan refinancing. REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES The Companys real estate and real estate joint venture investments consist of commercial, residential and agricultural properties located primarily throughout the U.S. The Company manages these investments through a network of regional offices overseen by its investment department. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of the Companys real estate, real estate joint ventures and real estate held for sale was $4,803 million and $4,725 million, respectively, or 2.2%, and 2.5% of total cash and invested assets, respectively. The carrying value of real estate is stated at depreciated cost net of impairments and valuation allowances. The carrying value of real estate joint ventures is stated at the Companys equity in the real estate joint ventures net of impairments and valuation allowances. The following table presents the carrying value of 100 the Companys real estate, real estate joint ventures, real estate held for sale and real estate acquired upon foreclosure at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 DECEMBER 31, 2002 CARRYING % OF CARRYING % OF TYPE VALUE TOTAL VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Real estate held for investment..................... $4,274 89.0% $3,546 75.0% Real estate joint ventures held for investment...... 438 9.1 377 8.0 Foreclosed real estate held for investment.......... 2 0.1 3 0.1 4,714 98.2 3,926 83.1 Real estate held for sale........................... 88 1.8 792 16.8 Foreclosed real estate held for sale................ 1 0.0 7 0.1 89 1.8 799 16.9 Total real estate, real estate joint ventures and real estate held for sale......................... $4,803 100.0% $4,725 100.0% Office properties represent 58% of the Companys equity real estate portfolio at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. The average occupancy level of office properties was 89% and 92% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Ongoing management of these investments includes quarterly valuations, as well as an annual market update and review of each propertys budget, financial returns, lease rollover status and the Companys exit strategy. The Company adjusts the carrying value of real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the property may not be recoverable. The Company writes down impaired real estate to estimated fair value, when the carrying value of the real estate exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate. The Company records writedowns as investment losses and reduces the cost basis of the properties accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. The Companys real estate equity portfolio at December 31, 2003 was mainly comprised of a core portfolio of multi tenanted office buildings with high tenant credit quality, net leased properties and apartments. The objective is to maximize earnings by building upon and strengthening the core portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions. The Company took advantage of a significant demand for Class A, institutional grade properties and sold certain real estate holdings in its portfolio mostly during the fourth quarter of 2002. This sales program did not represent any fundamental change in the Companys investment strategy. Once the Company identifies a property that is expected to be sold within one year and commences a firm plan for marketing the property, in accordance with SFAS 144, the Company, if applicable, classifies the property as held for sale and reports the related net investment income and any resulting investment gains and losses as discontinued operations. Further, the Company establishes and periodically revises, if necessary, a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying value of the property to its expected sales value, less associated selling costs, if it is lower than the propertys carrying value. The Company records valuation allowances as investment losses and subsequent adjustments as investment gains or losses. If circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, the property is expected to be on the market longer than anticipated, a held for sale property is generally reclassified to held for investment and measured as such. The Companys carrying value of real estate held for sale, including real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, in the amounts of $89 million and $799 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are net of valuation allowances of $12 million and $11 million, 101 respectively. There were no impairments at December 31, 2003; however, the December 31, 2002 amount included a net impairment of $5 million. The Company records real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at the lower of estimated fair value or the carrying value of the mortgage loan at the date of foreclosure. Certain of the Companys investments in real estate joint ventures meet the definition of a VIE under FIN 46(r). See " Variable Interest Entities." On August 28, 2003, the Company (through one of its subsidiaries) acquired the Sears Tower building through the acquisition of a controlling interest in a partnership holding title to the building. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, MetLife entered into a marketing agreement to sell one of its real estate investments, the Sears Tower, and reclassified the property from Real Estate Held for Investments to Real Estate Held for Sale. The carrying value of the property as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $700 million. EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS The Companys carrying value of equity securities, which primarily consist of investments in common and preferred stocks and mutual fund interests, was $1,598 million and $1,613 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Substantially all of the common stock is publicly traded on major securities exchanges. The carrying value of the other limited partnership interests (which primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment funds that make private equity investments in companies in the U.S. and overseas) was $2,477 million and $2,395 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company classifies its investments in common stocks as available for sale and marks them to market, except for non marketable private equities, which are generally carried at cost. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited partnership interests in which it has more than a minor interest, has influence over the partnerships operating and financial policies and does not have a controlling interest. The Company uses the cost method for minor interest investments and when it has virtually no influence over the partnerships operating and financial policies. The Companys investments in equity securities excluding partnerships represented 0.7% and 0.8% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Equity securities include private equity securities with an estimated fair value of $432 million and $443 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company may not freely trade its private equity securities because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid markets. The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were $1,380 million and $1,667 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company anticipates that these amounts could be invested in these partnerships any time over the next five years. Some of the Companys investments in other limited partnership interests meet the definition of a VIE under FIN 46(r). See " Variable Interest Entities." 102 The following tables set forth the cost, gross unrealized gain or loss and estimated fair value of the Companys equity securities, as well as the percentage of the total equity securities at: DECEMBER 31, 2003 GROSS UNREALIZED ESTIMATED % OF COST GAIN LOSS FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Equity Securities: Common stocks.............................. $ 620 $334 $2 $ 952 59.6% Nonredeemable preferred stocks............. 602 48 4 646 40.4 Total equity securities................. $1,222 $382 $6 $1,598 100.0% DECEMBER 31, 2002 GROSS UNREALIZED ESTIMATED % OF COST GAIN LOSS FAIR VALUE TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Equity Securities: Common stocks.............................. $ 877 $115 $79 $ 913 56.6% Nonredeemable preferred stocks............. 679 25 4 700 43.4 Total equity securities................. $1,556 $140 $83 $1,613 100.0% Potential Problem and Problem Equity Securities and Other Limited Partnership Interests. The Company monitors its equity securities and other limited partnership interests on a continual basis. Through this monitoring process, the Company identifies investments that management considers to be problems or potential problems. Potential problem equity securities and other limited partnership interests are defined as securities issued by a company that is experiencing significant operating problems or difficult industry conditions. Criteria generally indicative of these problems or conditions are (i) cash flows falling below varying thresholds established for the industry and other relevant factors; (ii) significant declines in revenues and or margins; (iii) public securities trading at a substantial discount compared to original cost as a result of specific credit concerns; and (iv) other information that becomes available. Problem equity securities and other limited partnership interests are defined as securities (i) in which significant declines in revenues and or margins threaten the ability of the issuer to continue operating; or (ii) where the issuer has entered into bankruptcy. Equity Security Impairment. The Company classifies all of its equity securities as available for sale and marks them to market through other comprehensive income. All securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the Companys process for identifying other than temporary impairments. The Company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired. The assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on managements case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Management considers a wide range of factors, as described below, about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. 103 Considerations used by the Company in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to, the following: length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost; potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties, including a review of all securities of the issuer, including its known subsidiaries and affiliates, regardless of the form of the Companys ownership; potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector; potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; and other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. Equity securities or other limited partnership interests which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired are written down to fair value. The Company records writedowns as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the equity securities accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value. Writedowns of equity securities and other limited partnership interests were $108 million and $191 million years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company sold equity securities with an estimated fair value of $62 million and $915 million, at a loss of $13 million and $85 million, respectively. The gross unrealized loss related to the Companys equity securities at December 31, 2003 was $6 million. Such securities are concentrated by security type in common stock (36%) and preferred stock (63%); and are concentrated by industry in financial (57%) and domestic broad market mutual funds (7%) (calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss). The following table presents the cost, gross unrealized losses and number of securities for equity securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by less than 20%, or 20% or more for: DECEMBER 31, 2003 GROSS UNREALIZED NUMBER OF COST LOSSES SECURITIES LESS THAN 20% OR LESS THAN 20% OR LESS THAN 20% OR 20% MORE 20% MORE 20% MORE (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Less than six months............ $58 $1 $6 $ 19 1 Six months or greater but less than nine months.............. Nine months or greater but less than twelve months............ 2 Twelve months or greater........ 22 14 Total......................... $80 $1 $6 $ 33 3 The Companys review of its equity security exposure includes the analysis of total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities: (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and (iii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more for six months or greater. While all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment, the Companys experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment, and often, fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve. 104 The following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for equity securities at December 31, 2003 where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by: DECEMBER 31, 2003 GROSS UNREALIZED % OF LOSSES TOTAL (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Less than 20%............................................... $6 $ 100% 20% or more for less than six months........................ 20% or more for six months or greater....................... Total....................................................... $6 100.0% The category of equity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost by less than 20% is comprised of 33 equity securities with a cost of $80 million and a gross unrealized loss of $6 million. These securities are concentrated by security type in common stock (33%) and preferred stock (65%); and concentrated by industry in financial (59%) and communications (3%) (calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss). The significant factors considered at December 31, 2003 in the review of equity securities for other than temporary impairment were as a result of generally difficult economic and market conditions. The Company did not hold any equity securities with a gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2003 greater than $5 million. OTHER INVESTED ASSETS The Companys other invested assets consist principally of leveraged leases and funds withheld at interest of $3.9 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The leveraged leases are recorded net of non recourse debt. The Company participates in lease transactions, which are diversified by industry, asset type and geographic area. The Company regularly reviews residual values and writes down residuals to expected values as needed. Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. For agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets supporting the reinsured policies equal to the net statutory reserves are withheld and continue to be legally owned by the ceding company. Other invested assets also include the fair value of embedded derivatives related to funds withheld and modified coinsurance contracts. Interest accrues to these funds withheld at rates defined by the treaty terms and may be contractually specified or directly related to the investment portfolio. The Companys other invested assets represented 2.1% and 1.9% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative instruments to manage risk through one of five principal risk management strategies: the hedging of (i) liabilities; (ii) invested assets; (iii) portfolios of assets or liabilities; (iv) net investment in certain foreign operations; and (v) firm commitments and forecasted transactions. Additionally, the Company enters into income generation and replication derivative transactions as permitted by its insurance subsidiaries Derivatives Use Plans approved by the applicable state insurance departments. The Companys derivative hedging strategy employs a variety of instruments, including financial futures, financial forwards, interest rate, credit default and foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards and options, including caps and floors. 105 The table below provides a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivative financial instruments held at December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 CURRENT MARKET CURRENT MARKET OR FAIR VALUE OR FAIR VALUE NOTIONAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT ASSETS LIABILITIES AMOUNT ASSETS LIABILITIES (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Financial futures...................... $ 1,348 $ 8 $ 30 $ 4 $ $ Interest rate swaps.................... 9,944 189 36 3,866 196 126 Floors................................. 325 5 325 9 Caps................................... 9,345 29 8,040 Financial forwards..................... 1,310 2 3 1,945 12 Foreign currency swaps................. 4,710 9 796 2,371 92 181 Options................................ 6,065 7 6,472 9 Foreign currency forwards.............. 695 5 32 54 1 Credit default swaps................... 615 2 1 376 2 Total contractual commitments........ $34,357 $256 $898 $23,453 $308 $320 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES The Company has adopted the provisions of FIN 46 and FIN 46(r). See " Recent Accounting Standards." At December 31, 2003, FIN 46(r) did not require the Company to consolidate any additional VIEs that were not previously consolidated. The following table presents the total assets of and maximum exposure to loss relating to VIEs for which the Company has concluded that (i) it is the primary beneficiary and which will be consolidated in the Companys financial statements beginning March 31, 2004, and (ii) it holds significant valuable interests but it is not the primary beneficiary and which will not be consolidated: DECEMBER 31, 2003 PRIMARY BENEFICIARY(1) NOT PRIMARY BENEFICIARY MAXIMUM MAXIMUM TOTAL EXPOSURE TOTAL EXPOSURE ASSETS(2) TO LOSS(3) ASSETS(2) TO LOSS(3) (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) SPES: Asset backed securitizations and Collateralized debt obligations........... $ $ $2,400 $20 NON SPES: Real estate joint ventures(4)............... 617 238 42 59 Other limited partnerships(5)............... 29 27 459 10 Total.................................. $646 $265 $2,901 $89 (1) Had the Company consolidated these VIEs at December 31, 2003, the transition adjustments would have been $10 million, net of income tax. (2) The assets of the asset backed securitizations and collateralized debt obligations are reflected at fair value as of December 31, 2003. The assets of the real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships are reflected at the carrying amounts at which such assets would have been reflected on the Companys balance sheet had the Company consolidated the VIE from the date of its initial investment in the entity. 106 (3) The maximum exposure to loss of the asset backed securitizations and collateralized debt obligations is equal to the carrying amounts of retained interests. In addition, the Company provides collateral management services for certain of these structures for which it collects a management fee. The maximum exposure to loss relating to real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by amounts guaranteed by other partners. (4) Real estate joint ventures include partnerships and other ventures, which engage in the acquisition, development, management and disposal of real estate investments. (5) Other limited partnerships include partnerships established for the purpose of investing in public and private debt and equity securities, as well as limited partnerships established for the purpose of investing in low income housing that qualifies for federal tax credits. SECURITIES LENDING The Company participates in a securities lending program whereby blocks of securities, which are included in investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms. The Company requires a minimum of 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained as collateral for the loans. Securities with a cost or amortized cost of $25,121 million and $16,196 million and an estimated fair value of $26,387 million and $17,625 million were on loan under the program at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company was liable for cash collateral under its control of $27,083 million and $17,862 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Security collateral on deposit from customers may not be sold or repledged and is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS The Company manages each separate accounts assets in accordance with the prescribed investment policy that applies to that specific separate account. The Company establishes separate accounts on a single client and multi client commingled basis in conformity with insurance laws. Generally, separate accounts are not chargeable with liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account assets are subject to the Companys general account claims only to the extent that the value of such assets exceeds the separate account liabilities, as defined by the accounts contract. The Company reports separately as assets and liabilities investments held in separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts. The Company reports substantially all separate account assets at their fair market value. Investment income and gains or losses on the investments of separate accounts accrue directly to contractholders, and, accordingly, the Company does not reflect them in its consolidated statements of income and cash flows. The Company reflects in its revenues fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy administration fees, investment management fees and surrender charges. Effective January 1, 2004, in accordance with new accounting guidance, approximately $1,678 million of separate account assets will be transferred to investments with a corresponding transfer of separate account liabilities to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the market risk associated with its invested assets and interest rate sensitive insurance contracts. It has developed an integrated process for managing risk, which it conducts through its Corporate Risk Management Department, several asset/liability committees and additional specialists at the business segment level. The Company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility. 107 MARKET RISK EXPOSURES The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities. For purposes of this disclosure, "market risk" is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest rates. The Companys exposure to interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of fixed maturities, as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturities include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term treasury rates. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include guaranteed interest contracts and fixed annuities, which have the same interest rate exposure (medium and long term treasury rates) as the fixed maturities. The Company employs product design, pricing and asset/liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products. Asset/liability management strategies include the use of derivatives, the purchase of securities structured to protect against prepayments, prepayment restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent monitoring of the pricing of the Companys products in order to better match the duration of the assets and the liabilities they support. Equity prices. The Companys investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity prices. It manages this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through its asset/liability management strategies. The Company also manages equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. Foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from its holdings in non U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity securities and equity securities and through its investments in foreign subsidiaries. The principal currencies which create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the Companys investment portfolios are Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos, Chilean pesos and British pounds. The Company mitigates the majority of its fixed maturities foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of foreign currency swaps and forward contracts. Through its investments in foreign subsidiaries, the Company is primarily exposed to the Mexican peso and South Korean won. The Company has denominated substantially all assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies, thereby minimizing its risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. RISK MANAGEMENT Corporate risk management. MetLife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process. These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve asset/liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards. MetLife also has a separate Corporate Risk Management Department, which is responsible for risk throughout MetLife and reports to MetLifes Chief Financial Officer. The Corporate Risk Management Departments primary responsibilities consist of: implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework, which outlines the Companys approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis; developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring and monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk framework; establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels; deploying capital on an economic capital basis; and reporting on a periodic basis to the Governance Committee of the Holding Companys Board of Directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees. 108 Asset/liability management. At MetLife, asset/liability management is the responsibility of the General Account Portfolio Management Department ("GAPM"), the operating business segments and various GAPM boards. The GAPM boards are comprised of senior officers from the investment department, senior managers from each business segment and the Executive Vice President in charge of risk management at MetLife. The GAPM boards duties include setting broad asset/liability management policy and strategy, reviewing and approving target portfolios, establishing investment guidelines and limits, and providing oversight of the portfolio management process. The portfolio managers and asset sector specialists, who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities, implement the goals and objectives established by the GAPM boards. The goals of the investment process are to optimize after tax, risk adjusted investment income and after tax, risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The risk management objectives established by the GAPM boards stress quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity and investment return. Each of MetLifes business segments has an asset/liability officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment department to monitor investment, product pricing, hedge strategy and liability management issues. MetLife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product, which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. These strategies include objectives for effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality. To manage interest rate risk, the Company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements. These projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the Companys in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. The Company has developed models of its in force business that reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality and interest crediting rates. In addition, these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage prepayments and defaults. New York Insurance Department regulations require that MetLife perform some of these analyses annually as part of the annual proof of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves to meet adverse interest rate scenarios. Hedging activities. MetLifes risk management strategies incorporate the use of various interest rate derivatives that are used to adjust the overall duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities to reduce interest rate risk. Such instruments include financial futures, financial forwards, interest rate and credit default swaps, floors, options, written covered calls and caps. MetLife also uses foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments. Economic Capital. Beginning in 2003, the Company changed its methodology of allocating capital to its business segments from RBC to Economic Capital. Prior to 2003, the Companys business segments allocated equity was primarily based on RBC, an internally developed formula based on applying a multiple to the NAIC Statutory Risk Based Capital and includes certain GAAP accounting adjustments. Economic Capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The Economic Capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLifes businesses. This is in contrast to the standardized regulatory RBC formula, which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the Companys businesses. This change in methodology is being applied prospectively. This change has and will continue to impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the Companys business segments. A portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity. This change in methodology of allocating equity does not impact the Companys consolidated net investment income or net income. 109 RISK MEASUREMENT; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments, including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts ("other financial instruments"), based on changes in interest rates, equity prices and currency exchange rates, utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value, cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, equity prices and currency exchange rates. The Company believes that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term. In performing this analysis, the Company used market rates at December 31, 2003 to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of MetLifes market risk exposures (interest rate, equity price and foreign currency exchange rate) related to its non trading invested assets and other financial instruments. The Company does not maintain a trading portfolio. The sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above. The Company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets, earnings and cash flows as follows: Fair values. The Company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change (increase or decrease) in: the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates; the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of the Companys currency exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in currency exchange rates; and the market value of its equity positions due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity prices. Earnings and cash flows. MetLife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and equity prices. The following factors were incorporated into the earnings and cash flows sensitivity analyses: the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities; the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities; the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each 10% change (increase or decrease) in the interest rates; and the expected turnover (sales) of fixed maturities and equity securities, including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds. The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future financial performance. The Company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include: the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages; the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year. Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset/liability management personnel. Based on its analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and prices, MetLife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest 110 rate sensitive invested assets. The equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the Company to material market risk. The table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002. In addition, the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the Companys equity price sensitive positions at December 31, 2003 and 2002 is set forth in the table below. The potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the Companys portfolio, all of which is non trading, for the periods indicated was: DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Interest rate risk.......................................... $3,617 $2,710 Equity price risk........................................... $ 155 $ 120 Foreign currency exchange rate risk......................... $ 619 $ 529 The change in potential loss in fair value related to market risk exposure between December 31, 2003 and 2002 was primarily attributable to a shift in the yield curve. 111
