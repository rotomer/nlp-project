Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Item 1a. Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with those statements. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes to our audited financial statements. Our results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those in Risk Factors. Overview of Our Business We are a global leader in pediatric nutrition with approximately $2.9 billion in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. We are committed to creating trusted nutritional brands and products that help improve the health and development of infants and children around the world and provide them with the best start in life. Our Enfa family of brands, including Enfamil&reg; infant formula, is the worlds leading brand franchise in pediatric nutrition, based on retail sales. Our comprehensive product portfolio addresses a broad range of nutritional needs for infants, children and expectant and nursing mothers. We have over 100 years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or industry defining products across each of our product categories. We operate in four geographic regions: North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Due to similarities in the economics, products offered, production process, customer base and regulatory environment, these operating regions have been aggregated into two reportable segments: North America/Europe and Asia/Latin America. During 2008, our sales increased 11.9%, led by the Asia/Latin America segment where net sales increased by 23.8% compared with 2007. The Asia/Latin America segment now represents more than 50% of our global net sales and is characterized by broad based growth, a balanced portfolio of infant and childrens products and increasing investments in advertising and promotion. Our North America/Europe segment net sales increased by 1.1% over 2007, with an increase in Europe offset by a decline in the United States. 2008 performance in the United States has been affected by growth in private label products, due in part to the weakening economy, and the impact of WIC contract changes on our business. The global business experienced increases in dairy and other commodity costs in 2007 and 2008. Pricing actions have been implemented to compensate, although gross margin has declined as a percentage of sales. Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest in our two reportable operating segments grew by $88.7 million in 2008 driven by strong sales growth. Net earnings, however, were down $28.6 million in 2008 due to initial public offering costs and interest expense. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors: Industry Growth According to Euromonitor, the global pediatric nutrition industry has grown at a CAGR of approximately 11% from 2003 to 2008. We believe several trends have supported and will continue to support this growth, including the following: favorable demographics; increased consumer awareness of the importance of health and wellness; enhanced nutritional insight; innovation; and consumer willingness to pay for premium and enhanced nutrition products. 33 Table of Contents Perceptions of Product Quality and Safety We believe pediatric nutrition producers with a reputation for quality and safety should be able to command higher average selling prices and thereby generate higher gross margins than competitors who do not possess the same reputation. A decrease in the quality and safety of any particular product, whether real or perceived, could trigger wider negative perception of the decrease in the quality and safety of all producers, thereby affecting the industry generally. We believe our past growth has benefited from our brand recognition and from real and perceived safety and quality of our pediatric nutrition products. However, if a future market crisis involving any of our products should occur, especially if management fails to respond to such crisis in a timely and effective manner, our brand recognition and reputation could be severely damaged, which could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, melamine was found in Chinese dairy used in certain infant formula products of other manufacturers, which led to the deaths of several infants in September 2008. We do not use dairy or protein containing raw ingredients from China at any of our manufacturing sites and we have not been adversely impacted by these events in China thus far. Events such as these, however, may create a perception of contamination risk among consumers with respect to all products in our industry. Competition and Brand Recognition The pediatric nutrition industry is intensely competitive. Our principal competitors, including N&eacute;stle S.A., Abbott Laboratories, Groupe Danone and Wyeth, all have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, we face significant competition from domestic producers and private label, store and economy brand manufacturers. In recent years, there has been growing demand, particularly in Asia, for premium pediatric nutrition products due to increasing consumer awareness of brand image and nutritional value of the products offered by leading producers. Our success depends on sustaining the strength of our brands, particularly our Enfa family of brands. If we fail to promote and maintain the brand equity of our products, particularly our Enfa family of brands, across each of our markets, then consumer perception of its superior nutritional benefits may be diminished. If the difference in the value attributed to our products as compared to those of our competitors narrows, consumers may choose not to buy our products. In periods of economic uncertainty, these trends may be more pronounced. Raw Material Supply and Prices The per unit costs of producing our pediatric nutrition products are subject to the supply and price volatility of dairy and other raw materials, which are affected by global factors. For example, dairy prices are affected by factors such as geographic location, the impact of weather on dairy production, fluctuation in product availability, competition and inflation. Dairy costs are the largest component of our costs of products sold and our dairy costs have increased significantly over the past two years. Increases in the price of dairy would negatively impact our gross margins if we are not able to offset such increases through increases in our selling price, change in product mix or cost reduction/productivity enhancement efforts. The prices of these materials may continue to rise due to a general increase in commodities prices, especially for agricultural products. This would in turn affect the unit costs of products sold for our pediatric nutrition products. Foreign Exchange Movements We market our portfolio of products in more than 50 countries in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Due to the international aspect of our business, our net sales and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. This impact is reflected across our results of operations discussed below. 34 Table of Contents Our Growth Strategies We intend to grow our business profitably and enhance shareholder value by executing against the following strategic initiatives: Building on our leadership position in our core businesses; Continuing our leadership in product innovation; Expanding into selected high growth geographic markets and adjacent product categories; and Continuously improving upon our manufacturing and global supply chain excellence. Build on Our Leadership Position in Our Core Businesses We intend to grow our business in our core countries and product categories by building loyal usage of our brands, introducing innovative product that differentiate us in the marketplace and leveraging our expertise in marketing to consumers and health care professionals. In addition, we will continue to implement best practices and insights using our balance of local, regional and global capabilities to execute the most effective programs in all markets. We have a successful business model based on acquiring new consumers and retaining them. We also intend to invest in order to attract, retain and train talented employees who are committed to improving the health of the worlds infants and children and who have world class capabilities in key business disciplines including marketing, sales, product development, supply chain and finance. Continued Leadership in Innovation Innovation is fundamental to our long term growth and profitability. From 2003 to 2008, we have increased our investment in research and development (R&D) by 100% and established world class professional capabilities in our R&D headquarters and regional labs. Our R&D teams drive the integration of nutritional science with marketing across all phases of the product development process. We believe we have a strong innovation pipeline that is focused on improving the health and development of infants and children, with a particular focus on brain development, allergy and tolerance issues, immunity, healthy growth and improved product experience. Investments in leading systems and processes will be used to reduce cycle times for projects in our pipeline, and we are planning to achieve a systematic flow of innovations. We believe our global R&D capabilities, the strength of our brands and our ability to convert advances in nutritional science into marketable product innovations will continue to allow us to successfully develop new products and improve existing products across each of our product categories. Expansion into Selected High Growth Geographic Markets and Adjacent Product Categories Emerging markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East are projected to experience continued growth. We have established replicable business models and developed a deep understanding of business drivers in our core markets that we believe will lead to success in selected new high growth markets. We believe our global supply chain infrastructure, along with the strength of our business model and demand creation capabilities, strategically positions us for further expansion into certain high growth regions in which we currently have a more limited presence. In addition, there is a global trend of mothers seeking increased nutritional reassurance, and mothers and health care professionals alike associate the Mead Johnson name and the Enfa family of brands with the highest quality nutrition. We believe there are opportunities to extend our strong brand equities into select adjacent product categories through organic development, partnerships and acquisitions. Continuously Improve Upon Our Manufacturing and Global Supply Chain Excellence We seek to continuously improve the management and operation of our business by increasing efficiency in our operations at all stages of production, from sourcing of raw materials to manufacturing and distribution in local geographies. We maintained higher operating margins than those of our primary competitors in 2008, and we plan to continue to achieve incremental cost savings through broad based organizational involvement. 35 Table of Contents Components of Our Net Sales and Expenses Net Sales Our net sales are primarily derived from powdered milk formulated for infants and children sold to retailers and distributors. Net sales are driven by a combination of factors that include, but are not limited to: (1) the overall number of infants and children in the geographic and demographic markets in which we operate, (2) the innovation and competitiveness of our product offering, (3) governmental regulations and economic dynamics in our markets and (4) increased consumer awareness of the importance of health and wellness and enhanced nutritional insight. Our net sales include various adjustments including, gross to net sales adjustments for WIC rebates, cash discounts and sales returns. Our financial results include net sales of rebated WIC products which represented approximately 12% of total U.S. and Puerto Rico net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. The WIC program is a U.S. Department of Agriculture program created to provide nutritious foods, nutrition education and referrals to health care professionals and other social services to those considered to be at nutritional risk, including low income pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women and infants and children up to age five. It is estimated that approximately 51% of all infants born in the United States and Puerto Rico during the 12 month period ending December 31, 2008 benefited from the WIC program. Participation in the WIC program is an important part of our U.S. business based on the volume of infant formula sold under the program. Sales to WIC participants are primarily transacted through the retail network at full retail price. Rebates to the state WIC agencies are payable based on the number of eligible retail purchases by WIC participants, vouchers issued and the terms of the WIC contracts. Expenses Our expenses are made up of the following components: Costs of products sold consist primarily of costs of materials that we use in the manufacture of our products. Historically, the cost of materials has represented a majority of our total costs of products sold. Our materials costs are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices, principally dairy, agricultural oils and tinplate. Plant conversion costs including labor and overhead make up most of the remainder of costs of products sold. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits, corporate and shared service allocations, occupancy, third party selling, marketing and market research services. These expenses also include distribution expenses, which are primarily comprised of warehousing and freight costs. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are driven by business strategy and inflation. Advertising and product promotion expenses consist primarily of expenses related to media, samples, medical education and direct to consumer programs. Advertising and product promotion expenses are driven by marketing strategy and inflation. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits, clinical studies and product development costs. Research and development expenses are driven by business strategy and the level of innovation and support for our products. Other expenses, net, consist primarily of income or loss from a third party manufacturing contract that is non core to our pediatric nutrition business, gains and losses from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, the impact of certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous expenses. BMS currently provides us with significant corporate and shared services functions. Our historical financial statements for all periods in this report reflect an allocation of these costs primarily within marketing, selling and administrative expenses. These allocations include costs related to corporate and shared services functions such as executive oversight, risk management, information technology, accounting, audit, legal, investor relations, human resources, tax, treasury, procurement, pensions and post retirement, stock based compensation and other services. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 11.9 % Expenses 2,186.7 1,913.2 14.3 % 75.9 % 74.3 % Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest 695.7 663.2 4.9 % 24.1 % 25.7 % Interest Expense (43.3 ) 1.5 % Provision for Income Taxes (251.4 ) (233.6 ) 7.6 % 8.7 % 9.1 % Effective Tax Rate 38.5 % 35.2 % Minority Interest Expense net of tax (7.1 ) (7.1 ) 0.0 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Net Earnings $ 393.9 $ 422.5 (6.8 %) 13.7 % 16.4 % Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $306.0 million, or 11.9%, to $2,882.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The percentage change in sales was driven by price increase of 8.5% and volume growth of 1.5%, and included a 1.9% positive foreign exchange impact. Net sales increased throughout Asia, Latin America and Europe offset by a slight decline in the United States. Net sales increased in all product categories, driven by pricing increases in response to increased dairy costs, the impact of increased advertising and promotion, regional expansion within key Asian markets, most notably China, and product innovation. Innovations launched in the period include the addition of prebiotics and an increase in the level of DHA in several of our products in Asia. Additionally, in North America, we launched Nutramigen AA&reg;, an amino acid based infant formula for infants with severe food allergies. The decline in the U.S. business was attributable to growth in private label products, due in part to the weakening economy, and the impact of WIC contract changes on our business. We operate in two reportable segments: Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Our net sales based on those segments are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change % Change Due toForeign Exchange Asia/Latin America $ 1,516.9 $ 1,225.2 23.8 % 3.2 % North America/Europe 1,365.5 1,351.2 1.1 % 0.8 % Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 11.9 % 1.9 % Our Asia/Latin America segment represented 52.6% of net sales and our North America/Europe segment represented 47.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Asia/Latin America sales increased $291.7 million, or 23.8%, including a positive 3.2% foreign currency exchange impact, to $1,516.9 million in 2008. Growth in Asia/Latin America was broad based across all major markets driven by pricing increases and strong volume growth in China and Hong Kong. The net sales growth is underpinned by higher advertising and promotion supporting new product launches including the addition of prebiotics and the increase in the level of DHA in some childrens nutrition products in Asia. In addition, we experienced a temporary increase in demand for our products in China due to the withdrawal of certain infant formula products of other manufacturers due to the presence of melamine in certain dairy materials sourced in country. We do not use dairy or protein containing raw ingredients from China in our products. 37 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2008, North America/Europe sales increased $14.3 million, or 1.1%, including a positive 0.8% foreign currency exchange impact, to $1,365.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was due primarily to pricing increases offset by U.S. volume losses attributable to growth in private label products, due in part to the weakening economy, and the impact of WIC contract changes on our business. We have three product categories: (1) infant formula, (2) childrens nutrition and (3) other. Our net sales based on those product categories are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change % Change Due toForeign Exchange Infant Formula $ 1,931.6 $ 1,788.1 8.0 % 1.5 % Childrens Nutrition 855.9 696.5 22.9 % 3.0 % Other 94.9 91.8 3.4 % 2.5 % Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 11.9 % 1.9 % Net sales for the period increased in each of our product categories. For the year ended December 31, 2008, infant formula sales increased $143.5 million, or 8.0%, including a positive 1.5% foreign currency exchange impact, to $1,931.6 million compared to 2007. Growth in the sales of infant formula, which is sold in all regions, reflects a mix of the higher growth in the Asia/Latin America segment and the lower growth in the North America/Europe segment. Childrens nutrition products, sold primarily in the Asia/Latin America segment, increased $159.4 million, or 22.9%, including a positive 3.0% foreign currency exchange impact, to $855.9 million in 2008, in line with the broad based growth across our key Asia and Latin America markets. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales was as follows: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change Gross Sales $ 3,974.2 $ 3,717.2 6.9 % Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates (796.0 ) (847.8 ) (6.1 %) Sales Discounts (87.9 ) (66.3 ) 32.6 % Returns (64.7 ) (67.6 ) (4.3 %) Cash Discounts (46.9 ) (48.0 ) (2.3 %) Prime Vendor Charge Backs (42.2 ) (47.5 ) (11.2 %) Other Adjustments (54.1 ) (63.6 ) (14.9 %) Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments (1,091.8 ) (1,140.8 ) (4.3 %) Total Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 11.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2008, our gross sales increased $257.0 million, or 6.9 %, to $3,974.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross to net sales adjustments during the same period declined $49.0 million, or 4.3%, to $1,091.8 million. The decline was generated by changes in WIC rebates in North America due to the loss of the Western States Contracting Alliance, Texas, Minnesota and Iowa WIC contracts to other infant formula manufacturers during the fourth quarter of 2007, partially offset by the gain of California and Louisiana WIC contracts during the second half of 2007, as well as the gain of Illinois and Colorado WIC contracts during the first quarter of 2008. Sales discounts increased $21.6 million during the same period primarily in key Asia markets due to revenue growth and a change in retail sales mix to key customers with higher discounts. Other adjustments include coupons, contract discounts and various rebates. The decrease in other adjustments was driven primarily by a decline in consumer coupons. 38 Table of Contents Expenses Year Ended December 31, % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 Expenses: Costs of Products Sold $ 1,079.8 $ 948.7 13.8 % 37.5 % 36.8 % Marketing, Selling and Administrative 651.7 575.2 13.3 % 22.6 % 22.3 % Advertising and Product Promotion 369.3 318.5 15.9 % 12.8 % 12.4 % Research and Development 72.8 67.2 8.3 % 2.5 % 2.6 % Other Expenses net 13.1 3.6 0.5 % 0.1 % Total Expenses $ 2,186.7 $ 1,913.2 14.3 % 75.9 % 74.3 % Costs of Products Sold For the year ended December 31, 2008, costs of products sold increased $131.1 million, or 13.8%, to $1,079.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was driven primarily by global material price increases. In 2007, the market volatility in material prices was mitigated partially through the contractual pricing agreements we entered into during 2006 and prior periods. However, many of these contracts expired in late 2007, resulting in an increase in our costs of products sold in 2008. Additionally, the costs of products sold increase was driven by sales volume growth and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Furthermore, the cost increase as a percentage of sales was also driven by product mix changes as lower margin childrens nutrition products experienced more rapid volume gains than higher margin infant formulas. Marketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2008, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased $76.5 million, or 13.3%, to $651.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of this increase was due to $41.8 million of non recurring costs related to our initial public offering and $19.3 million of higher corporate and shared service expense allocations. The marketing, selling and administrative expense increase was also driven by additional marketing efforts in Asia, including sales force expansion in China, and global salary and benefits increases due to inflation. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar also drove an increase in expense. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of a $17.6 million bad debt expense in the first half of 2007 related to a distributors insolvency in Asia. Advertising and Product Promotion Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2008, advertising and product promotion expenses increased $50.8 million, or 15.9%, to $369.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was driven in large part by a strategic decision to increase various demand generating activities in key Asian markets, investment in promotional programs in Mexico and by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Research and Development Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2008, research and development expenses increased $5.6 million, or 8.3%, to $72.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was driven mainly by increased investment in clinical and discovery trials, salary and benefits inflation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. 39 Table of Contents Other Expense net For the year ended December 31, 2008, other expense net increased $9.5 million, to $13.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was driven by the losses in 2008 on our supply agreement for our former Adult Nutrition business, which was divested in 2004, and a non recurring gain on the 2007 divestiture of Cafcit, a pediatric pharmaceutical product. Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest Our Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest (EBITMI) are from our two reportable segments, North America/Europe and Asia/Latin America, reduced by Corporate and Other costs. Corporate and Other costs consist of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses, including in part, executive, legal, finance, information technology, human resources, research and development, global marketing and global supply chain costs. Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change Total Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest $ 695.7 $ 663.2 4.9 % Asia/Latin America 462.9 363.9 27.2 % North America/Europe 467.3 477.6 (2.2 %) Corporate and Other (234.5 ) (178.3 ) 31.5 % For the year ended December 31, 2008, Asia/Latin America EBITMI increased $99.0 million, or 27.2%, to $462.9 million. This increase was primarily driven by growth in sales and the absence of $17.6 million bad debt expense in 2007 related to a distributors insolvency, partly offset by increases in material costs. During the same period, North America/Europe EBITMI decreased $10.3 million, or 2.2%, to $467.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, driven by sales declines in the United States and increases in material costs. During the same period, Corporate and Other costs increased $56.2 million, or 31.5%, to $234.5 million. This was principally due to $44.8 million in expenses related to our initial public offering and an increase in corporate and shared service expense allocations from $90.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, to $112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased from 35.2% to 38.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by the capitalization in 2008 of certain initial public offering expenses for tax purposes, the benefit of certain basis differences reflected in the 2007 effective tax rate and changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction. Interest Expense Interest expense represents interest incurred on the $2,000.0 million note payable issued in August 2008. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Related Parties and Note 21. Subsequent Events. Minority Interest Expense Minority interest expenses net of taxes consist almost entirely of an 11% minority interest in our joint venture in China. Net Earnings For the foregoing reasons, for the year ended December 31, 2008, net earnings decreased $28.6 million, or 6.8%, to $393.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. 40 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 Net Sales $ 2,576.4 $ 2,345.1 9.9 % Expenses 1,913.2 1,710.3 11.9 % 74.3 % 72.9 % Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest 663.2 634.8 4.5 % 25.7 % 27.1 % Provision for Income Taxes (233.6 ) (230.1 ) 1.5 % 9.1 % 9.8 % Effective Tax Rate 35.2 % 36.2 % Minority Interest Expense net of tax (7.1 ) (6.5 ) 9.2 % 0.3 % 0.3 % Net Earnings $ 422.5 $ 398.2 6.1 % 16.4 % 17.0 % Net Sales For the year ended December 31, 2007, global net sales increased $231.3 million to $2,576.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The percentage change in sales was driven by price of 3.4% and volume growth of 3.2%, and included a 3.3% positive foreign exchange impact. The business grew in all regions and all product categories, with strong broad based growth across our key Asia markets. Net sales based on our segments are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change % Change Due toForeign Exchange Asia/Latin America $ 1,225.2 $ 1,054.6 16.2 % 5.7 % North America/Europe 1,351.2 1,290.5 4.7 % 1.3 % Net Sales $ 2,576.4 $ 2,345.1 9.9 % 3.3 % Our Asia/Latin America segment represented 47.6% of net sales and our North America/Europe segment represented 52.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. Asia/Latin America sales increased $170.6 million, or 16.2%, including a favorable 5.7% foreign currency exchange impact, to $1,225.2 million. Growth was broad based with the top Asian markets all showing double digit increases in net sales. During the same period, North America/Europe net sales increased $60.7 million, or 4.7%, including a positive 1.3% foreign currency exchange impact, to $1,351.2 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales growth was driven in the United States by a third quarter price increase and additional WIC sales from the new California contract, which was offset partially by the Texas and the Western States Contracting Alliance contract losses and by the loss of regulatory exclusivity for Cafcit, a pediatric pharmaceutical product since divested. Net sales based on our product categories are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change % Change Due toForeign Exchange Infant Formula $ 1,788.1 $ 1,634.8 9.4 % 2.4 % Childrens Nutrition 696.5 603.8 15.4 % 5.6 % Other 91.8 106.5 (13.8 )% 3.7 % Net Sales $ 2,576.4 $ 2,345.1 9.9 % 3.3 % 41 Table of Contents Net sales for the period increased in the infant formula and childrens nutrition product categories. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the infant formula business increased $153.3 million, or 9.4%, including a favorable 2.4% foreign currency impact, to $1,788.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. We maintained a strong position in infant formula products sold in the United States, with 5.0% growth in net sales. Childrens nutrition products, which are almost entirely sold in the Asia/Latin America segment, increased $92.7 million, or 15.4%, including a favorable 5.6% foreign currency exchange impact, to $696.5 million during the same period, primarily due to broad based growth across our key Asian markets. The decrease in other sales was due mainly to a $17 million decline in net sales of Cafcit, a pediatric pharmaceutical product, due to the loss of regulatory exclusivity in the fourth quarter of 2006 and its divestment in the fourth quarter of 2007. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales was as follows: Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change Gross Sales $ 3,717.2 $ 3,480.1 6.8 % Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates (847.8 ) (871.9 ) (2.8 )% Sales Discounts (66.3 ) (55.0 ) 20.5 % Returns (67.6 ) (65.2 ) 3.7 % Cash Discounts (48.0 ) (47.9 ) 0.2 % Prime Vendor Charge Backs (47.5 ) (46.7 ) 1.7 % Other Adjustments (63.6 ) (48.3 ) 31.7 % Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments (1,140.8 ) (1,135.0 ) 0.5 % Total Net Sales $ 2,576.4 $ 2,345.1 9.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2007, our gross sales increased $237.1 million, or 6.8%, to $3,717.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross to net sales adjustments during the same period increased $5.8 million, or 0.5%, to $1,140.8 million. This decline was largely the result of changes in WIC rebates in North America due to the loss of Georgia and the New England and Tribal Organization WIC contracts to other infant formula manufacturers in the fourth quarter of 2006, as well as the Western States Contracting Alliance, Texas, Minnesota and Iowa WIC contracts during the fourth quarter of 2007. These declines were partially offset by the addition of the Michigan WIC contract during the fourth quarter of 2006, as well as California and Louisiana WIC contracts during the second half of 2007. In addition, sales discounts increased $6.5 million during the same period in key Asian markets due to a change in retail sales mix resulting in increased gross sales to key customers with higher discounts and a $5.1 million increase from a distributor model change. Other adjustments include coupons, contract discounts and various rebates. The increase in other adjustments was driven primarily by an increase in consumer coupons. Expenses Year Ended December 31, % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 Expenses: Costs of Products Sold $ 948.7 $ 850.4 11.6 % 36.8 % 36.3 % Marketing, Selling and Administrative 575.2 504.3 14.1 % 22.3 % 21.5 % Advertising and Product Promotion 318.5 290.6 9.6 % 12.4 % 12.4 % Research and Development 67.2 62.0 8.4 % 2.6 % 2.6 % Other Expenses net 3.6 3.0 20.0 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Total Expenses $ 1,913.2 $ 1,710.3 11.9 % 74.3 % 72.9 % 42 Table of Contents Costs of Products Sold For the year ended December 31, 2007, costs of products sold increased $98.3 million, or 11.6%, to $948.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was driven by sales volume growth, dairy price increases and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Furthermore, the cost increase as a percentage of sales was driven by product mix changes as childrens nutrition products carry a higher cost of products sold on a percentage of sales basis as compared to infant formula. Marketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2007, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased $70.9 million, or 14.1%, to $575.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was driven by a $17.6 million bad debt expense related to a distributor insolvency, increased corporate and shared service expense allocations of $11.7 million from BMS, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies and global salary and benefits inflationary increases. The increase in corporate allocations included costs related to information management and corporate insurance. Advertising and Product Promotion Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2007, advertising and product promotion expenses increased $27.9 million, or 9.6%, to $318.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was driven by strategic decisions regarding investment to support sales growth. Research and Development Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2007, research and development expenses increased $5.2 million, or 8.4%, to $67.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The rate of increase reflected the full year staffing impact of the regional development centers in Asia and Latin America. Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change Total Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interest $ 663.2 $ 634.8 4.5 % Asia/Latin America 363.9 335.9 8.3 % North America/Europe 477.6 460.3 3.8 % Corporate and Other (178.3 ) (161.4 ) 10.5 % For the year ended December 31, 2007, Asia/Latin America EBITMI increased $28.0 million, or 8.3%, to $363.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in EBITMI for the Asia/Latin America segment was primarily driven by a 16.2% increase in net sales during the same period, partially offset by a bad debt expense of $17.6 million related to a distributors insolvency. For the same period, North America/Europe EBITMI increased $17.3 million, or 3.8%, to $477.6 million compared to the prior year. The increase in EBITMI for North America/Europe was primarily driven by a 4.7% increase in net sales during the same period. For the same period, Corporate and Other costs increased $16.9 million, or 10.5%, to $178.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This was due to an increase in corporate insurance and information management expenses allocated from BMS. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased to 35.2% from 36.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This reduction in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by the benefit of certain basis differences. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our provision for income taxes increased $3.5 million, or 1.5%, to $233.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, due to higher pre tax earnings. 43 Table of Contents Net Earnings For the foregoing reasons, for the year ended December 31, 2007, net earnings increased $24.3 million, or 6.1%, to $422.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and available borrowings under our $410.0 million revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our customers and the outflow of our cash for inventory purchases, operating expenses and taxes. Cash flows used in investing activities primarily represent capital expenditure for equipment, buildings and computer software. Cash flows used in financing activities historically have represented the transfer of cash to BMS. As an operating division, we have not reported cash or cash equivalents on our balance sheet for the periods presented. Historically, BMS has managed the treasury relationships for receiving and disbursing cash to cover all cash flow activity from operations and investing activities. In the future, we believe that cash from operations will be sufficient to support our working capital needs, pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt obligations, fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments. In addition, we will have $410.0 million available to us under our revolving credit facility. Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating Activities $ 477.3 $ 472.1 $ 351.8 Investing Activities (79.4 ) (74.2 ) (63.0 ) Financing Activities (397.9 ) (397.9 ) (288.8 ) Net change in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ $ $ Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $5.2 million to $477.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was due to a reduction in working capital in 2008 as compared to an increase in 2007, offset by a decline in net earnings of $28.6 million which was driven by initial public offering expenses and interest costs. The favorable change in working capital is due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash used in investing activities increased $5.2 million to $79.4 million for the same period, due to an increase in capital expenditures and a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of equipment and a trademark. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $120.3 million to $472.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was driven by a $24.3 million increase in net earnings and an increase of $68.8 million due to a reduced build in working capital in 2007 as compared to 2006. The favorable working capital change is due to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to increased commodity costs and salary and benefit accruals. Net cash used in investing activities increased $11.2 million to $74.2 million for the same period, primarily related to quality and capacity investments at our production facilities and an increase in capitalized software to support formulation management and web based sales capabilities. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures increased $2.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, which is consistent with historical growth rates. We expect our 44 Table of Contents capital expenditures to increase significantly in 2009 to support manufacturing and research and development capabilities as well as global software and hardware purchases. Capital expenditures in 2009 will include the expansion of our Research and Development Technology Center. Debt On August 26, 2008, we declared and issued a dividend in the form of a note in an amount of $2,000.0 million bearing an annual interest rate of 6.1% to BMS. On February 17, 2009, we restructured this note into three senior unsecured notes of $744.2 million, $500.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. The first note, in the amount of $744.2 million, matures in February 2014 and bears interest at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.0%, payable quarterly. Starting June 1, 2010 and continuing through December 31, 2013, we will make quarterly principal payments of $18.8 million. The second note, in the amount of $500.0 million, matures in February 2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 6.43%, payable semiannually. This note is not subject to amortization payments. The third note, in the amount of $500.0 million matures in February 2019 and bears interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 6.91%, payable semiannually. This note is not subject to amortization payments. In addition, we and BMS agreed that our opening cash balance at the date of the initial public offering of our stock would be $250.0 million to meet our operating requirements. The resulting debt on our balance sheet at the time of the offering was $1,750.0 million, excluding our capital lease obligations and including $5.8 million of debt in our international subsidiaries. We believe that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our $410.0 million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for further discussion. Revolving Credit Facility Agreement On February 17, 2009, we entered into a three year syndicated revolving credit facility agreement (Credit Facility). The Credit Facility is unsecured and repayable on maturity in February 2012, subject to annual extensions if sufficient lenders agree. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit permitted at any one time under the facility agreement is $410.0 million, which amount may be increased from time to time up to $500.0 million at our request, subject to customary conditions contained in the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest either at (a) LIBOR for specified interest periods plus a margin determined with reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a floating rate based upon JPMorgan Chase Banks prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR plus, in each case, a margin determined with reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. The margin on the borrowings can range from 1.125% to 2.65% over the applicable base. Our subsidiaries may become borrowers under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants applicable to us limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The Credit Facility also contains the following financial covenants: We are required to maintain a ratio of (a) consolidated total debt to (b) consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.0. Compliance with this covenant is tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter and as a condition precedent to each credit extension under the Credit Facility We are required to maintain a ratio of (i) consolidated EBITDA to (ii) consolidated interest expense of at least 3.00 to 1.00. Compliance with this covenant is tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 45 Table of Contents In addition, the Credit Facility has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control, ERISA matters and cross default to other debt agreements. 2009 Operational Changes The results of operations during 2009 will reflect several adjustments related to our separation from BMS, as described below. Operating model changes Delays in establishing new operating subsidiaries Increases in stand alone public company costs Separation costs associated with the initial public offering Interest expense In addition to these items that impact 2009 results of operations, there will be several adjustments to the balance sheet related to our separation from BMS. These include the recognition of a pension liability, inclusion of cash balances and restructuring of related party debt and divisional equity. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Subsequent Events. Operating Model Changes In Europe, we will transition from using BMS to distribute our products to a third party distributor model. This will have the effect of reducing our net sales by the amount of the distributors margin and lowering costs for distribution related expenses that historically have been recorded in our marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Had this model been in effect during 2008, we estimate that sales and EBITMI would have been reduced by approximately $8.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively. In Mexico, we will operate our business through a newly formed operating subsidiary. Had this model been in effect during 2008, we estimate that employee profit sharing within the MJN operating subsidiary would have increased expenses by approximately $3.0 million. Furthermore, a BMS subsidiary will lease to our Mexico operating subsidiary all of the property, plant and equipment at our manufacturing facility in Delicias under a 20 year lease that will be treated as a capital lease. This will result in an increase in Interest Expense and Other Liabilities related to the lease payments. Delays in Establishing New Operating Subsidiaries In Brazil, our ability to operate a new stand alone subsidiary will be delayed for a period of time due to certain statutory and regulatory requirements for permits and applications. Until we are able to operate as a stand alone entity in Brazil, BMS will distribute and record sales for our products. We will conduct marketing activities and record service revenue equal to our marketing costs plus a markup. Had this model been in effect during 2008, we estimate that our sales would have been reduced by approximately $28.0 million with a minimal impact to EBITMI. Stand alone Public Company Costs MJN results historically have included corporate and shared service cost allocations from BMS. As a stand alone company, we will build these capabilities through a combination of transition services agreements and transferred and incremental costs. We will incur additional costs for financial reporting and compliance, corporate governance, treasury and investor relations activities. We estimate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in 2009 by approximately $30.0 million to $36.0 million, including service charges by BMS and expenses for services not included in the transition service agreements. 46 Table of Contents Separation Costs We have incurred in 2008 and expect to incur in 2009, separation costs in connection with the initial public offering, including costs related to legal, accounting, systems implementation and consulting services. Our 2008 results include separation costs of $44.8 million, and we expect these costs to be approximately $29.0 million to $35.0 million in 2009. Interest Expense On August 26, 2008, we issued a $2,000.0 million intercompany note to BMS and incurred interest expense of $43.3 million in 2008. In 2009, we will incur a full year of interest expense on the restructured notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Related Parties and Note 21. Subsequent Events. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of December 31, 2008, our significant contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows: Payments due by December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Operating Lease Obligations $ 14.6 $ 7.7 $ 6.1 $ 5.5 $ 5.4 $ 25.8 $ 65.1 Capital Lease Obligations 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 1.4 Purchase Obligations 29.2 25.5 23.1 12.5 6.9 52.2 149.4 Related Party Debt* 2,043.3 2,043.3 Total $ 2,087.3 $ 33.4 $ 29.4 $ 18.2 $ 12.5 $ 78.4 $ 2,259.2 * Amount represents the $2,000.0 million note payable to BMS and related interest. This note is classified as noncurrent on our balance sheet as it was amended and restructured on February 17, 2009, into three notes, which are payable in more than one year, and a portion of which was forgiven. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Subsequent Events. Our operating lease obligations are generally related to real estate leases for manufacturing assets or offices and vehicle leases. Capital lease obligations relate to assets utilized for interplant transportation of materials and finished goods. Purchase obligations are generally for unconditional commitments related to the purchase of materials used in manufacturing and for promotional services. The table above does not include $17.9 million in uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of those positions. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Subsequent Events for discussion of various agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2008. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently use off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge or partially hedge interest rate exposure nor do we currently maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions or other financial or investment purposes. Critical Accounting Policies In presenting our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on 47 Table of Contents various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. For further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation Our financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of BMS, principally from statements and records representing the Mead Johnson Nutrition business. The statements of earnings also include corporate and shared service expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to us by BMS, including general corporate expenses such as executive oversight, risk management, information technology, accounting, audit, legal, investor relations, human resources, tax and other services. These allocations were based on specific identification or the percentage of our revenues and headcount to the respective total BMS revenues and headcount. These allocations are reflected in the statements of earnings, primarily within marketing, selling and administrative, and totaled $112.1 million, $90.1 million, and $80.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Allocation costs in prior years have been revised from previously disclosed amounts. The disclosure now excludes information management costs dedicated to MJN and includes stock based compensation and pension costs. This change in disclosure had no impact on amounts presented in the financial statements. We consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense we would have incurred as a stand alone company. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand alone company in 2008, 2007 and 2006 would depend on a number of factors, including our chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by our employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology systems and infrastructure. BMS has not allocated debt or external debt interest cost to us because none of the debt recorded by BMS is directly related to our business, which is self funding. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser. Revenues are reduced at the time of recognition to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience and business trends. Additionally, provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for discounts, WIC rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We offer sales incentives to customers and consumers through various programs consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons. The cost of these programs is recognized as incurred and recorded as a reduction of revenue. WIC rebate accruals were $194.7 million and $197.6 million at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which are included in accrued rebates and returns. We participate on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, we reimburse these entities for the difference between our wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. We account for WIC contract rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the WIC 48 Table of Contents rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. We consider levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts and WIC participation, and adjust the accrual quarterly to reflect actual expense. Rebates under the WIC program reduced revenues by $796.0 million, $847.8 million, and $871.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales return accruals were $29.3 million and $30.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are included in accrued rebates and returns. We account for sales returns in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. We determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns. Returns reduced sales by $64.7 million, $67.6 million and $65.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income Taxes During the periods presented, we did not file separate tax returns, as we were included in the tax grouping of other BMS entities within the respective entitys tax jurisdiction. The income tax provision included in the financial statements was calculated using the separate return basis, as if we were a separate stand alone taxpayer. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. With the exception of Mead Johnson dedicated entities, we do not maintain taxes payable to or from BMS and are deemed to settle the annual current tax balances immediately with the tax paying legal entities in their respective jurisdictions. These settlements are reflected as changes in divisional equity. We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation Number (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, we derecognized $4.8 million of previously recognized tax benefits, which were accounted for as a decrease to the opening balance of divisional equity. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. An 49 Table of Contents estimate of the assets fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. Asset impairment or accelerated depreciation resulting from an assessment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, is recorded as costs of products sold. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process on an annual basis or when current facts or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. We complete our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the first quarter and monitor for any potential impairment in the remaining quarters, neither of which indicated an impairment of goodwill in 2008, 2007 or 2006. Other intangible assets, consisting of a trademark and computer software, are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives, ranging from 3 to 7.5 years. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment as described in Impairment of Long Lived Assets above. Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, product and or environmental, health, and safety liabilities, and tax matters. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we record accruals for such loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We, in accordance with SFAS No. 5, do not recognize gain contingencies until realized. For a discussion of contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities carried at fair value. This pronouncement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On November 14, 2007, the FASB agreed to a one year deferral for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for other non financial assets and liabilities. Our adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on our financial statements for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities carried at fair value. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement for other non financial assets or liabilities. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. This FASB also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary must be accounted for consistently, and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value. This FASB statement also requires 50 Table of Contents entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This FASB is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as an amendment to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 161 requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. The fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses will need to be presented in tabular format in order to present a more complete picture of the effects of using derivative instruments. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. For additional discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 8. Financial Statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Inflation The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. Our materials costs are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices, principally dairy, agricultural oils and tinplate. In addition, costs for construction, taxes, repairs, maintenance, insurance and media are all subject to inflationary pressures. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso, the Philippine peso, the Hong Kong dollar and the Euro. Historically, we have used derivative financial instruments indirectly through participation in the centralized hedging functions of BMS, which are designed primarily to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk. In the future, we expect to use derivative financial instruments consistent with past use. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings. The foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of $0.9 million, $2.6 million, and $5.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on our earnings was not material. We plan to enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available. Derivative financial instruments will not be used for speculative purposes. The intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. While we intend to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments. 51 Table of Contents Commodity Risk We purchase certain products in the normal course of business, including dairy and agricultural oils, the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes. Therefore, we are exposed to some price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility. Generally these techniques include setting fixed prices with suppliers, such as unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time. We do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, partly because of these contract pricing techniques. 52 Table of Contents
