Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with those statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes to our audited financial statements. Our results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those in Risk Factors. Overview of Our Business We are a global leader in pediatric nutrition. We are committed to creating trusted nutritional brands and products that help improve the health and development of infants and children around the world and provide them with the best start in life. Our comprehensive product portfolio addresses a broad range of nutritional needs for infants, children and expectant and nursing mothers. We have over 100 years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or industry defining products across each of our product categories. We operate in four geographic regions: Asia, Latin America, North America and Europe. Due to similarities in the economics, products offered, production process, customer base and regulatory environment, these operating regions have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Executive Summary In 2009, Mead Johnson Nutrition Company went from being a wholly owned division of Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS) to a separately traded, independent public company. In February 2009, we issued 34.5 million shares of our common stock in an initial public offering (IPO) resulting in 204.5 million shares of common stock outstanding, of which 170.0 million was owned by BMS. On December 23, 2009, BMS disposed of its entire ownership interest in us through an exchange offer with its shareholders. All of our common stock is now publicly held. In November 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of notes through a private placement and used the net proceeds, along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash, to repay our debt obligations to BMS totaling $1.7 billion. Our operating results are driven by a number of factors including, pediatric nutrition industry growth; favorable demographic trends, especially in emerging markets; economic and other factors affecting the number of babies born each year; our ability to hold or gain market share and to sustain the strength of our brand franchise; the success of new product innovations; the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; growth through geographic expansion; the success of our on going productivity efforts; changes in the cost of raw materials and other commodities, principally dairy; our ability to increase prices; and foreign exchange rate movements. During 2009, we reported strong growth in our Asia and Latin America markets, resulting in share gains in many countries within that segment. We continued to invest in high growth markets in Asia and Latin America, particularly in China, by adding to our sales force as we expand into new cities and by supporting those efforts through product innovation and increased investments in advertising and promotion. The U.S. market contracted in 2009 due to fewer births and our U.S. business also lost market share. We have begun to see our U.S. business stabilize, benefitting from the success of new products launched in 2009, backed by increased investments in marketing, advertising and promotion. During 2009, we benefited from lower commodity costs; however, dairy prices started increasing toward the end of the year, which we expect to adversely affect our gross profits in 2010. During 2009, we also initiated a global infrastructure redesign project. We expect to transition, replace or retire the information technology systems, administration and outsourced services provided to us by BMS, via transition services agreements. Once this multi year project is complete and we have fully separated from BMS information technology and shared service functions, we believe our cost structure will be more efficient. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: % of Net Sales (In millions, except per share data) 2009 2008 % Change 2009 2008 Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2 %) Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 679.6 695.7 (2 %) 24 % 24 % Interest Expense net (92.6 ) (43.3 ) 114 % 3 % 2 % Earnings before Income Taxes 587.0 652.4 (10 %) 21 % 23 % Provision for Income Taxes (176.4 ) (251.4 ) (30 %) 6 % 9 % Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 30.1 % 38.5 % Net Earnings 410.6 401.0 2 % 15 % 14 % Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (11.0 ) (7.1 ) 55 % 0 % 0 % Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 399.6 393.9 1 % 14 % 14 % Weighted Average Common Shares Diluted 200.7 170.0 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 1.99 $ 2.32 (14 %) Factors Affecting Comparability The results for the year ended December 31, 2009, include several items that affect the comparability of the companys financial results between 2009 and 2008. These items include significant expenses not indicative of on going results, interest expense, operating model changes, the ETR and the number of shares outstanding. In 2009 we incurred $81.1 million of expense for significant items not indicative of on going results including IPO related costs, IT separation costs, gain on asset sale, severance and relocation costs and legal costs and settlements. In 2008 we incurred $44.8 million in IPO related costs. Interest expense increased $49.3 million in 2009 due to the addition of debt to our capital structure beginning in the third quarter of 2008. On August 26, 2008, we issued a $2.0 billion intercompany note to BMS. The note was restructured at the IPO date reducing the related party debt to approximately $1.7 billion. In November 2009, we repaid these notes to BMS in full through the net proceeds from the private placement of three tranches of notes, totaling $1.5 billion, along with borrowings under our three year syndicated credit facility agreement (Credit Facility) and cash on hand. Net interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2009, was $92.6 million compared with $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our 2009 results include operating model changes primarily in Brazil and Europe. In Brazil, our ability to operate as a new stand alone subsidiary was delayed from February to late in September 2009. During that time, BMS distributed and recorded sales for our products and we conducted marketing activities. In Europe, we have transitioned to a third party distributor model with BMS temporarily serving as our distributor. This reduced net sales by the amount of the distributors margin and lowered costs for the distribution related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the ETR was 30.1% compared to 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The lower rate was driven primarily by our new legal entity structure to facilitate the IPO, one time restructuring benefits, and earnings mix. Prior to February 10, 2009, there were 170.0 million shares of common stock outstanding. We issued an additional 34.5 million shares of common stock in the IPO. On November 15, 2009, BMS announced an exchange offer whereby BMS shareholders could exchange a portion of BMS common stock for our stock. Prior to the completion of the exchange offer, BMS converted all its MJN Class B common stock into MJN Class A 38 Table of Contents common stock. The exchange offer was completed on December 23, 2009, resulting in the split off of MJN from BMS, after which BMS had no equity or voting interest in us. In addition to these items that affect the comparability of the 2009 results of operations to 2008, there are several adjustments to the balance sheet related to our separation from BMS including the recognition of pension, inclusion of cash balances and restructuring divisional equity. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Net Sales Our net sales by reportable segments are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change Due to (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Volume Price ForeignExchange Asia/Latin America $ 1,625.5 $ 1,516.9 7 % 3 % 10 % (6 %) North America/Europe 1,201.0 1,365.5 (12 %) (10 %) 0 % (2 %) Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2 %) (3 %) 5 % (4 %) Our Asia/Latin America segment represented 58% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 53% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our success in the Asia/Latin America segment comes from the benefit of price increases, geographic expansion and new product launches. Sales growth in China, our second largest market, was the highest of the major markets in which we operate on a year to date basis, and many other Asian and Latin American countries increased sales by double digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Volume growth in the segment was adversely affected by approximately two percentage points due to the temporary operating model change in Brazil, in place during most of 2009, pending the transfer of certain permits and registrations previously held by BMS. In 2010, we expect volume growth to be favorably affected as we will have a full year of product distribution in Brazil. The decrease in North America/Europe sales was primarily due to weaker performance in the United States driven by share losses, the contraction in the U.S. market from lower births, and the impact of planned reductions in inventories held by BMS who is temporarily serving as our distributor in Europe. A number of new products were introduced in the United States in 2009, which were supported by increased marketing, advertising and promotion spending. As a result, our U.S. business began to stabilize in the second half of 2009. With the inventory adjustments now complete, we expect volumes for the segment to benefit in 2010 compared with 2009. Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Infant Formula $ 1,805.6 $ 1,931.6 (7 %) Childrens Nutrition 919.0 855.9 7 % Other 101.9 94.9 7 % Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2 %) Excluding foreign exchange, infant formula decreased 4% reflecting the decreases in the North America/Europe segment, which are predominantly infant formula markets. Excluding foreign exchange, childrens nutrition increased 14%, reflecting the strength of the business in Asia/Latin America. 39 Table of Contents We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Gross Sales $ 3,864.6 $ 3,974.2 (3% ) Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates (735.7 ) (796.0 ) (8% ) Sales Discounts (100.4 ) (87.9 ) 14% Returns (72.0 ) (64.7 ) 11% Cash Discounts (45.1 ) (46.9 ) (4% ) Prime Vendor Charge Backs (38.5 ) (42.2 ) (9% ) Coupons and Other Adjustments (46.4 ) (54.1 ) (14% ) Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments (1,038.1 ) (1,091.8 ) (5% ) Total Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2% ) The decline in Women, Infants and Children (WIC) rebates was due to a decline in U.S. births and a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) change which resulted in a reduction in the amount of free infant formula provided by WIC agencies to infants. The change in sales discounts was due to promotional mix and new product launches in 2009. The relative increase in returns was due to an abnormally low amount of returns during fiscal 2008, and the impact of 2009 new product launches with resulting product discontinuations. The reduction in coupons and other adjustments is due to a shift from consumer coupons to sales discounts, primarily driven by the U.S. market. Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2% ) Cost of Products Sold 974.7 1,079.8 (10% ) Gross Profit $ 1,851.8 $ 1,802.6 3% Gross Margin 65.5% 62.5% The improvement in gross margin was driven by reduced commodity costs, primarily dairy, higher product pricing and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the adverse effect of foreign exchange, product mix, plant deleveraging, and manufacturing inflation. Expenses Year Ended December 31, % Change % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Selling, General and Administrative $ 665.3 $ 651.7 2% 24% 23% Advertising and Product Promotion 401.9 369.3 9% 14% 13% Research and Development 71.9 72.8 (1% ) 3% 3% Other Expenses net 33.1 13.1 1% 0% 40 Table of Contents Included in the above table are the following significant expenses that affect comparability in 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 IPO related costs $ 31.0 $ 44.8 IT separation costs 19.2 Gain on asset sale (11.9 ) Severance and related costs 25.3 Litigation costs and settlements net 17.5 Total $ 81.1 $ 44.8 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mostly due to increases in IPO related costs, IT separation costs and additional corporate expenses that we now carry as a public company, partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Advertising and Product Promotion Expenses Our advertising and product promotion expenses are influenced by the timing of our key product launches and promotions and have increased to 14% of sales as we continue to invest in growing our business. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased slightly compared to prior year due to the adverse effect of foreign exchange. Other Expenses net Other expenses net for the year ended December 31, 2009, changed by $20.0 million due primarily to severance and related costs, litigation costs and settlements net, partly offset by a gain on the sale of a non strategic intangible asset. Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes Our EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe are reduced by Corporate and Other costs. Corporate and Other costs consist of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses, including in part, executive, legal, finance, information technology, human resources, research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, % Change % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Asia/Latin America $ 577.0 $ 462.9 25 % 35 % 31 % North America/Europe 391.8 467.3 (16 %) 33 % 34 % Corporate and Other (289.2 ) (234.5 ) 23 % EBIT $ 679.6 $ 695.7 (2 %) 24 % 24 % The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was driven by higher net sales and improved gross margin. The decrease in EBIT for North America/Europe was primarily due to lower net sales partially offset by improved gross margins, lower distribution costs and sales force productivity initiatives. 41 Table of Contents The increase in expenses for the Corporate and Other segment was principally due to the significant expenses that affect comparability described in the table above and the additional corporate expenses that we now carry as a public company. Interest Expense net Interest expense net for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily represented interest incurred on three notes payable to BMS totaling $1.7 billion repaid in November 2009 and, to a lesser extent, interest incurred on the three tranches of notes totaling $1.5 billion that were issued in a private placement to third parties in November 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense net represented interest incurred on the previously outstanding $2.0 billion note payable to BMS issued in August 2008. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $30 million lower in 2010 than 2009 as a result of the November refinancing. Income Taxes The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased to 30.1% from 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The lower rate was driven primarily by our new legal entity structure to facilitate the IPO, one time restructuring benefits, and earnings mix. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the year ended December 31, 2009, net earnings attributable to shareholders increased by $5.7 million to $399.6 million compared with $393.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in the ETR and an improvement in gross margin, offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher interest expense. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: % of Net Sales (In millions, except per share data) 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 12% Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 695.7 663.2 5% 24 % 26 % Interest Expense net (43.3 ) 2 % Earnings before Income Taxes 652.4 663.2 (2% ) 23 % 26 % Provision for Income Taxes (251.4 ) (233.6 ) 8% 9 % 9 % Effective Tax Rate 38.5 % 35.2 % Net Earnings 401.0 429.6 (7% ) 14 % 17 % Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest (7.1 ) (7.1 ) 0% 0 % 0 % Net Earnings attributable to shareholders 393.9 422.5 (7% ) 14 % 16 % Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted 170.0 170.0 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 2.32 $ 2.49 (7% ) IPO related costs of $44.8 million are included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2008, which effect comparability between the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. 42 Table of Contents Net Sales Our net sales by reportable segments are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, % Change % Change Due toForeign Exchange (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Asia/Latin America $ 1,516.9 $ 1,225.2 24% 3% North America/Europe 1,365.5 1,351.2 1% 1% Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 12% 2% Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased $306.0 million, or 12%, to $2,882.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The percentage change in sales was driven by a price increase of 8% and volume growth of 2%, and included a 2% positive foreign exchange impact. Net sales increased throughout Asia, Latin America and Europe offset by a slight decline in the United States. Net sales increased in all product categories, driven by pricing increases in response to increased dairy costs, the impact of increased advertising and promotion, regional expansion within key Asian markets, most notably China, and product innovation. Innovations launched in the period include the addition of prebiotics and an increase in the level of DHA in several of our products in Asia. Additionally, in North America, we launched Nutramigen AA, an amino acid based infant formula for infants with severe food allergies. The decline in the U.S. business was attributable to growth in private label products, due in part to the weakening economy, and the impact of WIC contract changes on our business. Our Asia/Latin America segment represented 53% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 48% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Growth in Asia/Latin America was broad based across all major markets driven by pricing increases and strong volume growth in China and Hong Kong. The net sales growth was underpinned by higher advertising and promotion supporting new product launches including the addition of prebiotics and the increase in the level of DHA in some childrens nutrition products in Asia. In addition, we experienced a temporary increase in demand for our products in China due to the withdrawal of certain infant formula products of other manufacturers due to the presence of melamine in certain dairy materials sourced in country. We do not use dairy or protein containing raw ingredients from China in our products. The slight increase in our North America/Europe segment was due primarily to pricing increases offset by U.S. volume losses attributable to growth in private label products, due in part to the weakening economy, and the impact of WIC contract changes on our business. Our net sales based on product category are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Infant Formula $ 1,931.6 $ 1,788.1 8% Childrens Nutrition 855.9 696.5 23% Other 94.9 91.8 3% Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 12% Net sales for the period increased in each of our product categories. For the year ended December 31, 2008, infant formula sales increased $143.5 million, or 8%, including a positive 2% foreign currency exchange impact, to $1,931.6 million compared to 2007. Growth in the sales of infant formula, which is sold in all regions, reflects a mix of the higher growth in the Asia/Latin America segment and the lower growth in the North America/ Europe segment. Childrens nutrition products, sold primarily in the Asia/Latin America segment, increased $159.4 million, or 23%, including a positive 3% foreign currency exchange impact, to $855.9 million in 2008, in line with the broad based growth across our key Asia and Latin America markets. 43 Table of Contents We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales was as follows: Years Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Gross Sales $ 3,974.2 $ 3,717.2 7% Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates (796.0 ) (847.8 ) (6% ) Sales Discounts (87.9 ) (66.3 ) 33% Returns (64.7 ) (67.6 ) (4% ) Cash Discounts (46.9 ) (48.0 ) (2% ) Prime Vendor Charge Backs (42.2 ) (47.5 ) (11% ) Other Adjustments (54.1 ) (63.6 ) (15% ) Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments (1,091.8 ) (1,140.8 ) (4% ) Total Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 12% The decline in gross to net sales adjustments was generated by changes in WIC rebates in North America due to the loss of the Western States Contracting Alliance, Texas, Minnesota and Iowa WIC contracts to other infant formula manufacturers during the fourth quarter of 2007, partially offset by the gain of California and Louisiana WIC contracts during the second half of 2007, as well as the gain of Illinois and Colorado WIC contracts during the first quarter of 2008. Sales discounts increased during the same period primarily in key Asia markets due to revenue growth and a change in retail sales mix to key customers with higher discounts. Other adjustments include coupons, contract discounts and various rebates. The decrease in other adjustments was driven primarily by a decline in consumer coupons. Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Net Sales $ 2,882.4 $ 2,576.4 12% Cost of Products Sold 1,079.8 948.7 14% Gross Profit $ 1,802.6 $ 1,627.7 11% Gross Margin 62.5 % 63.2 % The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by global material price increases. In 2007, the market volatility in material prices was mitigated partially through the contractual pricing agreements we entered into during 2006 and prior periods. However, many of these contracts expired in late 2007, resulting in an increase in our costs of products sold in 2008. Additionally, the costs of products sold increase was driven by sales volume growth and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Furthermore, the gross margin decrease was driven by product mix changes as lower margin childrens nutrition products experienced more rapid volume gains than higher margin infant formulas. Expenses Years Ended December 31, % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 Selling, General and Administrative $ 651.7 $ 575.2 13 % 23 % 22 % Advertising and Product Promotion 369.3 318.5 16 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development 72.8 67.2 8 % 3 % 3 % Other Expenses net 13.1 3.6 0 % 0 % 44 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The majority of the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to $41.8 million of non recurring costs related to our initial public offering and $19.3 million of higher corporate and shared service expense allocations. The increase was also driven by additional marketing efforts in Asia, including sales force expansion in China, and global salary and benefits increases due to inflation. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar also drove an increase in expense. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of a $17.6 million bad debt expense in the first half of 2007 related to a distributors insolvency in Asia. Advertising and Product Promotion Expenses The increase in advertising and product promotion expenses was driven in large part by a strategic decision to increase various demand generating activities in key Asian markets, investment in promotional programs in Mexico and by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses was driven mainly by increased investment in clinical and discovery trials, salary and benefits inflation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Other Expenses net For the year ended December 31, 2008, other expenses net increased $9.5 million, to $13.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was driven by the losses in 2008 on our supply agreement for our former Adult Nutrition business, which was divested in 2004, and a non recurring gain on the 2007 divestiture of Cafcit, a pediatric pharmaceutical product. Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes Our EBIT are from our two reportable segments, North America/Europe and Asia/Latin America, reduced by Corporate and Other costs. Corporate and Other costs consist of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses, including in part, executive, legal, finance, information technology, human resources, research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, % Change % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Asia/Latin America $ 462.9 $ 363.9 27 % 31 % 30 % North America/Europe 467.3 477.6 (2 %) 34 % 35 % Corporate and Other (234.5 ) (178.3 ) 32 % EBIT $ 695.7 $ 663.2 5 % 24 % 26 % The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was primarily driven by growth in sales and the absence of $17.6 million bad debt expense in 2007 related to a distributors insolvency, partially offset by increases in material costs. The decrease in North America/Europe EBIT was driven by sales declines in the United States and increases in material costs. The change in Corporate and Other EBIT was principally due to $44.8 million in expenses related to our initial public offering and an increase in corporate and shared service expense allocations from $90.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, to $112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. 45 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased from 35.2% to 38.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by the capitalization in 2008 of certain initial public offering expenses for tax purposes, the benefit of certain basis differences reflected in the 2007 effective tax rate and changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction. Interest Expense net Interest expense net for the year ended December 31, 2008, represented interest incurred on the $2.0 billion note payable issued in August 2008. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the foregoing reasons, for the year ended December 31, 2008, net earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $28.6 million, or 7%, to $393.9 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and available borrowings under our $410.0 million revolving credit facility (Credit Facility). Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our customers and the outflow of cash for inventory purchases, manufacturing, operating expenses, interest and taxes. Cash flows used in investing activities primarily represent capital expenditure for equipment, buildings and computer software. In 2009, cash flows from financing activities primarily represent activities related to the IPO and separation from BMS, the refinancing of debt and the payment of dividends to our shareholders. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements and other factors our board of directors deem relevant. Cash dividends paid for the year ended December 31, 2009, were $102.3 million. There were no cash dividends paid in 2008. Cash Flows Prior to the IPO, we did not report cash or cash equivalents on our balance sheet and BMS managed the treasury relationships for receiving and disbursing cash to cover all cash flow activity from operations and investing activities. Following the IPO, we assumed responsibility for our treasury function, including the management and reporting of cash and cash equivalents, with support services provided by BMS under a transition services agreement. We believe that cash from operations will be sufficient to support our working capital needs, pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt obligations, fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments. As of February 25, 2010, we have $410 million available to us under our Credit Facility. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating Activities $ 576.6 $ 489.0 $ 478.7 Investing Activities (81.3 ) (79.4 ) (74.2 ) Financing Activities 49.1 (409.6 ) (404.5 ) Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Cash and Cash Equivalents 16.7 Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 561.1 $ $ 46 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. The improvement primarily reflected a decline in our inventories during 2009 compared with an increase during 2008 due to lower commodity costs. The impact of the change in inventories was partially offset by an increase in receivables and changes in other current assets and liabilities as well as working capital management initiatives which also resulted in some extension in accounts payable terms. Cash used in investing activities increased $1.9 million due to an increase in payments for capital expenditures, partially offset by the cash inflow before taxes from the sale of a non strategic intangible asset. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $49.1 million in 2009 comprised of $1,495.3 million from the private placement of notes in the fourth quarter, $782.3 million net cash proceeds from the IPO, $120 million from net short term borrowings and $137.7 million net transfers from BMS partly offset by $2,348.1 million repayment of BMS debt, $30.0 million promissory note from BMS, dividend payments of $102.3 million and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $5.8 million. The net transfer from BMS included in financing activities during 2009 consisted mainly of $316.0 million cash contribution from BMS made in connection with our separation from BMS offset by $166.8 million settlement of related party payables. This compares to cash used in financing activities of $409.6 million in 2008 comprised of net transfers to BMS of $397.9 million and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $11.7 million. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $10.3 million to $489.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was due to a reduction in working capital in 2008 as compared to an increase in 2007, offset by a decline in net earnings attributable to shareholders of $28.6 million, which was driven by IPO expenses and interest costs. The favorable change in working capital is due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash used in investing activities increased $5.2 million to $79.4 million for the same period due to an increase in capital expenditures and a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of equipment and a non strategic intangible asset. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, of which $95.8 million was a cash outflow. The cash outflow for capital expenditures was $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect capital expenditures in 2010 to be approximately $140 million with the increase primarily driven by IT separation costs and investment in growth and innovation. Short Term Borrowings On February 17, 2009, we entered into a Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is unsecured and repayable on maturity in February 2012, subject to annual extensions if sufficient lenders agree. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit permitted at any one time under the Credit Facility is $410.0 million, which amount may be increased from time to time up to $500.0 million at our request and with the consent of the lenders, subject to customary conditions. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In November 2009, we amended the Credit Facility to include the ability to use proceeds to repay amounts owed to BMS. On December 16, 2009, we further amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, release our subsidiary Mead Johnson & Company as a guarantor of our obligations under the Credit Facility. If, however, our corporate credit rating is no longer (i) at least BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Service (S&P) or (ii) at least Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), then Mead Johnson & Company shall automatically be deemed to guarantee the obligations under the Credit Facility. 47 Table of Contents Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest either at (a) LIBOR for specified interest periods plus a margin determined with reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a floating rate based upon JPMorgan Chase Banks prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR plus, in each case, a margin determined with reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. The margin on the borrowings can range from 1.125% to 2.65% over the applicable base. In addition, we incur an annual 0.2% facility fee on the entire facility commitment of $410.0 million. Our subsidiaries may become borrowers under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants applicable to limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The Credit Facility also contains the following financial covenants: We are required to maintain a ratio of (a) consolidated total debt to (b) consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.0. Compliance with this covenant is tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter and as a condition precedent to each credit extension under the Credit Facility. We are required to maintain a ratio of (a) consolidated EBITDA to (b) consolidated interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0. Compliance with this covenant is tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. In addition, the Credit Facility has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control, ERISA matters and cross default to other debt agreements. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2009. The balance of $120.0 million is classified as short term borrowings as of December 31, 2009, and was paid in full in January 2010. Long Term Debt On August 26, 2008, we declared and issued a dividend in the form of a 10 year note to BMS in the amount of $2.0 billion, which was recorded as a reduction of equity. The note had an annual interest rate of 6.1% with interest payments settled no less than annually. On February 17, 2009, this note payable was amended and restructured into three separate notes in the amounts of $744.2 million, $500.0 million and $500.0 million (BMS Notes). In November 2009, we repaid the BMS Notes in full through the net proceeds from the private placement of three tranches of notes (the Notes), totaling $1.5 billion, along with borrowings under the Credit Facility and cash on hand. The issuance of the Notes lowered our interest expense and extended the weighted average maturity date. The Notes are detailed in the table below: Description Principal Amount Interest Rate Terms 2014 Notes $ 500.0 million 3.50% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2014 2019 Notes $ 700.0 million 4.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2019 2039 Notes $ 300.0 million 5.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2039 The Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with each other and with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Notes may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of par value or an amount calculated based upon the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments as set forth in a First Supplemental Indenture dated November 5, 2009. Upon a change of control, we may be required to repurchase the notes in an amount equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. 48 Table of Contents In connection with issuance of the Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the representatives of the initial purchasers of the Notes (Registration Rights Agreement). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for freely tradable notes issued by us that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes. If we are unable to effect the exchange offer, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes. We will be obligated to pay additional interest on the Notes if the exchange offer is not completed (or, if required, the shelf registration is not declared effective) by August 2, 2010. In November 2009, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $700.0 million. The interest rate swap agreements effectively swap fixed interest rate obligations for floating interest rate obligations with respect to (i) the entire $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes and (ii) $200.0 million out of the $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes. The following tables summarize the interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2009: (Dollars in millions) NotionalAmount ofUnderlyingDebt Variable Rate Paid Year ofTransaction Maturity FairValue Swaps associated with: 3.50% Notes due 2014 $ 500.0 1 month U.S. $ LIBOR + 0.890% 2009 2014 $ (4.2 ) 4.90% Notes due 2019 200.0 1 month U.S. $ LIBOR + 1.381% 2009 2019 (6.2 ) $ 700.0 $ (10.4 ) For additional information on our long term debt and interest rate swaps, see Item 8. Financial Statements. On January 31, 2009, one of our subsidiaries, Mead Johnson Nutricionales de Mexico, S. De R.L. de C.V., entered into an agreement with BMS to lease all of the property, plant and equipment assets at the manufacturing facility in Delicias, Mexico, for 20 years. The lease qualified as a capital lease, and the property, plant and equipment is included in our financial statements for all periods. As part of the split off from BMS, we purchased these assets for $48.7 million plus applicable taxes in December 2009, and the lease was terminated. The liability related to this purchase was paid in full in January 2010. Credit Ratings The Moodys credit ratings for MJN and for our senior unsecured notes are both currently Baa1. S&Ps credit ratings for MJN and for our senior unsecured notes are currently BBB and BBB , respectively. Both Moodys and S&P issued their first credit ratings for MJN and our notes during the fourth quarter of 2009. Recent Developments We have a subsidiary in Venezuela. As of January 1, 2010, this subsidiary will be accounted for under hyperinflationary accounting rules, and the functional currency will be changed from the bolivar to the U.S. dollar. Effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate from BsF 2.15 per dollar to a two tier exchange rate the essentials rate at BsF 2.60 per dollar and the non essentials rate at BsF 4.30 per dollar. While the imports of the majority of our products into Venezuela qualify for the essentials rate, the rate applicable to repatriation of earnings is not yet determined. Based on a potential translation rate of BsF 4.30 per dollar, we estimate the negative impact of the balance sheet remeasurement on our 2010 first quarter earnings to be approximately $0.03 per share and the negative impact of the rate change on our operating results to be an additional $0.05 per share spread throughout 2010. 49 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2009, our significant contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows: Payments due by December 31, (In millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Operating lease obligations $ 19.6 $ 16.5 $ 14.9 $ 12.5 $ 7.1 $ 28.9 $ 99.5 Capital lease obligations 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 1.9 Purchase obligations 149.2 111.9 72.3 57.8 55.4 201.7 648.3 Long term debt 497.8 997.5 1,495.3 Interest on long term debt 55.7 66.2 74.8 80.4 79.4 611.5 968.0 Total $ 224.9 $ 194.9 $ 162.3 $ 151.0 $ 640.0 $ 1,839.9 $ 3,213.0 Our operating lease obligations are generally related to real estate leases for offices, vehicle leases and manufacturing related leases. Capital lease obligations relate to assets utilized for interplant transportation of materials and finished goods. Purchase obligations are for unconditional commitments related to a master service agreement with IBM for information technology, accounting and indirect procurement services, including the design and implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system, the purchase of materials used in manufacturing and for promotional services, and a transition services agreement for various corporate support services provided between us and BMS. The table above does not include $16.9 million in uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of the positions. The future interest payments on long term debt, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, are estimated based on implied forward LIBOR rates used in the valuation of our interest rate swaps. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement with BMS, we have agreed to indemnify BMS for (i) any tax payable with respect to any separate tax return that we are required to file or cause to be filed, (ii) any tax incurred as a result of any gain that may be recognized by a member of the BMS affiliated group with respect to a transfer of certain foreign affiliates by us in preparation for the IPO, and (iii) any tax arising from the failure or breach of any representation or covenant made by us which failure or breach results in the intended tax consequences of the split off transaction not being achieved. We do not use off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge or partially hedge interest rate exposure nor do we maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions or other financial or investment purposes. Significant Accounting Estimates In presenting our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an on going basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the significant accounting estimates listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. 50 Table of Contents For information on our accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition WIC Rebates We participate on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, we reimburse these entities for the difference between our wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. We account for WIC contract rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. We consider levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts and WIC participation, and adjust the accrual quarterly to reflect actual expense. WIC rebate accruals were $199.9 million and $194.7 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Rebates under the WIC program reduced revenues by $735.7 million, $796.0 million, and $847.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales Returns We account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. We determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns such as new product introductions. Sales return accruals were $33.9 million and $29.3 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Returns reduced sales by $72.0 million, $64.7 million and $67.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including tax holidays, and managements estimate of appropriate reserves against uncertain tax positions. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty in tax positions. The income tax provision prepared in the period following the IPO but preceding the split off reflects a separate return methodology based on the actual legal entity structure as if we were a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions with certain accommodations pursuant to a tax matters agreement as noted below. This is in contrast to the pre IPO period in which the income tax provision was prepared on a separate return stand alone methodology reflecting a hypothetical legal entity structure in which we were included in the tax grouping of other BMS entities within the respective entitys tax jurisdiction. The income tax provision prepared in the post split off period reflects a separate return methodology based on the actual legal entity structure where we are a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable earnings in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The ultimate liability incurred by us may differ from the provision estimates based on a number of factors, including interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities. 51 Table of Contents Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long range forecast of future taxable earnings and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Changes in recognized tax benefits and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but are not expected to be material to our financial position. On February 10, 2009, we entered into a tax matters agreement with BMS. This agreement governs the tax relationship between us and BMS for the tax periods through our December 23, 2009 split off from BMS. Under this agreement, responsibility is allocated between BMS and its subsidiaries, and us for the payment of taxes resulting from filing (i) tax returns on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis and (ii) single entity tax returns for entities that have both MJN and non MJN operations. Accordingly, BMS prepares returns for us for all periods during which we are included in a combined, consolidated or unitary group with BMS or any of its subsidiaries for federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes, as if we ourselves were filing as a combined, consolidated or unitary group. BMS also prepares returns for us for all periods during which a single entity tax return is filed for an entity that has both MJN and non MJN operations. We make payments to BMS and BMS makes payments to us with respect to such returns, as if such returns were actually required to be filed under the laws of the applicable taxing jurisdiction and BMS were the relevant taxing authority of such jurisdiction. On December 18, 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement with BMS. With respect to the period before the split off, the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement allocates the responsibility of BMS and its subsidiaries, and us for the payment of taxes in the same manner as discussed above with respect to the tax matters agreement. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement, we have consented to join BMS in electing to allocate items ratably between the portion of the taxable year in which we were included in the BMS consolidated tax group, and the short period beginning after the split off and ending on December 31, 2009 when we are a separate taxpayer. Additionally under the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement, BMS has agreed to indemnify us for (i) any tax attributable to a Mead Johnson legal entity for any taxable period ending on or before December 31, 2008, (ii) any tax arising solely as a result of the IPO and the restructuring which preceded the IPO, and (iii) any transaction tax associated with the split off transaction. We have agreed to indemnify BMS for (i) any tax payable with respect to any separate return that we are required to file or cause to be filed, (ii) any tax incurred as a result of any gain which may be recognized by a member of the BMS affiliated group with respect to a transfer of certain foreign affiliates by us in preparation for the IPO, and (iii) any tax arising from the failure or breach of any representation or covenant made by us which failure or breach results in the intended tax consequences of the split off transaction not being achieved. We recorded as an equity contribution certain deferred tax assets recorded from BMS as a result of the split off. As of December 31, 2009, based upon the terms of the tax matters agreement discussed above, we hold a net payable of $12.0 million to BMS. This payable is recorded in U.S. and foreign income taxes payable on our balance sheet. Effective with the split off from BMS, we no longer are included in BMS consolidated tax return. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process on an annual basis or when current facts or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. We complete our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the first quarter and monitor for any potential impairment in the remaining quarters, neither of which indicated an impairment of goodwill in 2009, 2008 or 2007. 52 Table of Contents Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Prior to the separation from BMS, employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated in various defined benefit pension plans administered and sponsored by BMS, and our pension and post retirement plans were accounted for under a multi employer plan. For pension plans in the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Mexico, costs associated with the pension plans were allocated to us on the basis of pensionable wages. We specifically identified the pension expense attributable to us for participants for the pension plans in the Philippines, Indonesia and the Netherlands. As part of the separation, the BMS defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities for our active U.S. employees were transferred to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Outside of the United States, BMS transferred to MJN defined benefit plans pension assets and liabilities allocable to employees transferring to MJN in certain countries. Our pension plans and post retirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long term returns on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care costs trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and post retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, salary growth rate and expected long term returns on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, we have established the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The discount rate assumptions used to value the pension and post retirement benefit obligations reflect the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts. The salary growth assumption we used for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2009 was determined using discount rate of 7.00% and assumed salary growth rate of 3.56% and the benefit obligation at December 31, 2009, was determined using discount rate of 5.75% and assumed salary growth rate of 3.56%. In developing the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long term historical returns on the asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of the asset classes. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2009 was determined using an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.75% and will be 7.72% for 2010. The following table shows the impact on pension expense of hypothetical changes in the rates assumed for the U.S. pension plan: Increase/(Decrease) inExpense Increase/(Decrease) inObligation (Dollars in millions) Change in Rate Increase inRate Decrease inRate Increase inRate Decrease inRate Impact of change in rates: Discount rate +/ 25 basis points $ $ $ (7.6 ) $ 7.8 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets +/ 100 basis points (1.6 ) 1.6 N/A N/A 53 Table of Contents See Item 8. Financial Statements for additional information on our pension and post retirement benefits. Issued but not yet Effective Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2010, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 810, Consolidation, will require companies to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entitys economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. Also effective January 1, 2010, ASC No. 810 will require on going reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary. We do not expect these requirements to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward looking statements by the fact they use words such as should, expect, anticipate, estimate, target, may, project, guidance, intend, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in Item 1A. Risk Factors, that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement. Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, we can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in forward looking statements can be achieved and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 54 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our on going business operations. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Inflation Our materials costs are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices, principally dairy, agricultural oils and tinplate. In addition, costs for construction, taxes, repairs, maintenance, insurance and media are all subject to inflationary pressures. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, the Philippine peso, the Mexican peso, the euro, the Malaysian ringitt and the Canadian dollar. In addition to these primary exposures, as a global business, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk in all countries in which we do business whose local reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar. For example, in Venezuela, the application of hyperinflationary accounting coupled with the government directed devaluation of the local currency and prohibitive currency controls will negatively impact our 2010 results as discussed within the Recent Development section of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Prior to the separation from BMS, we used derivative financial instruments indirectly through participation in the centralized hedging functions of BMS, which were designed primarily to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk, and we have continued to use derivative financial instruments for this purpose. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings. The foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of $5.0 million, $0.9 million, and $2.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on our earnings was not material. We enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available. Derivative financial instruments will not be used for speculative purposes. The intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2009 was $64.2 million, representing a net settlement payable of approximately $3.3 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, transaction exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 14 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement payable would have increased by approximately $7.5 million. The unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Commodity Risk We purchase certain products in the normal course of business, including dairy and agricultural oils, the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes. Therefore, we are exposed to some price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. 55 Table of Contents We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility. Generally, these techniques include unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time and setting fixed prices with suppliers. We do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, partially because of these contract pricing techniques. As of December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. Primary exposures include movements in U.S Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. The nature and amount of our short term and long term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our debt obligations totaled $1.6 billion (including $10.4 million relating to the fair value of interest rate swaps adjustment). For information on our debt obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements. In order to manage interest rate expense and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swaps agreements. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations that are attributed to the hedged risk, are recognized in current period earnings. We had interest rate contracts with a total notional amount of $700.0 million at December 31, 2009. Assuming average variable debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in LIBOR would have increased interest expense by approximately $7 million in 2009. 56 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Prior to the separation from BMS, we used derivative financial instruments indirectly through participation in the centralized hedging functions of BMS, which were designed primarily to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk, and we have continued to use derivative financial instruments for this purpose. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings. The foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of $5.0 million, $0.9 million, and $2.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on our earnings was not material. We enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available. Derivative financial instruments will not be used for speculative purposes. The intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2009 was $64.2 million, representing a net settlement payable of approximately $3.3 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, transaction exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 14 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement payable would have increased by approximately $7.5 million. The unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Commodity Risk We purchase certain products in the normal course of business, including dairy and agricultural oils, the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes. Therefore, we are exposed to some price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. 55 Table of Contents We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility. Generally, these techniques include unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time and setting fixed prices with suppliers. We do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, partially because of these contract pricing techniques.
