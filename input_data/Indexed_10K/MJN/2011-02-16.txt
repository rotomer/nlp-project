Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with those statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes to our audited financial statements. Our results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those in Risk Factors. Overview of Our Business We are a global leader in pediatric nutrition. We are committed to creating trusted nutritional brands and products that help improve the health and development of infants and children around the world and provide them with the best start in life. Our comprehensive product portfolio addresses a broad range of nutritional needs for infants, children and expectant and nursing mothers. We have over 100 years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or industry defining products across each of our product categories. We operate in four geographic regions: Asia, Latin America, North America and Europe. Due to similarities in the economics, products offered, production process, customer base and regulatory environment, these operating regions have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Executive Summary We delivered strong sales and earnings growth in 2010 while increasing investments in demand generation activities and building our stand alone infrastructure. Our Asia/Latin America segment continued double digit sales growth with solid market share gains across the segment. Despite continued declines in both births and formula consumption, sales in the North America/Europe segment grew due to U.S. market share gains, lower WIC rebates, and a 2009 reduction in customer inventory in the European business. Although gross margin was pressured from increased commodity and manufacturing costs, we were able to partially mitigate the effect through productivity gains and higher pricing. During 2010, we continued to invest in our sales force and other demand generation activities. In order to enhance our product innovation capabilities, we opened new Pediatric Nutrition Institutes (PNI) in Evansville, Indiana, and Mexico City, Mexico, and broke ground on a new PNI in Guangzhou, China. We completed the build of our new corporate functions, made significant progress on our stand alone IT platform, and incurred a temporary duplication of costs as we transition to a new shared service provider. These increases in expense were partly offset by benefits from lower interest expense as a result of our debt refinancing and a reduced effective tax rate. Our strong sales growth, supported by our investment in demand generation activities, contributed to earnings growth of 13%. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: % of Net Sales (In millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11 % Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 682.9 679.6 0 % 22 % 24 % Interest Expense net 48.6 92.6 (48 %) 2 % 3 % Earnings before Income Taxes 634.3 587.0 8 % 20 % 21 % Provision for Income Taxes 176.1 176.4 0 % 6 % 6 % Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 27.8 % 30.1 % Net Earnings 458.2 410.6 12 % 15 % 15 % Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 5.5 11.0 (50 %) 0 % 0 % Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 452.7 399.6 13 % 14 % 14 % Weighted Average Common Shares Diluted 205.1 200.7 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 2.20 $ 1.99 11 % The results for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included several items that affect the comparability of our results. These items include significant expenses not indicative of on going results (Specified Items) and are listed in the table below. Year EndedDecember 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 IT and other separation costs $ 57.1 $ 19.2 Severance and other costs 5.1 25.3 Legal, settlements and related costs 9.2 17.5 IPO related costs 31.0 Gain on asset sale (11.9 ) Specified Items before income taxes $ 71.4 $ 81.1 Income tax impact on items above (25.9 ) (24.4 ) Specified Items after taxes $ 45.5 $ 56.7 Net Sales Our net sales by reportable segments are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change Due to (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Volume Price ForeignExchange Asia/Latin America $ 1,927.1 $ 1,625.5 19 % 10 % 6 % 3 % North America/Europe 1,214.5 1,201.0 1 % 0 % 0 % 1 % Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11 % 5 % 4 % 2 % Our Asia/Latin America segment continues to have significant sales growth and represented 61% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 58% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our success in Asia/Latin America comes from market growth and share gains driven by our investments in advertising and promotion, sales force, and product innovation. The most notable sales gains were achieved in China, 33 Table of Contents Hong Kong, Mexico and Brazil. Our strongest performance continues to be in China, primarily reflecting market growth, increased market share and geographic expansion. The segment was adversely affected by sales declines in Venezuela primarily due to the devaluation of the bolivar. For the year ended December 31, 2010, sales in the North America/Europe segment grew slightly compared with the prior year. The U.S. business improvements from market share gains, due to successful new product launches and a competitors temporary product recall, and lower WIC rebates were offset by the contraction in the U.S. market from lower births. The European business grew due to a 2009 reduction in customer inventory in the European business in preparation for the eventual move from Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) as our primary distributor. Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Infant Formula $ 1,945.4 $ 1,805.6 8 % Childrens Nutrition 1,119.2 919.0 22 % Other 77.0 101.9 (24 %) Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11 % Infant formula sales increased 8%, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1%, reflecting results in the North America/Europe segment, which are predominantly infant formula markets, and growth in the Asia/Latin America segment. Childrens nutrition sales increased 22%, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4%, reflecting the strength of the Asia/Latin America segment where over 90% of our children nutrition sales are generated. The decline in other products is primarily driven by the expiration of a 2009 marketing services agreement under which we sold pharmaceutical products in two Asia markets on behalf of BMS. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, % of GrossSales (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Gross Sales $ 4,151.2 $ 3,864.6 100 % 100 % Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates 680.8 735.7 16 % 19 % Sales Discounts 118.4 100.4 3 % 3 % Returns 84.3 72.0 2 % 2 % Cash Discounts 44.0 45.1 1 % 1 % Prime Vendor Charge Backs 34.8 38.5 1 % 1 % Coupons and Other Adjustments 47.3 46.4 1 % 1 % Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments 1,009.6 1,038.1 24 % 27 % Total Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 76 % 73 % Gross to net sales adjustments declined as a percentage of gross sales due to a decline in WIC rebates. The decline in WIC rebates was due to a reduction in the amount of infant formula provided under the program and a reduction in WIC participants due to lower birth rates. 34 Table of Contents Gross Profit Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11 % Cost of Products Sold 1,149.6 974.7 18 % Gross Profit $ 1,992.0 $ 1,851.8 8 % Gross Margin 63.4 % 65.5 % Gross margin declined compared to a year ago due to increased commodity and manufacturing costs, partially offset by productivity gains and higher product pricing.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses Our advertising spending primarily includes television and other consumer media. Promotion activities primarily include product trial and education provided to both health care professionals and consumers, where permissible by regulation. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses reflected continued investment in demand generation activities in support of our strategic growth initiatives. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses reflected our continued investment in our innovation capability and product pipeline. Other Expense/(Income) net (OIE) For the year ended December 31, 2010, OIE included $10.6 million in pension settlement costs for defined benefit plans, an $8.5 million foreign currency loss from the initial balance sheet remeasurement of our Venezuela subsidiary upon the devaluation of the bolivar and the application of highly inflationary accounting, and severance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, OIE included litigation costs, severance costs, and currency losses on assets held in non functional currencies, partially offset by a gain on sale of a non strategic intangible asset and a favorable patent settlement. 35 Table of Contents Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe, is reduced by Corporate and Other expenses. Corporate and Other consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses and global business support activities, including research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Asia/Latin America $ 646.1 $ 577.0 12 % North America/Europe 357.7 391.8 (9 %) Corporate and Other (320.9 ) (289.2 ) 11 % EBIT $ 682.9 $ 679.6 0 % The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was due to sales growth partially offset by increased expenses, primarily higher advertising and promotion costs, along with sales force growth, and a lower gross margin, primarily due to higher commodity and manufacturing costs, partially offset by productivity gains. The decrease in EBIT for North America/Europe was primarily due to a lower gross margin reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing costs, partly offset by productivity gains. Corporate and Other expenses increased due to increased IT and other separation costs, the Shared Service Overlap, new stand alone corporate costs and the absence of a gain in 2009 on the sale of a non strategic intangible asset, partly offset by the elimination of IPO related costs. Interest Expense net Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily represented interest incurred on $1.5 billion of notes. Interest expense declined by $44.0 million due to lower interest rates resulting from our November 2009 debt refinancing, combined with the benefit from fixed to floating interest rate swaps on a portion of that debt, and a reduction in debt. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense primarily represented interest incurred on $1.7 billion of notes. The average interest rate on our long term debt, including the impact of the swaps, was 3.6% and 5.3% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes The ETR for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, was 27.8% and 30.1%, respectively. The difference in the rates was primarily attributable to the benefits of a tax ruling in the Netherlands, managements assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently invested abroad, and a favorable change in our geographic earnings mix. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the foregoing reasons, net earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $452.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2009. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: % of Net Sales (In millions, except per share data) 2009 2008 % Change 2009 2008 Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2 %) Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 679.6 695.7 (2 %) 24 % 24 % Interest Expense net 92.6 43.3 114 % 3 % 2 % Earnings before Income Taxes 587.0 652.4 (10 %) 21 % 23 % Provision for Income Taxes 176.4 251.4 (30 %) 6 % 9 % Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 30.1 % 38.5 % Net Earnings 410.6 401.0 2 % 15 % 14 % Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 11.0 7.1 55 % 0 % 0 % Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 399.6 393.9 1 % 14 % 14 % Weighted Average Common Shares Diluted 200.7 170.0 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 1.99 $ 2.32 (14 %) Factors Affecting Comparability Included in the above table are the following significant expenses that affect comparability in 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 IPO related costs $ 31.0 $ 44.8 IT and other separation costs 19.2 Gain on asset sale (11.9 ) Severance and other costs 25.3 Legal, settlements and related costs 17.5 Total $ 81.1 $ 44.8 The results for the year ended December 31, 2009, include several items that affect the comparability of the companys financial results between 2009 and 2008. These items include significant expenses not indicative of on going results, interest expense, operating model changes, the ETR and the number of shares outstanding. In 2009 we incurred $81.1 million of expense for significant items not indicative of on going results including IPO related costs, IT separation costs, gain on asset sale, severance and relocation costs and legal costs and settlements. In 2008 we incurred $44.8 million in IPO related costs. Interest expense increased $49.3 million in 2009 due to the addition of debt to our capital structure beginning in the third quarter of 2008. On August 26, 2008, we issued a $2.0 billion intercompany note to BMS. The note was restructured at the IPO date reducing the related party debt to approximately $1.7 billion. In November 2009, we repaid these notes to BMS in full through the net proceeds from the private placement of three tranches of notes, totaling $1.5 billion, along with borrowings under our three year syndicated credit facility agreement (Credit Facility) and cash on hand. Net interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2009, was $92.6 million compared with $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our 2009 results include operating model changes primarily in Brazil and Europe. In Brazil, our ability to operate as a new stand alone subsidiary was delayed from February to late in September 2009. During that time, BMS distributed and recorded sales for our products and we conducted marketing activities. In Europe, we have 37 Table of Contents transitioned to a third party distributor model with BMS temporarily serving as our distributor. This reduced net sales by the amount of the distributors margin and lowered costs for the distribution related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the ETR was 30.1% compared with 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The lower rate was driven primarily by our new legal entity structure to facilitate the IPO, one time restructuring benefits, and earnings mix. Prior to February 10, 2009, there were 170.0 million shares of common stock outstanding, all held by BMS. We issued an additional 34.5 million shares of common stock in the IPO. On November 15, 2009, BMS announced an exchange offer whereby BMS shareholders could exchange shares of BMS common stock for shares of MJN stock held by BMS. Prior to the completion of the exchange offer, BMS converted all its MJN Class B common stock into MJN Class A common stock. The exchange offer was completed on December 23, 2009, resulting in the split off of MJN from BMS, after which BMS had no equity or voting interest in us. In addition to these items that affect the comparability of the 2009 results of operations to 2008, there are several adjustments to the balance sheet related to our separation from BMS including the recognition of pension, inclusion of cash balances and restructuring divisional equity. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Net Sales Our net sales by reportable segments are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change Due to (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Volume Price ForeignExchange Asia/Latin America $ 1,625.5 $ 1,516.9 7 % 3 % 10 % (6 %) North America/Europe 1,201.0 1,365.5 (12 %) (10 %) 0 % (2 %) Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2 %) (3 %) 5 % (4 %) Our Asia/Latin America segment represented 58% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 53% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our success in the Asia/Latin America segment comes from the benefit of price increases, geographic expansion and new product launches. Sales growth in China, our second largest market, was the highest of the major markets in which we operate, and many other Asian and Latin American countries increased sales by double digits, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Volume growth in the segment was adversely affected by approximately two percentage points due to the temporary operating model change in Brazil, in place during most of 2009, pending the transfer of certain permits and registrations previously held by BMS. The decrease in North America/Europe sales was primarily due to weaker performance in the United States driven by share losses, the contraction in the U.S. market from lower births, and the impact of planned reductions in inventories held by BMS who is temporarily serving as our distributor in Europe. A number of new products were introduced in the United States in 2009, which were supported by increased marketing, advertising and promotion spending. 38 Table of Contents Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Infant Formula $ 1,805.6 $ 1,931.6 (7 %) Childrens Nutrition 919.0 855.9 7 % Other 101.9 94.9 7 % Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 (2 %) Excluding foreign exchange, infant formula sales decreased 4% reflecting the decline in the North America/Europe segment, which is predominantly an infant formula market. Excluding foreign exchange, childrens nutrition sales increased 14%, reflecting the strength of the business in Asia/Latin America. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, % of Gross Sales (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Gross Sales $ 3,864.6 $ 3,974.2 100 % 100 % Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates 735.7 796.0 19 % 20 % Sales Discounts 100.4 87.9 3 % 2 % Returns 72.0 64.7 2 % 2 % Cash Discounts 45.1 46.9 1 % 1 % Prime Vendor Charge Backs 38.5 42.2 1 % 1 % Coupons and Other Adjustments 46.4 54.1 1 % 1 % Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments 1,038.1 1,091.8 27 % 27 % Total Net Sales $ 2,826.5 $ 2,882.4 73 % 73 % The decline in WIC rebates was due to a decline in U.S. births and a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) change that resulted in a reduction in the amount of free infant formula provided by WIC agencies to infants. The change in sales discounts was due to promotional mix and new product launches in 2009. The relative increase in returns was due to an abnormally low amount of returns during fiscal 2008, and the impact of 2009 new product launches with resulting product discontinuations. The reduction in coupons and other adjustments is due to a shift from consumer coupons to sales discounts, primarily driven by the U.S. market.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses Our advertising and promotion expenses are influenced by the timing of our key product launches and promotions and have increased to 14% of sales as we continue to invest in growing our business. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased slightly compared to prior year due to the adverse effect of foreign exchange. Other Expenses net Other expenses net for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by $20.0 million due primarily to severance and related costs, litigation costs and settlements net, partly offset by a gain on the sale of a non strategic intangible asset. Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe, is reduced by Corporate and Other expenses. Corporate and Other expenses consist of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses, including in part, executive, legal, finance, information technology, human resources, research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Asia/Latin America $ 577.0 $ 462.9 25 % North America/Europe 391.8 467.3 (16 %) Corporate and Other (289.2 ) (234.5 ) 23 % EBIT $ 679.6 $ 695.7 (2 %) The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was driven by higher net sales and improved gross margin. 40 Table of Contents The decrease in EBIT for North America/Europe was primarily due to lower net sales partially offset by improved gross margins, lower distribution costs and sales force productivity initiatives. The increase in expenses for the Corporate and Other segment was principally due to the significant expenses that affect comparability described in the table above and the additional corporate expenses that we now carry as a public company. Interest Expense net Interest expense net for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily represented interest incurred on three notes payable to BMS totaling $1.7 billion repaid in November 2009 and, to a lesser extent, interest incurred on the three tranches of notes totaling $1.5 billion that were issued in a private placement to third parties in November 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense net represented interest incurred on the previously outstanding $2.0 billion note payable to BMS issued in August 2008. Income Taxes The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased to 30.1% from 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The lower rate was driven primarily by our new legal entity structure to facilitate the IPO, one time restructuring benefits, and earnings mix. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the year ended December 31, 2009, net earnings attributable to shareholders increased by $5.7 million to $399.6 million compared with $393.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in the ETR and an improvement in gross margin, offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher interest expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and available borrowings under our $410.0 million revolving credit facility (Credit Facility). Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our customers and the outflow of cash for inventory purchases, manufacturing, operating expenses, interest and taxes. Cash flows used in investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures for equipment, buildings and computer software. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily represent proceeds and repayments of short term borrowings and dividend payments. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $595.6 million at December 31, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States were $482.9 million at December 31, 2010, and are either determined to be permanently invested to fund non U.S. operations or are planned to be repatriated to the United States. Tax expense on planned cash repatriations to the United States have previously been recognized but will not be paid until the repatriation event. Cash repatriations are subject to meeting regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. 41 Table of Contents The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements and other factors our board of directors deem relevant. Cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $179.6 million and $102.3 million, respectively. There were no cash dividends paid in 2008. On March 16, 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys stock. The repurchase program is primarily intended to offset the dilutive effect on earnings from stock based compensation over the next two to four years. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the number of shares purchased under the program was not significant. Cash Flows We believe that cash from operations will be sufficient to support our working capital needs, pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt obligations, fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments. As of February 14, 2011, we have $410 million available to us under our Credit Facility. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating Activities $ 514.2 $ 576.6 $ 489.0 Investing Activities (174.6 ) (81.3 ) (79.4 ) Financing Activities (306.4 ) 49.1 (409.6 ) Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Cash and Cash Equivalents 1.3 16.7 Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 34.5 $ 561.1 $ Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Cash flow from operating activities fell by $62.4 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Higher earnings, along with increased non cash depreciation and amortization expense and lower cash paid for interest, were more than offset by a smaller reduction in working capital and other short term assets and liabilities, along with increased payments for income taxes and cash contributions to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Cash flow used in investing activities increased $93.3 million primarily due to higher capital spending from investments in our global IT platform and new packaging lines. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2010 included a $5.5 million investment in International Pediatric Nutrition Company, our joint venture with Almarai Company in Saudi Arabia serving countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Cash flow used in financing activities was $306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily from $179.6 million of dividend payments and the net repayment of $120.0 million of our short term Credit Facility borrowing. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and reflected $1,495.3 million from the private placement of notes and $782.3 million net cash proceeds from the IPO, partially offset by $2,348.1 million repayment of BMS debt and other items as described below. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. The improvement primarily reflected a decline in our inventories during 2009 compared with an increase during 2008 due to lower commodity costs. The impact of the change in inventories was partially offset by an increase in receivables and changes in other current assets and liabilities as well as working capital management initiatives which also resulted in some extension in accounts payable terms. 42 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities increased $1.9 million due to an increase in payments for capital expenditures, partially offset by the cash inflow before taxes from the sale of a non strategic intangible asset. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $49.1 million in 2009 comprised of $1,495.3 million from the private placement of notes in the fourth quarter, $782.3 million net cash proceeds from the IPO, $120 million from net short term borrowings and $137.7 million net transfers from BMS partly offset by $2,348.1 million repayment of BMS debt, $30.0 million promissory note from BMS, dividend payments of $102.3 million and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $5.8 million. The net transfer from BMS included in financing activities during 2009 consisted mainly of $316.0 million cash contribution from BMS made in connection with our IPO offset by $166.8 million settlement of related party payables. This compares to cash used in financing activities of $409.6 million in 2008 comprised of net transfers to BMS of $397.9 million and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $11.7 million. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $143.4 million and the cash outflow for capital expenditures of $172.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflected the increased investment in our global IT platform and new packaging lines. Capital expenditures of $122.3 million and the cash outflow for capital expenditures of $95.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, reflected the increased investment in capacity expansion, packaging innovation, and research and development capabilities. The cash outflow for capital expenditures was $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expect capital expenditures in 2011 to be approximately $125 million, including our investment in our global IT platform and continued emphasis on investment in growth and innovation. Short Term Borrowings Our Credit Facility is unsecured and repayable on maturity in February 2012, subject to annual extensions if sufficient lenders agree. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit permitted at any one time under the Credit Facility is $410.0 million, which amount may be increased from time to time up to $500.0 million at our request and with the consent of the lenders, subject to customary conditions. The borrowings from the Credit Facility are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries may become borrowers under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants applicable to limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants whereby the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) cannot exceed 3.25 to 1.0, and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense cannot be less than 3.0 to 1.0. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate that is determined as a base rate plus a margin. The base rate is either (a) LIBOR for a specified interest period, or (b) a floating rate based upon JPMorgan Chase Banks prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR. The margin is determined by reference to the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. The margin can range from 1.125% to 2.65% over the base rate. In addition, we incur an annual 0.2% facility fee on the entire facility commitment of $410.0 million. If our corporate credit rating falls below (i) Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and (ii) BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Service (S&P), then Mead Johnson & Company shall automatically be deemed to guarantee the obligations under the Credit Facility. The Moodys credit rating for MJN is currently Baa1. S&Ps credit rating for MJN is currently BBB. In addition, the Credit Facility has customary events of default, including payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of 43 Table of Contents control, ERISA matters and cross default to other debt agreements. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2010. Short term borrowings were $1.2 million as of December 31, 2010, and consisted of subsidiary borrowings. There were no borrowings from the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010. Long Term Debt The components of our long term debt are detailed in the table below: Description Principal Amount Interest Rate Terms 2014 Notes $ 500.0 million 3.50% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2014 2019 Notes $ 700.0 million 4.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2019 2039 Notes $ 300.0 million 5.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2039 The notes may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of par value or an amount calculated based upon the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments. Upon a change of control, we may be required to repurchase the notes in an amount equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In November 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700.0 million. Interest rate swaps effectively swap fixed interest rate obligations for floating interest rate obligations. In November 2010, we terminated a notional amount of $200.0 million in interest rate swap agreements with a fair value of $16.8 million, to be amortized over the remaining life of the 2019 Notes. The following table summarizes the interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2010: (Dollars in millions) NotionalAmount ofUnderlyingDebt Variable Rate Paid Year ofTransaction Maturity FairValue Swaps associated with: 3.50% Notes due 2014 $ 500.0 1 month U.S. $ LIBOR + 0.890% 2009 2014 $ 20.1 For additional information on our long term debt and interest rate swaps, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2010, our significant contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows: Payments due by December 31, (In millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Operating lease obligations $ 24.5 $ 21.2 $ 17.1 $ 15.2 $ 10.8 $ 23.4 $ 112.2 Capital lease obligations 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.1 1.9 Purchase obligations 182.2 75.7 67.6 49.9 43.8 162.2 581.4 Long term debt 500.0 1,000.0 1,500.0 Interest on long term debt 58.4 61.7 66.7 69.7 52.0 562.0 870.5 Total $ 265.5 $ 158.9 $ 151.8 $ 635.2 $ 106.9 $ 1,747.7 $ 3,066.0 44 Table of Contents Our operating lease obligations are generally related to real estate leases for offices, manufacturing related leases, and vehicle leases. Capital lease obligations relate to assets utilized for interplant transportation of materials and finished goods. Purchase obligations are for unconditional commitments related to a master service agreement with IBM for information technology, accounting and indirect procurement services, including the design and implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system, the purchase of materials used in manufacturing and for promotional services, and a transition services agreement for various corporate support services provided between us and BMS. The table above does not include $19.8 million in uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of the positions. The future interest payments on long term debt, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, are estimated based on implied forward LIBOR rates used in the valuation of our interest rate swaps. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement with BMS, we have agreed to indemnify BMS for (i) any tax payable with respect to any separate tax return that we are required to file or cause to be filed, (ii) any tax incurred as a result of any gain that may be recognized by a member of the BMS affiliated group with respect to a transfer of certain foreign affiliates by us in preparation for the IPO, and (iii) any tax arising from the failure or breach of any representation or covenant made by us which failure or breach results in the intended tax consequences of the split off transaction not being achieved. We do not use off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge or partially hedge interest rate exposure nor do we maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions or other financial or investment purposes. Significant Accounting Estimates In presenting our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an on going basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the significant accounting estimates listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. For information on our accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser. Revenues are reduced at the time of recognition to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience and business trends. Additionally, provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for discounts, WIC rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We offer sales incentives to customers and consumers through various programs consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons. Provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for these items based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. 45 Table of Contents WIC Rebates We participate on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, we reimburse these entities for the difference between our wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. We account for WIC contract rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. We consider levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts and WIC participation, and adjust the accrual periodically throughout the year to reflect actual expense. WIC rebate accruals were $195.3 million and $199.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Rebates under the WIC program reduced revenues by $680.8 million, $735.7 million, and $796.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales Returns We account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. We determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns such as discontinuations and new product introductions. Sales return accruals were $43.5 million and $33.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Returns reduced sales by $84.3 million, $72.0 million, and $64.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including tax rulings, managements assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently invested abroad and managements estimate of appropriate reserves against uncertain tax positions. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty in tax positions. The income tax provision prepared in the post split off period reflects a separate return methodology based on the legal structure where we are a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions. The income tax provision prepared in the period following the IPO but preceding the split off reflects a separate return methodology based on the actual legal entity structure as if we were a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions with certain accommodations pursuant to a tax matters agreement as noted below. This is in contrast to the pre IPO period in which the income tax provision was prepared on a separate return stand alone methodology reflecting a hypothetical legal entity structure in which we were included in the tax grouping of other BMS entities within the respective entitys tax jurisdiction. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable earnings in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The ultimate liability incurred by us may differ from the provision estimates based on a number of factors, including interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long range forecast of future taxable earnings and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. 46 Table of Contents Changes in recognized tax benefits and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but are not expected to be material to our financial position. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Our pension plans and post retirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Management, in consultation with our actuaries, is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, long term returns on plan assets, retirement, salary growth, turnover, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and post retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate and expected long term returns on plan assets. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The discount rate assumptions used to value the pension and post retirement benefit obligations reflect the yield to maturity of high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2010 was determined using a discount rate of 5.75% and assumed salary growth rate of 3.56% and the benefit obligation at December 31, 2010, was determined using a discount rate of 5.50% and assumed salary growth rate of 4.00%. In developing the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long term historical returns on the asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of the asset classes. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2010 was determined using an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 7.72% and will be 7.75% for 2011. The following table shows the impact on pension expense of hypothetical changes in the rates assumed for the U.S. pension plan: Increase/(Decrease) inExpense Increase/(Decrease) inObligation (Dollars in millions) Change in Rate Increase inRate Decrease inRate Increase inRate Decrease inRate Impact of change in rates: Discount rate +/ 25 basis points $ $ $ (4.8 ) $ 5.0 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets +/ 100 basis points $ (1.8 ) $ 1.8 N/A N/A See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our pension and post retirement benefits. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward looking statements by the fact they use words such as should, expect, anticipate, estimate, target, may, project, guidance, intend, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of 47 Table of Contents contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in Item 1A. Risk Factors, that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement. Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, we can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in forward looking statements can be achieved and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 48 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our on going business operations. In addition to our costs for materials, compensation, media, distribution and other purchased services being subject to inflationary pressures, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. To reduce our exposure to these risks, we utilize a variety of contract techniques and financial instruments as described below. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, the Philippine peso, the Mexican peso, the euro, the Malaysian ringitt, the Thai baht, and the Canadian dollar. In addition to these primary exposures, as a global business, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk in all countries in which we do business whose local reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar. For example, in Venezuela, the application of hyperinflationary accounting coupled with the government directed devaluation of the local currency and prohibitive currency controls negatively impacted our 2010 results. We use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings. The foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of $7.8 million, $5.0 million, and $0.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on our earnings was not material. We enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available. Derivative financial instruments will not be used for speculative purposes. The intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments. The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchases to hedge exposures and the total notional amount of these contracts was $142.0 million at December 31, 2010, representing a net settlement payable of $2.3 million. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of December 31, 2010: Contract Amount(in millions) Average ContractualExchange Rate Receive United States dollar/Pay Canadian dollar $ 32.3 1.02 Receive United States dollar/Pay Mexican peso $ 70.7 12.78 Receive United States dollar/Pay Philippine peso $ 39.0 43.60 All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions and mature within 15 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement payable would have increased by $16.0 million. The unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. 49 Table of Contents Commodity Risk We purchase certain products in the normal course of business, including dairy, agricultural oils, and packaging materials, the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes. Therefore, we are exposed to some price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to reduce volatility. Generally, these techniques include unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time and setting fixed prices with suppliers. We do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, partially because of these contract pricing techniques. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. Primary exposures include movements in U.S Treasury rates, LIBOR, and commercial paper rates. The nature and amount of our short term and long term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our debt obligations totaled $1.5 billion, including a fair value of interest rate swaps adjustment of $20.1 million. For information on our debt obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In order to manage interest rate expense and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swaps agreements. These derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations that are attributed to the hedged risk, are recognized in current period earnings. The Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $500.0 million at December 31, 2010. Assuming year end cash balances and debt levels, a one percentage point increase in LIBOR would increase interest expense by $4.0 million. See Note 16 for discussion on the Companys interest rate swaps. 50 Table of Contents
