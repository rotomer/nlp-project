Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Short Term Borrowings and Long Term Debt." This amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including: requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt; requiring us to repay the full amount of our debt upon a change of control triggering event; making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; increasing the risk of future credit rating downgrades of our debt, which could increase future debt costs; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as leveraged as we are; limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise; and limiting our ability to pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. 24 Table of Contents To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. In order to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, we have in the past entered into and exited interest rate swap agreements. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with risks from movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to counter party credit risk for nonperformance and, in the event of nonperformance, to market risk for changes in interest rates. Finally, our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations. As a result, our economic hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Further discussion of our hedging of interest rate risk is included in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." We could evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives, any of which could distract our management or otherwise have a negative effect on our sales, costs and stock price. Our future success may depend on opportunities to buy or obtain rights to other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We could evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic initiatives, alliances, vertical integration opportunities and divestitures. If we attempt to engage in these transactions, we expose ourselves to various inherent risks, including: accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired or combined business; our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; difficulties successfully integrating, operating, maintaining and managing newly acquired operations or employees; difficulties maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business; the potential discovery of latent unethical business practices; the possibility we could incur impairment charges if an acquired business performs below expectations; and the diversion of our managements attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or implement the strategic initiative. If any of the foregoing risks materializes, our results of operations and the results of the proposed transactions would likely differ from ours, and market expectations, and our stock price could, accordingly, decline. In addition, we may not be able to complete desirable transactions for various reasons. 25 Table of Contents We depend on cash flows generated by our subsidiaries, and a failure to receive distributions from our subsidiaries may result in our inability to meet our financial obligations, or to pay dividends. We are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries and certain intellectual property. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets and intellectual property. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders depends upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, tax sharing payments or otherwise. There are a number of other factors that could affect our ability to pay dividends, including the following: lack of availability of cash to pay dividends due to changes in our operating cash flow, capital expenditure requirements, working capital requirements and other cash needs; unexpected or increased operating or other expenses or changes in the timing thereof; restrictions under Delaware law or other applicable law on the amount of dividends that we may pay; a decision by our board of directors to modify or revoke its policy to pay dividends; and the other risks described in this "Risk Factors" section. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and its ability to make any payments will depend on its earnings, the terms of its indebtedness and legal restrictions. Under certain circumstances, legal restrictions may limit or delay our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us in the future. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations. Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Former Parent If our split off from BMS fails to qualify for non recognition of gain and loss, we may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify BMS for any resulting taxes and related expenses, and we believe that the payment if required could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In connection with our split off from BMS on December 23, 2009, BMS and its counsel have relied on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from us, as well as certain covenants by us regarding the future conduct of our business and other matters, the incorrectness or violation of which could affect the qualification for non recognition of gain and loss of our split off from BMS. As a result, BMS and we agreed to certain tax related indemnities set forth in the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement referred to herein. We agreed, generally, to indemnify BMS for taxes and certain related expenses resulting from the failure of our split off from BMS to qualify for non recognition of gain and loss to the extent attributable to (i) the failure of any of our representations to be true or the breach by us of any of our covenants, (ii) the application of Section 355(e) or Section 355(f) of the Internal Revenue Code to any acquisition of our stock or assets or any of our affiliates or (iii) certain other acts or omissions by us or our affiliates. To the extent we become obligated to make an indemnification payment under the Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement, we believe that the payment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we agreed that, for 30 months following the qualification for non recognition of gain and loss of our split off from BMS, if we propose to enter into or permit certain transactions or series of related transactions as a result of which one or more persons would directly or indirectly acquire 10% or more of our total value or total voting power, we would undertake in good faith to provide written notice to BMS, including an explanation as to why such transactions do not cause our split off from BMS to fail to qualify for non recognition of gain and loss. 26 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our failure to successfully execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline. Our continued success in part depends on our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy. We intend to grow our business profitably through several strategic initiatives, including geographic and category expansion and productivity savings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our strategic plan. If we fail to fully implement any material part of our strategic initiatives, or if we achieve these initiatives and they fail to yield the expected benefits, there could be an adverse affect on our business and results of operations. Any such adverse affect on our business and results of operations could result in a decline in the price of our common stock. Anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may result in an entrenchment of management and diminish the value of our common stock. Several provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors, preventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: authorizing our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred shares without stockholder approval; prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; prohibiting shareholder action by written consent; limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings. Additionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. These anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of our common stockholders to benefit from a change of control and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stockholders ability to realize any potential change in control premium.  Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.  Item 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Glenview, Illinois, where we lease office space. We maintain our global supply chain and R&D headquarters in Evansville, Indiana, where we own office, operations and laboratory buildings comprising approximately 700,000 square feet. We also own the seven manufacturing facilities identified in the table below. For additional information related to our seven manufacturing facilities around the world, see "Item 1. Business Global Supply Chain." We lease the vast majority of our office facilities worldwide. 27 Table of Contents The following table illustrates our owned global manufacturing locations, the approximate square footage of the facilities and the reportable segment served by such locations: Location Square Feet Business Segment Served Zeeland, Michigan, United States(1) 512,000 All segments Evansville, Indiana, United States(1)(2) 280,000 All segments Nijmegen, The Netherlands(1) 102,000 All segments Delicias, Chihuahua, Mexico(1) 173,000 Asia/Latin America Chonburi, Thailand(1) 125,000 Asia/Latin America Guangzhou, China(1) 140,000 Asia/Latin America Makati, Philippines(1) 96,000 Asia/Latin America (1)Powder manufacturing facility.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to lawsuits, investigations, government inquiries and claims, including, but not limited to, product liability claims, advertising disputes and inquiries, consumer fraud suits, other commercial disputes, premises claims and employment and environmental, health and safety matters. Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Among other things, these requirements regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the use, management, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, the control of combustible dust, the reduction of noise emissions and fire and explosion risks, the cleanup of contamination and the prevention of workplace exposures and injuries. Pollution controls and various permits and programs are required for many of our operations. Each of our global manufacturing facilities undergoes periodic internal audits relating to environmental, health, and safety requirements and we incur operating and capital costs to improve our facilities or maintain compliance with applicable requirements on an ongoing basis. From time to time, we may be responsible under various state, federal and foreign laws, including CERCLA, for certain costs of investigating and or remediating substances at our current or former sites, and or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties. Liability under CERCLA and analogous state or foreign laws may be imposed without regard to knowledge, fault, or ownership at the time of the disposal or release. Most of our facilities have a history of production operations in the food and drug industry, and some substances used in such production require proper controls in their storage and disposal. We have been named as a "potentially responsible party", or are involved in investigation and remediation, at two third party disposal sites. As of December 31, 2011, management believes that those future site costs which were probable and reasonably estimable, as well as any related accruals, are not material. We are not aware of any pending environmental, health or safety related litigation or significant environmental, health or safety related financial obligations or liabilities arising from current or former operations or properties that are likely to have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Liabilities or obligations, which could require us to make significant expenditures, could arise in the future, however, as the result of, among other things, changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, claims relating to on or off site contamination, or the imposition of unanticipated investigation or cleanup obligations. 28 Table of Contents On November 14, 2011, the Companys subsidiary Mead Johnson & Company, LLC ("MJC") obtained final court approval of a nationwide class settlement with plaintiffs in eight putative consumer class actions that had been consolidated and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The suits all involved allegations of false and misleading advertising with respect to certain Enfamil LIPIL infant formula advertising, and the settlement will resolve all claims in all of the pending suits. In its final order approving the class action settlement (the "Final Order"), the court found the settlement to be fair, reasonable and adequate. The settlement allows consumers who purchased Enfamil LIPIL infant formula between October 13, 2005, and March 31, 2010, to receive infant formula or cash. The amount each consumer can receive depends on how long the consumer purchased the formula; consumers who received their formula through the Women, Infants and Children ("WIC") program are not eligible to participate. The period within which class members could file claims expired on November 25, 2011. As of the close of the claims period, the total amount claimed by class members was less than $8.0 million. As a result and consistent with the Companys previously reported obligations under the settlement agreement, MJC received court approval on January 9, 2012, to distribute the difference between $8.0 million and the total amount claimed in the form of infant formula to Feeding America, the nations largest domestic hunger relief charity. MJC also agreed not to oppose, and the court approved in its Final Order, attorneys fees and expenses to plaintiffs counsel of $3.5 million and $140,000, respectively. As previously reported, MJC agreed to pay costs of notice and settlement administration. Two class members have separately appealed the courts Final Order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Briefing in the appeal has not yet started. Until the appeal has been resolved, distribution of benefits to class members will be delayed. MJC expects distribution of benefits would begin shortly after a successful resolution of the appeal. We record accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Although we cannot predict with certainty the final resolution of these or other lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against it, we do not believe any currently pending legal proceeding to which we are a party will have a material effect on our business or financial condition, although an unfavorable outcome in excess of amounts recognized as of December 31, 2011, with respect to one or more of these proceedings could have a material effect on our results of operations for the periods in which a loss is recognized.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with those statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes to our audited financial statements. Our results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those in "Risk Factors." Overview of Our Business We are a global leader in pediatric nutrition. We are committed to building trusted nutritional brands and products that help improve the health and development of infants and children around the world and provide them with the best start in life. Our comprehensive product portfolio addresses a broad range of nutritional needs for infants, children and expectant and nursing mothers. We have over 100 years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or industry defining products across each of our product categories. We operate in four geographic segments: Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America. Due to similarities in gross margin and other economic attributes, products offered, production process, customer base and regulatory environment, these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Executive Summary Sales increased by 17% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The sales growth was led by our Asia/Latin America segment which grew by 26% and now accounts for 66% of sales. China/Hong Kong continues to lead growth in Asia while Latin Americas percentage growth was in the mid teens, underpinned by exceptional growth in Brazil and Peru. Sales increased by 3% in our North America/Europe segment. In the U.S., higher pricing and market share gains from both a competitors recall and prior and current year product launches were offset in part by declining birth rates and lower consumption. Earnings per share grew 12% in the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales growth of 17% was partially offset by higher demand generation investments, commodity cost increases, higher performance incentives and higher IT and other separation costs. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 % Change 2011 2010 Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 774.1 682.9 13% 21% 22% Interest Expense net 52.2 48.6 7% 1% 2% Earnings before Income Taxes 721.9 634.3 14% 20% 20% Provision for Income Taxes 202.9 176.1 15% 6% 6% Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 28.1% 27.8% Net Earnings 519.0 458.2 13% 14% 15% Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 10.5 5.5 91% 0% 0% Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 508.5 452.7 12% 14% 14% Weighted average Common Shares Diluted 205.0 205.1 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 2.47 $ 2.20 12% The results for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included several items that affect the comparability of our results. These items include significant expenses not indicative of on going results (Specified Items) and are listed in the table below.

Our success in Asia/Latin America comes from share gains and market growth driven by our investments in advertising and promotion, sales force, and product innovation. Our 34 Table of Contents strongest performance in Asia continues to be in China/Hong Kong, primarily reflecting increased market share, market growth, pricing and geographic expansion into additional cities. Latin Americas percentage growth was in the mid teens, underpinned by exceptional growth in Brazil and Peru. The North America/Europe segment was led by our U.S. business with higher pricing and market share gains partially offset by declining birth rates and lower consumption. Market share gains reflected the effects of a competitors 2010 recall and our current and prior year product launches. Volume is expected to decrease in 2012 due to declining birth rates and consumption, the non recurrence of the favorable effects experienced in the first half of 2011 from the competitors recall, and the consequences of unfounded media reports of alleged product contamination at the end of 2011. Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Infant Formula $ 2,188.7 $ 1,945.4 13% Childrens Nutrition 1,394.4 1,119.2 25% Other 93.9 77.0 22% Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% Our sales in North America/Europe are comprised of approximately 90% Infant Formula. Infant Formula sales growth reflected the weighting of the growth rates in Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Growth in Childrens Nutrition reflected the performance in Asia/Latin America. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales is as follows: Years Ended December 31, % of Gross Sales (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Gross Sales $ 4,730.7 $ 4,151.2 100% 100% Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates 700.7 680.8 15% 16% Sales Discounts 149.8 118.4 3% 3% Returns 81.8 84.3 2% 2% Cash Discounts 47.5 44.0 1% 1% Coupons and Other Adjustments 42.4 47.3 1% 1% Prime Vendor Charge Backs 31.5 34.8 0% 1% Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments 1,053.7 1,009.6 22% 24% Total Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 78% 76% Gross to net sales adjustments declined as a percentage of gross sales as U.S. WIC rebates declined as a percentage of global gross sales due to higher growth in the Asia/Latin America segment. 35 Table of Contents Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% Cost of Products Sold 1,362.3 1,149.6 19% Gross Profit $ 2,314.7 $ 1,992.0 16% Gross Margin 63.0% 63.4% The decline in gross margin compared with a year ago is primarily due to higher commodity costs, particularly dairy inputs, partially offset by productivity and higher product pricing.

The performance based compensation increase reflected the phase in of equity awards following our 2009 initial public offering (IPO) and our outstanding financial performance as measured against incentive plan targets and stock performance. Because equity awards are generally expensed over a period of three years, 2011 is the first year in which we had three overlapping grants of these awards. Advertising and Promotion Expenses Our advertising spending primarily includes television and other consumer media. Promotion activities primarily include product trial and education provided to both health care professionals and consumers, where permissible by regulation. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses reflected investments in demand generation activities in support of our strategic growth initiatives. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses reflected our continued investment in our innovation capability and product pipeline. Other Expense/(Income) net (OIE) For the year ended December 31, 2011, OIE included severance and other specified items, pension settlement costs for frozen defined benefit plans, and foreign currency and other gains and losses. In 2011 and 2010, pension settlements were $9.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively. In 2010, $8.5 million of foreign currency losses were recognized in Venezuela due to both the devaluation of the bolivar and the application of highly inflationary accounting. 36 Table of Contents Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe, is reduced by Corporate and Other expenses. Corporate and Other consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses and global business support activities, including research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Asia/Latin America $ 802.9 $ 646.1 24% North America/Europe 317.1 357.7 (11)% Corporate and Other (345.9 ) (320.9 ) 8% EBIT $ 774.1 $ 682.9 13% The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was primarily related to sales growth, partially offset by higher expenses, such as advertising and promotion, sales force growth, the allocation of new outsourced service and system expenses, and performance based compensation. EBIT for North America/Europe decreased due to higher expenses, primarily the allocation of new outsourced service and system expenses, performance based compensation and distribution expense, partially offset by an increase in sales. The new outsourced service and system expenses recorded in the operating segments include new information technology, accounting and procurement services. These new operations replaced similar services provided by the Companys former parent under transitional services agreements; the replaced services have been consistently reflected in Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other expenses increased due to higher IT separation costs. Interest Expense net Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily represented interest incurred on $1.5 billion of notes. The increase in interest expense reflected the termination of our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. The weighted average interest rate on our long term debt, including the impact of the swaps, was 4.0% and 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Income Taxes The ETR remained relatively unchanged at 28.1% and 27.8% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the foregoing reasons, net earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 12% to $508.5 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2010. 37  Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11% Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 682.9 679.6 0% 22% 24% Interest Expense net 48.6 92.6 (48)% 2% 3% Earnings before Income Taxes 634.3 587.0 8% 20% 21% Provision for Income Taxes 176.1 176.4 0% 6% 6% Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 27.8% 30.1% Net Earnings 458.2 410.6 12% 15% 15% Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 5.5 11.0 (50)% 0% 0% Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 452.7 399.6 13% 14% 14% Weighted average Common Shares Diluted 205.1 200.7 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 2.20 $ 1.99 11% The results for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included several items that affect the comparability of our results. These items include significant expenses not indicative of on going results (Specified Items) and are listed in the table below. Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 IT and other separation costs $ 57.1 $ 19.2 Severance and other costs 5.1 25.3 Legal, settlements and related costs 9.2 17.5 IPO related costs 31.0 Gain on asset sale (11.9 ) Specified Items before income taxes $ 71.4 $ 81.1 Income tax impact on items above (25.9 ) (24.4 ) Specified Items after taxes $ 45.5 $ 56.7 Net Sales Our net sales by reportable segments are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, % Change Due to Foreign Exchange (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Volume Price Asia/Latin America $ 1,927.1 $ 1,625.5 19% 10% 6% 3% North America/Europe 1,214.5 1,201.0 1% 0% 0% 1% Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11% 5% 4% 2% Our Asia/Latin America segment continued to have significant sales growth and represented 61% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 58% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our success in Asia/Latin America came from market growth and share gains 38 Table of Contents driven by our investments in advertising and promotion, sales force, and product innovation. The most notable sales gains were achieved in China, Hong Kong, Mexico and Brazil. Our strongest performance continued to be in China, primarily reflecting market growth, increased market share and geographic expansion. The segment was adversely affected by sales declines in Venezuela primarily due to the devaluation of the bolivar. For the year ended December 31, 2010, sales in the North America/Europe segment grew slightly compared with the prior year. The U.S. business improvements from market share gains, due to successful new product launches and a competitors product recall, and lower WIC rebates were offset by the contraction in the U.S. market from lower births. The European business grew due to a 2009 reduction in customer inventory in the European business in preparation for the move from Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) as our primary distributor. Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Infant Formula $ 1,945.4 $ 1,805.6 8% Childrens Nutrition 1,119.2 919.0 22% Other 77.0 101.9 (24)% Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11% Infant formula sales increased 8%, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1%, reflecting results in the North America/Europe segment, which are predominantly infant formula markets, and growth in the Asia/Latin America segment. Childrens nutrition sales increased 22%, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4%, reflecting the strength of the Asia/Latin America segment where over 90% of our children nutrition sales are generated. The decline in other products is primarily driven by the expiration of a 2009 marketing services agreement under which we sold pharmaceutical products in two Asia markets on behalf of BMS. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales is as follows: Years Ended December 31, % of Gross Sales (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Gross Sales $ 4,151.2 $ 3,864.6 100% 100% Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates 680.8 735.7 16% 19% Sales Discounts 118.4 100.4 3% 3% Returns 84.3 72.0 2% 2% Cash Discounts 44.0 45.1 1% 1% Coupons and Other Adjustments 47.3 46.4 1% 1% Prime Vendor Charge Backs 34.8 38.5 1% 1% Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments 1,009.6 1,038.1 24% 27% Total Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 76% 73% Gross to net sales adjustments declined as a percentage of gross sales due to a decline in WIC rebates. The decline in WIC rebates was due to a reduction in the amount of infant formula provided under the program and a reduction in WIC participants due to lower birth rates. 39 Table of Contents Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11% Cost of Products Sold 1,149.6 974.7 18% Gross Profit $ 1,992.0 $ 1,851.8 8% Gross Margin 63.4% 65.5% Gross margin declined compared to a year ago due to increased commodity and manufacturing costs, partially offset by productivity gains and higher product pricing.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses Our advertising spending primarily includes television and other consumer media. Promotion activities primarily include product trial and education provided to both health care professionals and consumers, where permissible by regulation. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses reflected continued investment in demand generation activities in support of our strategic growth initiatives. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses reflected our continued investment in our innovation capability and product pipeline. Other Expense/(Income) net (OIE) For the year ended December 31, 2010, OIE included $10.6 million in pension settlement costs for defined benefit plans, an $8.5 million foreign currency loss from the initial balance sheet remeasurement of our Venezuela subsidiary upon the devaluation of the bolivar and the application of highly inflationary accounting, and severance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, OIE included litigation costs, severance costs, and currency losses on assets held in non functional currencies, partially offset by a gain on sale of a non strategic intangible asset and a favorable patent settlement. 40 Table of Contents Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe, is reduced by Corporate and Other expenses. Corporate and Other consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses and global business support activities, including research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Asia/Latin America $ 646.1 $ 577.0 12% North America/Europe 357.7 391.8 (9)% Corporate and Other (320.9 ) (289.2 ) 11% EBIT $ 682.9 $ 679.6 0% The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was due to sales growth partially offset by increased expenses, primarily higher advertising and promotion costs, along with sales force growth, and a lower gross margin, primarily due to higher commodity and manufacturing costs, partially offset by productivity gains. The decrease in EBIT for North America/Europe was primarily due to a lower gross margin reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing costs, partly offset by productivity gains. Corporate and Other expenses increased due to increased IT and other separation costs, the Shared Service Overlap, new stand alone corporate costs and the absence of a gain in 2009 on the sale of a non strategic intangible asset, partly offset by the elimination of IPO related costs. Interest Expense net Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily represented interest incurred on $1.5 billion of notes. Interest expense declined by $44.0 million due to lower interest rates resulting from our November 2009 debt refinancing, combined with the benefit from fixed to floating interest rate swaps on a portion of that debt, and a reduction in debt. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense primarily represented interest incurred on $1.7 billion of notes. The average interest rate on our long term debt, including the impact of the swaps, was 3.6% and 5.3% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes The ETR for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, was 27.8% and 30.1%, respectively. The difference in the rates was primarily attributable to the benefits of a tax ruling in the Netherlands, managements assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently invested abroad, and a favorable change in our geographic earnings mix. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the foregoing reasons, net earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $452.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2009. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations and available borrowings under our $500.0 million revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our customers and the outflow of cash for raw material purchases, manufacturing, and operating expenses, interest and taxes. Cash flows used in investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures for equipment, buildings and computer software. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily represent proceeds and repayments of short term borrowings, dividend payments and share repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $840.3 million at December 31, 2011 of which $734.0 million was held outside of the United States. Approximately $360 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to reinvest these funds in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, the Company would be required to provide U.S. taxes on these amounts. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements and other relevant factors. Cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $205.7 million, $179.6 million and $102.3 million, respectively. Our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys stock. The repurchase program is primarily intended to offset the dilutive effect on earnings from stock based compensation over the next three years. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we purchased 1.3 million shares under the program for $81.6 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have $218.3 million available under the authorization. Cash Flows We believe that cash on hand, cash from operations, and the available credit facility will be sufficient to support our working capital needs, pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt obligations, fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments. Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating Activities Net Earnings $ 519.0 $ 458.2 $ 410.6 Depreciation and Amortization 75.3 64.7 58.9 Other 8.9 54.3 (13.6 ) Changes in Assets and Liabilities 39.3 (7.5 ) 147.9 Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Contributions (9.7 ) (55.5 ) (27.2 ) Total Operating Activities 632.8 514.2 576.6 Investing Activities (112.6 ) (174.6 ) (81.3 ) Financing Activities (275.2 ) (306.4 ) 49.1 Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Cash and Cash Equivalents (0.3 ) 1.3 16.7 Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 244.7 $ 34.5 $ 561.1 42  Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Cash flow provided from operating activities increased by $118.6 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher earnings, along with lower cash paid for income taxes, lower cash contributions to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan and higher accounts payable were partially offset by increased inventories and receivables. The 2011 increase in inventories included an advance purchase of approximately $80 million for select dairy inputs along with a corresponding increase in accounts payable. Cash flow used in investing activities decreased $62.0 million in 2011 compared to 2010. 2010 included expenditures for new packaging lines and higher spending for investments in our global IT platform. Cash flow used in financing activities was $275.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily from dividend payments of $205.7 million and treasury stock repurchases of $87.7 million. The termination of interest rate swaps provided $23.5 million to cash flow from financing activities. Cash flow used in financing activities was $306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and reflected dividend payments of $179.6 million and the net repayment of $120.0 million of our short term Credit Facility borrowing. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Cash flow from operating activities fell by $62.4 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Higher earnings, along with increased non cash depreciation and amortization expense, were more than offset by a smaller reduction in working capital and other short term assets and liabilities, along with increased cash contributions to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Cash flow used in investing activities increased $93.3 million primarily due to higher capital spending from investments in our global IT platform and new packaging lines. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2010 included a $5.5 million investment in International Pediatric Nutrition Company, our joint venture with Almarai Company in Saudi Arabia serving countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Cash flow used in financing activities was $306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily from $179.6 million of dividend payments and the net repayment of $120.0 million of borrowing under our short term Credit Facility. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and reflected $1,495.3 million from the private placement of notes and $782.3 million net cash proceeds from the IPO, partially offset by $2,348.1 million repayment of BMS debt and other items. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures and the cash outflow for capital expenditures were as follows: (In millions) Capital expenditures Cash outflow for capital expenditures Year ended December 31, 2011 $ 121.6 $ 109.5 Year ended December 31, 2010 143.4 172.4 Year ended December 31, 2009 122.3 95.8 Capital expenditures included investments in our global IT platform, new packaging lines, and research and development capabilities. In December 2011, we announced a planned capital expenditure for a new, greenfield spray dryer and technology center in Singapore that will cost approximately $300 million over a three year period. We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $220 million, including approximately 43 Table of Contents $100 million for the first year of the planned capital expenditure in Singapore, and continued emphasis on investment in growth and innovation. The Company expects to fund capital expenditures from its operations. Short Term Borrowings In June 2011, the Company entered into a five year revolving credit facility agreement (2011 Credit Facility). The 2011 Credit Facility replaces the Companys three year revolving credit facility agreement dated February 17, 2009 (2009 Credit Facility). Borrowings from the 2011 Credit Facility are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The 2011 Credit Facility is unsecured and repayable on maturity in June 2016, and subject to annual extensions if a sufficient number of lenders agree. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit permitted at any one time under the 2011 Credit Facility is $500.0 million, which may be increased from time to time up to $750.0 million at the Companys request and with the consent of the lenders, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants applicable to limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants whereby the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) cannot exceed 3.25 to 1.0, and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense cannot be less than 3.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2011. Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility bear interest at a rate that is determined as a base rate plus a margin. The base rate is either (a) LIBOR for a specified interest period, or (b) a floating rate based upon JPMorgan Chase Banks prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR. The margin is determined by reference to the Companys credit rating. The margin can range from 0.075% to 1.45% over the base rate. In addition, the Company incurs an annual 0.2% facility fee on the entire facility commitment of $500.0 million. If our corporate credit rating falls below (i) Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and (ii) BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Service (S&P), then Mead Johnson & Company shall automatically be deemed to guarantee the obligations under the Credit Facility. The Moodys credit rating for MJN is currently Baa1. S&Ps credit rating for MJN is currently BBB. There were no short term borrowings as of December 31, 2011. Long Term Debt The components of our long term debt are detailed in the table below: Description Principal Amount Interest Rate Terms 2014 Notes $500.0 million 3.50% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2014 2019 Notes $700.0 million 4.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2019 2039 Notes $300.0 million 5.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2039 The notes may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of par value or an amount calculated based upon the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments. Upon a change of control, we may be required to repurchase the notes 44 Table of Contents in an amount equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In November 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700.0 million. In November 2010, the Company terminated a notional amount of $200.0 million in interest rate swaps on our 2019 Notes for cash of $15.6 million. In July 2011, we terminated the remaining notional amount of $500.0 million in interest rate swaps on our 2014 Notes for cash of $23.5 million. The related basis adjustments of the underlying hedged items are being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt. For additional information on our long term debt and interest rate swaps, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2011, our contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows: Payments due by December 31, (In millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Operating lease obligations $ 33.5 $ 26.9 $ 22.2 $ 16.5 $ 14.9 $ 26.8 $ 140.8 Capital lease obligations 1.1 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.4 3.7 Purchase obligations 108.4 60.3 58.1 55.3 46.8 131.2 460.1 Long term debt 500.0 1,000.0 1,500.0 Interest on long term debt 69.5 69.5 69.5 52.0 52.0 510.0 822.5 Total $ 212.5 $ 157.6 $ 650.5 $ 124.4 $ 114.1 $ 1,668.0 $ 2,927.1 Our operating lease obligations are generally related to real estate leases for offices, manufacturing related leases, and vehicle leases. Capital lease obligations relate to assets used for interplant transportation of materials and finished goods. Purchase obligations are for unconditional commitments related to a master service agreement with IBM for information technology, accounting and indirect procurement services; for the purchase of materials used in manufacturing; and for promotional services. The future interest payments on long term debt are based on coupon payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement with BMS, we agreed to indemnify BMS for (i) any tax payable with respect to any separate tax return that we are required to file or cause to be filed, (ii) any tax incurred as a result of any gain that may be recognized by a member of the BMS affiliated group with respect to a transfer of certain foreign affiliates by us in preparation for the IPO, and (iii) any tax arising from the failure or breach of any representation or covenant made by us which failure or breach results in the intended tax consequences of the split off transaction not being achieved. We do not use off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge or partially hedge interest rate exposure nor do we maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions or other financial or investment purposes. Significant Accounting Estimates In presenting our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. 45 Table of Contents Some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an on going basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the significant accounting estimates listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. For information on our accounting policies, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser. Revenues are reduced at the time of recognition to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience and business trends. Additionally, provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for discounts, WIC rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We offer sales incentives to customers and consumers through various programs consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons. Provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for these items based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. WIC Rebates We participate on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, we reimburse these entities for the difference between our wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. We account for WIC contract rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. We consider levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts and WIC participation, and adjust the accrual periodically throughout the year to reflect actual expense. WIC rebate accruals were $210.1 million and $195.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Rebates under the WIC program reduced revenues by $700.7 million, $680.8 million, and $735.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales Returns We account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. We determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns such as discontinuations and new product introductions. Sales return accruals were $43.0 million and $43.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Returns reduced sales by $81.8 million, $84.3 million, and $72.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including tax rulings, managements assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently 46 Table of Contents invested abroad and managements estimate of appropriate reserves against uncertain tax positions. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty in tax positions. The income tax provision prepared in the post split off period reflects a separate return methodology based on the legal structure where we are a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions. The income tax provision prepared in the period following the IPO but preceding the split off reflects a separate return methodology based on the actual legal entity structure as if we were a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions with certain accommodations pursuant to a tax matters agreement as noted below. This is in contrast to the pre IPO period in which the income tax provision was prepared on a separate return stand alone methodology reflecting a hypothetical legal entity structure in which we were included in the tax grouping of other BMS entities within the respective entitys tax jurisdiction. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable earnings in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The ultimate liability incurred by us may differ from the provision estimates based on a number of factors, including interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long range forecast of future taxable earnings and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Changes in uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but are not expected to be material to our financial position. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Our pension plans and post retirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Management, in consultation with our actuaries, is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, long term returns on plan assets, retirement, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and post retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate and expected long term returns on plan assets. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The discount rate assumptions used to value the pension and post retirement benefit obligations reflect the yield to maturity of high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts. In developing the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long term historical returns on the asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of the asset classes. 47 Table of Contents Our principal pension plan is the Mead Johnson & Company Retirement Plan in the United States (U.S. Pension Plan), which is a frozen plan and represents approximately 80% of the Companys total pension assets and obligations. The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year are established at the beginning of the plan year and the assumptions used to determine benefit obligation are established as of the balance sheet date. The key assumptions for the U.S. Pension Plan were as follows: Used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.50% 5.75% Expected long term return on plan assets 7.75% 7.72% Used to determine benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 2010 Discount rate 3.75% 5.50% The obligation for the U.S. Pension Plan grew by $74.8 million during 2011, primarily due to the change in the discount rate and the timing of expected payment assumptions. The change in the discount rate assumption reflected both the assumption used for the timing of expected payments and lower corporate bond rates. The following table shows the impact on pension expense of hypothetical changes in the rates assumed for the U.S. pension plan: Increase/(Decrease) in Expense Increase/(Decrease) in Obligation (Dollars in millions) Change in Rate Increase in Rate Decrease in Rate Increase in Rate Decrease in Rate Impact of change in rates: Discount rate +/ 100 basis points $ 0.7 $ (1.0 ) $ (23.2 ) $ 27.3 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets +/ 100 basis points $ (2.0 ) $ 2.0 N/A N/A See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on our pension and post retirement benefits. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain "forward looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "may," "project," "guidance," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors," that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement. 48  Table of Contents Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, we can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in forward looking statements can be achieved and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our on going business operations. In addition to our costs for materials, compensation, media, distribution and other purchased services being subject to inflationary pressures, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. To reduce our exposure to these risks, we use a variety of contract techniques and financial instruments as described below. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary net foreign currency exposures are the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, the euro, the Malaysian ringitt, the Mexican peso, the Philippine peso, and the Canadian dollar. In addition to these primary exposures, as a global business, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk in all countries in which we do business whose local reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income(loss) and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings. The foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of $2.9 million, $7.8 million, and $5.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not significant. We enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available. The intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments. The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures and the total notional amount of these contracts was $134.3 million at December 31, 2011, representing a fair value asset of $5.1 million. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of December 31, 2011: Contract Amount (in millions) Average Contractual Exchange Rate Receive United States dollar/Pay Canadian dollar $ 31.9 1.01 Receive United States dollar/Pay Mexican peso $ 62.5 13.07 Receive United States dollar/Pay Philippine peso $ 39.9 43.71 49 Table of Contents All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions and mature within 12 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the fair value would have changed by $14.3 million and would have switched to a payable position. The unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Commodity Risk We purchase certain products in the normal course of business, including dairy, agricultural oils, and packaging materials, the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes. Therefore, we are exposed to price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to reduce volatility. Generally, these techniques include unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time, timing of purchases, and setting fixed prices with suppliers. We do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, partially because of these contract pricing techniques. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. Primary exposures include movements in U.S Treasury rates, LIBOR, and commercial paper rates. The nature and amount of our short term and long term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our debt obligations totaled $1.5 billion. For information on our debt obligations, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The Company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2011. For information on interest rate swap activity, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 50  Table of Contents  
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with those statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes to our audited financial statements. Our results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those in "Risk Factors." Overview of Our Business We are a global leader in pediatric nutrition. We are committed to building trusted nutritional brands and products that help improve the health and development of infants and children around the world and provide them with the best start in life. Our comprehensive product portfolio addresses a broad range of nutritional needs for infants, children and expectant and nursing mothers. We have over 100 years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or industry defining products across each of our product categories. We operate in four geographic segments: Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America. Due to similarities in gross margin and other economic attributes, products offered, production process, customer base and regulatory environment, these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Executive Summary Sales increased by 17% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The sales growth was led by our Asia/Latin America segment which grew by 26% and now accounts for 66% of sales. China/Hong Kong continues to lead growth in Asia while Latin Americas percentage growth was in the mid teens, underpinned by exceptional growth in Brazil and Peru. Sales increased by 3% in our North America/Europe segment. In the U.S., higher pricing and market share gains from both a competitors recall and prior and current year product launches were offset in part by declining birth rates and lower consumption. Earnings per share grew 12% in the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales growth of 17% was partially offset by higher demand generation investments, commodity cost increases, higher performance incentives and higher IT and other separation costs. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 % Change 2011 2010 Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 774.1 682.9 13% 21% 22% Interest Expense net 52.2 48.6 7% 1% 2% Earnings before Income Taxes 721.9 634.3 14% 20% 20% Provision for Income Taxes 202.9 176.1 15% 6% 6% Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 28.1% 27.8% Net Earnings 519.0 458.2 13% 14% 15% Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 10.5 5.5 91% 0% 0% Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 508.5 452.7 12% 14% 14% Weighted average Common Shares Diluted 205.0 205.1 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 2.47 $ 2.20 12% The results for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included several items that affect the comparability of our results. These items include significant expenses not indicative of on going results (Specified Items) and are listed in the table below. Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 IT and other separation costs $ 74.7 $ 57.1 Severance and other costs 11.6 5.1 Legal, settlements and related costs 7.6 9.2 Specified Items before income taxes $ 93.9 $ 71.4 Income tax impact on items above (29.3 ) (25.9 ) Specified Items after taxes $ 64.6 $ 45.5 Net Sales Our net sales by reportable segments are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, % Change Due to Foreign Exchange (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Volume Price Asia/Latin America $ 2,423.2 $ 1,927.1 26% 17% 5% 4% North America/Europe 1,253.8 1,214.5 3% 2% 1% 0% Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% 11% 3% 3% Our Asia/Latin America segment continues to have significant sales growth and represented 66% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with 61% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our success in Asia/Latin America comes from share gains and market growth driven by our investments in advertising and promotion, sales force, and product innovation. Our 34 Table of Contents strongest performance in Asia continues to be in China/Hong Kong, primarily reflecting increased market share, market growth, pricing and geographic expansion into additional cities. Latin Americas percentage growth was in the mid teens, underpinned by exceptional growth in Brazil and Peru. The North America/Europe segment was led by our U.S. business with higher pricing and market share gains partially offset by declining birth rates and lower consumption. Market share gains reflected the effects of a competitors 2010 recall and our current and prior year product launches. Volume is expected to decrease in 2012 due to declining birth rates and consumption, the non recurrence of the favorable effects experienced in the first half of 2011 from the competitors recall, and the consequences of unfounded media reports of alleged product contamination at the end of 2011. Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Infant Formula $ 2,188.7 $ 1,945.4 13% Childrens Nutrition 1,394.4 1,119.2 25% Other 93.9 77.0 22% Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% Our sales in North America/Europe are comprised of approximately 90% Infant Formula. Infant Formula sales growth reflected the weighting of the growth rates in Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe. Growth in Childrens Nutrition reflected the performance in Asia/Latin America. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales is as follows: Years Ended December 31, % of Gross Sales (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Gross Sales $ 4,730.7 $ 4,151.2 100% 100% Gross to Net Sales Adjustments WIC Rebates 700.7 680.8 15% 16% Sales Discounts 149.8 118.4 3% 3% Returns 81.8 84.3 2% 2% Cash Discounts 47.5 44.0 1% 1% Coupons and Other Adjustments 42.4 47.3 1% 1% Prime Vendor Charge Backs 31.5 34.8 0% 1% Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments 1,053.7 1,009.6 22% 24% Total Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 78% 76% Gross to net sales adjustments declined as a percentage of gross sales as U.S. WIC rebates declined as a percentage of global gross sales due to higher growth in the Asia/Latin America segment. 35 Table of Contents Gross Profit Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Net Sales $ 3,677.0 $ 3,141.6 17% Cost of Products Sold 1,362.3 1,149.6 19% Gross Profit $ 2,314.7 $ 1,992.0 16% Gross Margin 63.0% 63.4% The decline in gross margin compared with a year ago is primarily due to higher commodity costs, particularly dairy inputs, partially offset by productivity and higher product pricing.

The performance based compensation increase reflected the phase in of equity awards following our 2009 initial public offering (IPO) and our outstanding financial performance as measured against incentive plan targets and stock performance. Because equity awards are generally expensed over a period of three years, 2011 is the first year in which we had three overlapping grants of these awards. Advertising and Promotion Expenses Our advertising spending primarily includes television and other consumer media. Promotion activities primarily include product trial and education provided to both health care professionals and consumers, where permissible by regulation. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses reflected investments in demand generation activities in support of our strategic growth initiatives. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses reflected our continued investment in our innovation capability and product pipeline. Other Expense/(Income) net (OIE) For the year ended December 31, 2011, OIE included severance and other specified items, pension settlement costs for frozen defined benefit plans, and foreign currency and other gains and losses. In 2011 and 2010, pension settlements were $9.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively. In 2010, $8.5 million of foreign currency losses were recognized in Venezuela due to both the devaluation of the bolivar and the application of highly inflationary accounting. 36 Table of Contents Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe, is reduced by Corporate and Other expenses. Corporate and Other consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses and global business support activities, including research and development, marketing and supply chain costs. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Asia/Latin America $ 802.9 $ 646.1 24% North America/Europe 317.1 357.7 (11)% Corporate and Other (345.9 ) (320.9 ) 8% EBIT $ 774.1 $ 682.9 13% The increase in EBIT for Asia/Latin America was primarily related to sales growth, partially offset by higher expenses, such as advertising and promotion, sales force growth, the allocation of new outsourced service and system expenses, and performance based compensation. EBIT for North America/Europe decreased due to higher expenses, primarily the allocation of new outsourced service and system expenses, performance based compensation and distribution expense, partially offset by an increase in sales. The new outsourced service and system expenses recorded in the operating segments include new information technology, accounting and procurement services. These new operations replaced similar services provided by the Companys former parent under transitional services agreements; the replaced services have been consistently reflected in Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other expenses increased due to higher IT separation costs. Interest Expense net Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily represented interest incurred on $1.5 billion of notes. The increase in interest expense reflected the termination of our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. The weighted average interest rate on our long term debt, including the impact of the swaps, was 4.0% and 3.6% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Income Taxes The ETR remained relatively unchanged at 28.1% and 27.8% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the foregoing reasons, net earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 12% to $508.5 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2010. 37  Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: % of Net Sales (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11% Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes (EBIT) 682.9 679.6 0% 22% 24% Interest Expense net 48.6 92.6 (48)% 2% 3% Earnings before Income Taxes 634.3 587.0 8% 20% 21% Provision for Income Taxes 176.1 176.4 0% 6% 6% Effective Tax Rate (ETR) 27.8% 30.1% Net Earnings 458.2 410.6 12% 15% 15% Less: Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 5.5 11.0 (50)% 0% 0% Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders 452.7 399.6 13% 14% 14% Weighted average Common Shares Diluted 205.1 200.7 Earnings per Common Share Diluted $ 2.20 $ 1.99 11% The results for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included several items that affect the comparability of our results.

Our success in Asia/Latin America came from market growth and share gains 38 Table of Contents driven by our investments in advertising and promotion, sales force, and product innovation. The most notable sales gains were achieved in China, Hong Kong, Mexico and Brazil. Our strongest performance continued to be in China, primarily reflecting market growth, increased market share and geographic expansion. The segment was adversely affected by sales declines in Venezuela primarily due to the devaluation of the bolivar. For the year ended December 31, 2010, sales in the North America/Europe segment grew slightly compared with the prior year. The U.S. business improvements from market share gains, due to successful new product launches and a competitors product recall, and lower WIC rebates were offset by the contraction in the U.S. market from lower births. The European business grew due to a 2009 reduction in customer inventory in the European business in preparation for the move from Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) as our primary distributor. Our net sales by product category are shown in the table below: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Infant Formula $ 1,945.4 $ 1,805.6 8% Childrens Nutrition 1,119.2 919.0 22% Other 77.0 101.9 (24)% Net Sales $ 3,141.6 $ 2,826.5 11% Infant formula sales increased 8%, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1%, reflecting results in the North America/Europe segment, which are predominantly infant formula markets, and growth in the Asia/Latin America segment. Childrens nutrition sales increased 22%, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4%, reflecting the strength of the Asia/Latin America segment where over 90% of our children nutrition sales are generated. The decline in other products is primarily driven by the expiration of a 2009 marketing services agreement under which we sold pharmaceutical products in two Asia markets on behalf of BMS. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses Our advertising spending primarily includes television and other consumer media. Promotion activities primarily include product trial and education provided to both health care professionals and consumers, where permissible by regulation. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses reflected continued investment in demand generation activities in support of our strategic growth initiatives. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses reflected our continued investment in our innovation capability and product pipeline. Other Expense/(Income) net (OIE) For the year ended December 31, 2010, OIE included $10.6 million in pension settlement costs for defined benefit plans, an $8.5 million foreign currency loss from the initial balance sheet remeasurement of our Venezuela subsidiary upon the devaluation of the bolivar and the application of highly inflationary accounting, and severance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, OIE included litigation costs, severance costs, and currency losses on assets held in non functional currencies, partially offset by a gain on sale of a non strategic intangible asset and a favorable patent settlement. 40 Table of Contents Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes EBIT from our two reportable segments, Asia/Latin America and North America/Europe, is reduced by Corporate and Other expenses. Corporate and Other consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses and global business support activities, including research and development, marketing and supply chain costs.

The decrease in EBIT for North America/Europe was primarily due to a lower gross margin reflecting higher commodity and manufacturing costs, partly offset by productivity gains. Corporate and Other expenses increased due to increased IT and other separation costs, the Shared Service Overlap, new stand alone corporate costs and the absence of a gain in 2009 on the sale of a non strategic intangible asset, partly offset by the elimination of IPO related costs. Interest Expense net Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily represented interest incurred on $1.5 billion of notes. Interest expense declined by $44.0 million due to lower interest rates resulting from our November 2009 debt refinancing, combined with the benefit from fixed to floating interest rate swaps on a portion of that debt, and a reduction in debt. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense primarily represented interest incurred on $1.7 billion of notes. The average interest rate on our long term debt, including the impact of the swaps, was 3.6% and 5.3% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes The ETR for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, was 27.8% and 30.1%, respectively. The difference in the rates was primarily attributable to the benefits of a tax ruling in the Netherlands, managements assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently invested abroad, and a favorable change in our geographic earnings mix. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests consisted of an 11% interest in our China legal entity and a 10% interest in our Indonesia legal entity held by third parties. Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders For the foregoing reasons, net earnings attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $452.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2009. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations and available borrowings under our $500.0 million revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our customers and the outflow of cash for raw material purchases, manufacturing, and operating expenses, interest and taxes. Cash flows used in investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures for equipment, buildings and computer software. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily represent proceeds and repayments of short term borrowings, dividend payments and share repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $840.3 million at December 31, 2011 of which $734.0 million was held outside of the United States. Approximately $360 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to reinvest these funds in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, the Company would be required to provide U.S. taxes on these amounts. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements and other relevant factors. Cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $205.7 million, $179.6 million and $102.3 million, respectively. Our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys stock. The repurchase program is primarily intended to offset the dilutive effect on earnings from stock based compensation over the next three years. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we purchased 1.3 million shares under the program for $81.6 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have $218.3 million available under the authorization. Cash Flows We believe that cash on hand, cash from operations, and the available credit facility will be sufficient to support our working capital needs, pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt obligations, fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments. Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating Activities Net Earnings $ 519.0 $ 458.2 $ 410.6 Depreciation and Amortization 75.3 64.7 58.9 Other 8.9 54.3 (13.6 ) Changes in Assets and Liabilities 39.3 (7.5 ) 147.9 Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Contributions (9.7 ) (55.5 ) (27.2 ) Total Operating Activities 632.8 514.2 576.6 Investing Activities (112.6 ) (174.6 ) (81.3 ) Financing Activities (275.2 ) (306.4 ) 49.1 Effects of Changes in Exchange Rates on Cash and Cash Equivalents (0.3 ) 1.3 16.7 Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 244.7 $ 34.5 $ 561.1 42  Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Cash flow provided from operating activities increased by $118.6 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher earnings, along with lower cash paid for income taxes, lower cash contributions to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan and higher accounts payable were partially offset by increased inventories and receivables. The 2011 increase in inventories included an advance purchase of approximately $80 million for select dairy inputs along with a corresponding increase in accounts payable. Cash flow used in investing activities decreased $62.0 million in 2011 compared to 2010. 2010 included expenditures for new packaging lines and higher spending for investments in our global IT platform. Cash flow used in financing activities was $275.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily from dividend payments of $205.7 million and treasury stock repurchases of $87.7 million. The termination of interest rate swaps provided $23.5 million to cash flow from financing activities. Cash flow used in financing activities was $306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and reflected dividend payments of $179.6 million and the net repayment of $120.0 million of our short term Credit Facility borrowing. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Cash flow from operating activities fell by $62.4 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Higher earnings, along with increased non cash depreciation and amortization expense, were more than offset by a smaller reduction in working capital and other short term assets and liabilities, along with increased cash contributions to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Cash flow used in investing activities increased $93.3 million primarily due to higher capital spending from investments in our global IT platform and new packaging lines. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2010 included a $5.5 million investment in International Pediatric Nutrition Company, our joint venture with Almarai Company in Saudi Arabia serving countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Cash flow used in financing activities was $306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily from $179.6 million of dividend payments and the net repayment of $120.0 million of borrowing under our short term Credit Facility. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and reflected $1,495.3 million from the private placement of notes and $782.3 million net cash proceeds from the IPO, partially offset by $2,348.1 million repayment of BMS debt and other items. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures and the cash outflow for capital expenditures were as follows: (In millions) Capital expenditures Cash outflow for capital expenditures Year ended December 31, 2011 $ 121.6 $ 109.5 Year ended December 31, 2010 143.4 172.4 Year ended December 31, 2009 122.3 95.8 Capital expenditures included investments in our global IT platform, new packaging lines, and research and development capabilities. In December 2011, we announced a planned capital expenditure for a new, greenfield spray dryer and technology center in Singapore that will cost approximately $300 million over a three year period. We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $220 million, including approximately 43 Table of Contents $100 million for the first year of the planned capital expenditure in Singapore, and continued emphasis on investment in growth and innovation. The Company expects to fund capital expenditures from its operations. Short Term Borrowings In June 2011, the Company entered into a five year revolving credit facility agreement (2011 Credit Facility). The 2011 Credit Facility replaces the Companys three year revolving credit facility agreement dated February 17, 2009 (2009 Credit Facility). Borrowings from the 2011 Credit Facility are to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The 2011 Credit Facility is unsecured and repayable on maturity in June 2016, and subject to annual extensions if a sufficient number of lenders agree. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit permitted at any one time under the 2011 Credit Facility is $500.0 million, which may be increased from time to time up to $750.0 million at the Companys request and with the consent of the lenders, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants applicable to limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants whereby the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) cannot exceed 3.25 to 1.0, and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense cannot be less than 3.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2011. Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility bear interest at a rate that is determined as a base rate plus a margin. The base rate is either (a) LIBOR for a specified interest period, or (b) a floating rate based upon JPMorgan Chase Banks prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR. The margin is determined by reference to the Companys credit rating. The margin can range from 0.075% to 1.45% over the base rate. In addition, the Company incurs an annual 0.2% facility fee on the entire facility commitment of $500.0 million. If our corporate credit rating falls below (i) Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and (ii) BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Service (S&P), then Mead Johnson & Company shall automatically be deemed to guarantee the obligations under the Credit Facility. The Moodys credit rating for MJN is currently Baa1. S&Ps credit rating for MJN is currently BBB. There were no short term borrowings as of December 31, 2011. Long Term Debt The components of our long term debt are detailed in the table below: Description Principal Amount Interest Rate Terms 2014 Notes $500.0 million 3.50% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2014 2019 Notes $700.0 million 4.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2019 2039 Notes $300.0 million 5.90% fixed Interest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 1, 2039 The notes may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of par value or an amount calculated based upon the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments. Upon a change of control, we may be required to repurchase the notes 44 Table of Contents in an amount equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In November 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700.0 million. In November 2010, the Company terminated a notional amount of $200.0 million in interest rate swaps on our 2019 Notes for cash of $15.6 million. In July 2011, we terminated the remaining notional amount of $500.0 million in interest rate swaps on our 2014 Notes for cash of $23.5 million. The related basis adjustments of the underlying hedged items are being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt. For additional information on our long term debt and interest rate swaps, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2011, our contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows: Payments due by December 31, (In millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Operating lease obligations $ 33.5 $ 26.9 $ 22.2 $ 16.5 $ 14.9 $ 26.8 $ 140.8 Capital lease obligations 1.1 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.4 3.7 Purchase obligations 108.4 60.3 58.1 55.3 46.8 131.2 460.1 Long term debt 500.0 1,000.0 1,500.0 Interest on long term debt 69.5 69.5 69.5 52.0 52.0 510.0 822.5 Total $ 212.5 $ 157.6 $ 650.5 $ 124.4 $ 114.1 $ 1,668.0 $ 2,927.1 Our operating lease obligations are generally related to real estate leases for offices, manufacturing related leases, and vehicle leases. Capital lease obligations relate to assets used for interplant transportation of materials and finished goods. Purchase obligations are for unconditional commitments related to a master service agreement with IBM for information technology, accounting and indirect procurement services; for the purchase of materials used in manufacturing; and for promotional services. The future interest payments on long term debt are based on coupon payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Tax Matters Agreement with BMS, we agreed to indemnify BMS for (i) any tax payable with respect to any separate tax return that we are required to file or cause to be filed, (ii) any tax incurred as a result of any gain that may be recognized by a member of the BMS affiliated group with respect to a transfer of certain foreign affiliates by us in preparation for the IPO, and (iii) any tax arising from the failure or breach of any representation or covenant made by us which failure or breach results in the intended tax consequences of the split off transaction not being achieved. We do not use off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge or partially hedge interest rate exposure nor do we maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions or other financial or investment purposes. Significant Accounting Estimates In presenting our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. 45 Table of Contents Some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. On an on going basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the significant accounting estimates listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. For information on our accounting policies, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser. Revenues are reduced at the time of recognition to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience and business trends. Additionally, provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for discounts, WIC rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. We offer sales incentives to customers and consumers through various programs consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons. Provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for these items based on historical experience, updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue. WIC Rebates We participate on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, we reimburse these entities for the difference between our wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. We account for WIC contract rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. We consider levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts and WIC participation, and adjust the accrual periodically throughout the year to reflect actual expense. WIC rebate accruals were $210.1 million and $195.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Rebates under the WIC program reduced revenues by $700.7 million, $680.8 million, and $735.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales Returns We account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. We determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns such as discontinuations and new product introductions. Sales return accruals were $43.0 million and $43.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet. Returns reduced sales by $81.8 million, $84.3 million, and $72.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including tax rulings, managements assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently 46 Table of Contents invested abroad and managements estimate of appropriate reserves against uncertain tax positions. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty in tax positions. The income tax provision prepared in the post split off period reflects a separate return methodology based on the legal structure where we are a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions. The income tax provision prepared in the period following the IPO but preceding the split off reflects a separate return methodology based on the actual legal entity structure as if we were a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions with certain accommodations pursuant to a tax matters agreement as noted below. This is in contrast to the pre IPO period in which the income tax provision was prepared on a separate return stand alone methodology reflecting a hypothetical legal entity structure in which we were included in the tax grouping of other BMS entities within the respective entitys tax jurisdiction. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable earnings in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The ultimate liability incurred by us may differ from the provision estimates based on a number of factors, including interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long range forecast of future taxable earnings and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Changes in uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but are not expected to be material to our financial position. Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Our pension plans and post retirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Management, in consultation with our actuaries, is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, long term returns on plan assets, retirement, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and post retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate and expected long term returns on plan assets. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The discount rate assumptions used to value the pension and post retirement benefit obligations reflect the yield to maturity of high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts. In developing the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long term historical returns on the asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of the asset classes. 47 Table of Contents Our principal pension plan is the Mead Johnson & Company Retirement Plan in the United States (U.S. Pension Plan), which is a frozen plan and represents approximately 80% of the Companys total pension assets and obligations. The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year are established at the beginning of the plan year and the assumptions used to determine benefit obligation are established as of the balance sheet date. The key assumptions for the U.S. Pension Plan were as follows: Used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.50% 5.75% Expected long term return on plan assets 7.75% 7.72% Used to determine benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 2010 Discount rate 3.75% 5.50% The obligation for the U.S. Pension Plan grew by $74.8 million during 2011, primarily due to the change in the discount rate and the timing of expected payment assumptions. The change in the discount rate assumption reflected both the assumption used for the timing of expected payments and lower corporate bond rates. The following table shows the impact on pension expense of hypothetical changes in the rates assumed for the U.S. pension plan: Increase/(Decrease) in Expense Increase/(Decrease) in Obligation (Dollars in millions) Change in Rate Increase in Rate Decrease in Rate Increase in Rate Decrease in Rate Impact of change in rates: Discount rate +/ 100 basis points $ 0.7 $ (1.0 ) $ (23.2 ) $ 27.3 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets +/ 100 basis points $ (2.0 ) $ 2.0 N/A N/A See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on our pension and post retirement benefits. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain "forward looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "may," "project," "guidance," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors," that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement. 48  Table of Contents Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, we can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in forward looking statements can be achieved and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our on going business operations. In addition to our costs for materials, compensation, media, distribution and other purchased services being subject to inflationary pressures, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. To reduce our exposure to these risks, we use a variety of contract techniques and financial instruments as described below. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary net foreign currency exposures are the Chinese renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar, the euro, the Malaysian ringitt, the Mexican peso, the Philippine peso, and the Canadian dollar. In addition to these primary exposures, as a global business, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk in all countries in which we do business whose local reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income(loss) and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings. The foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of $2.9 million, $7.8 million, and $5.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not significant. We enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available. The intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. While we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities, our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments. The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures and the total notional amount of these contracts was $134.3 million at December 31, 2011, representing a fair value asset of $5.1 million. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of December 31, 2011: Contract Amount (in millions) Average Contractual Exchange Rate Receive United States dollar/Pay Canadian dollar $ 31.9 1.01 Receive United States dollar/Pay Mexican peso $ 62.5 13.07 Receive United States dollar/Pay Philippine peso $ 39.9 43.71 49 Table of Contents All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions and mature within 12 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the fair value would have changed by $14.3 million and would have switched to a payable position. The unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Commodity Risk We purchase certain products in the normal course of business, including dairy, agricultural oils, and packaging materials, the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes. Therefore, we are exposed to price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. We employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to reduce volatility. Generally, these techniques include unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time, timing of purchases, and setting fixed prices with suppliers. We do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, partially because of these contract pricing techniques. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. Primary exposures include movements in U.S Treasury rates, LIBOR, and commercial paper rates. The nature and amount of our short term and long term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our debt obligations totaled $1.5 billion. For information on our debt obligations, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The Company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2011. For information on interest rate swap activity, see Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 50  Table of Contents
