Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (MMC) is a global professional services firm. MMCs subsidiaries include Marsh Inc. (Marsh), the worlds leading risk and insurance services firm; Kroll Inc. (Kroll), the worlds leading risk consulting company; Mercer Inc. (Mercer), a major global provider of human resource and specialty consulting services; and Putnam Investments (Putnam), one of the largest investment management companies in the United States. MMCs approximately 55,000 employees worldwide provide analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in over 100 countries. MMC operates in four principal business segments based on the services provided. Risk and Insurance Services includes risk management and insurance and reinsurance broking and services, provided primarily by Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Risk Consulting and Technology, conducted through Kroll, includes risk consulting and related investigative, intelligence, financial, security and technology services. Consulting, which comprises the activities of Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Mercers Specialty Consulting Businesses, includes human resource consulting and related services, and specialized management and economic consulting services. We conduct Investment Management through Putnam. A fuller description of our segments business activities is included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment below, in our discussion of segment financial results. Management evaluates performance based on segment operating income, which is after deductions for directly related expenses, but not MMC corporate level expenses. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The accounting policies used for each segment are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements. This MD&A contains forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements at the outset of this report. Significant Developments in 2005 2005 was a year of transition for MMC. MMCs historical financial information should be viewed in light of the significant developments discussed below. New Business Model in Risk and Insurance Services Since 2004, MMC has made significant changes to its business model. Our new business model has three main aspects: a commitment to make all fees and other remuneration earned by MMC for the placement of insurance coverage fully transparent to our clients in the U.S. and in major markets around the world; the elimination of contingent compensation or market services agreements with insurers; and an initiative to offset, to the extent possible, lost market services revenue by increasing brokerage commissions and fees. 29 During 2005, MMC made significant progress implementing the requirements of the settlement agreement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) and the New York State Insurance Department (NYSID). We developed and rolled out compliance infrastructure and governance processes; developed and rolled out transparency standards and related policies and procedures; trained employees in core and certain specialty business lines; and established compliance monitoring groups to measure compliance. While Marsh is the MMC subsidiary most directly affected by these settlement related activities, Guy Carpenter and Mercers health and benefits practices are also affected. MMCs revenue in 2005 was impacted by a $417 million decrease in market services revenue. In 2005, market services revenue of $124 million, related to insurance placements made prior to October 1, 2004, was recognized in the financial statements. It is expected that market services revenue recognized in 2006 will be significantly lower than in 2005. As discussed above, our new business model includes an initiative whereby Marsh seeks to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that are disclosed to its clients. Management expects that this incremental revenue will affect MMCs results in 2006. Given the relatively recent launch of Marshs compensation initiative and the competitive challenges we currently face in the insurance brokerage market, it is difficult to predict the specific timing and amount of this revenue impact. In addition to the impact on revenue of the elimination of market services agreements (MSA), revenues in the risk and insurance services segment were affected by declining commercial insurance premium rates during most of 2005. Premium rate decreases began to abate in the fourth quarter of 2005 due to the initial effects of the major storms that hit the United States. A more significant impact on reinsurance premium rates as a result of the storms is expected in the first quarter of 2006. At December 31, 2005, the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004 was approximately $130 million. MMC intends to collect outstanding MSA revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004, and is enforcing its contractual rights to collect amounts due. In December 2005, MMC initiated arbitration proceedings against certain insurance carriers for this purpose. However, there is no assurance that MMC will collect all amounts due. To the extent MMC does not collect accrued amounts, a charge to earnings would result. As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the January 2005 settlement agreement with the NYAG and NYSID, MMC established an $850 million policyholder fund. Policyholders representing 88% of the value of the fund, or approximately $750 million, opted to participate and have signed a release related to all matters alleged in the NYAG lawsuit and NYSID amended citation, except for claims which are based on, arise out of, or relate to the purchase or sale of MMC securities. Also as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 21, 2005, working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the NAIC), MMC reached a multi state regulatory settlement. The NAIC settlement agreement adopts the business reforms and the $850 million fund for policyholder clients provided by MMCs previous settlement with the NYAG and NYSID. The NAIC agreement has been executed by MMC and Marsh, and as of February 17, 2006, has been adopted by insurance commissioners in 33 states and the District of Columbia and Guam. 30 Restructuring In response to MMCs changed business environment, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005. The restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2005, net restructuring expenses were $317 million, primarily related to the 2005 restructuring plan. These charges comprise severance and other termination benefits of $196 million related to the elimination of approximately 2,600 employee positions, future rent under non cancelable leases of $116 million and other costs of $41 million, partially offset by a $36 million gain from the sale of certain small commercial accounts and other dispositions. In addition, in 2005 MMC incurred incremental expense related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of $12 million. Additional charges of approximately $50 million are expected to be incurred in 2006, largely in the first half of the year, as the remaining actions contemplated under the 2005 restructuring plan are completed. Annual savings of $375 million are expected when the 2005 plan is fully implemented. Results in 2005 reflect approximately $160 million of savings realized from the 2005 plan, with the remaining savings of approximately $215 million expected in 2006. All of the savings from the 2005 restructuring plan relate to the risk and insurance services segment. Results in 2005 also reflect savings of approximately $400 million resulting from the 2004 restructuring plan. Employee Retention Initiatives In late 2004, and in 2005, MMC initiated a number of actions designed to retain and motivate employees throughout our businesses. Retention awards were granted, primarily in risk and insurance services and consulting, resulting in additional costs of $115 million in 2005. In addition, stock option exchange programs were offered to employees who held deeply underwater MMC or Putnam options. The option exchange programs are discussed in more detail later in this MD&A. MMC also implemented new or expanded long term incentive programs in several of its businesses. Businesses Exited in 2005 In October 2005, Marsh completed the sale of Crump Group, Inc., its U.S. based wholesale insurance broker. The gain on the sale of $14 million, net of tax, was recognized in the fourth quarter. In December 2005 MMC agreed to sell its majority interest in Sedgwick CMS Holdings. The sale was completed on January 31, 2006, and we will recognize the associated gain on the sale in the first quarter of 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, MMC determined that the Crump and SCMS businesses met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. All previously reported financial information has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these dispositions. In May 2005, MMC sold the assets of MMC Capital, which had been MMCs private equity management subsidiary, to Stone Point Capital LLC (Stone Point), an entity controlled by the former managers of MMC Capital for approximately $3 million. At the time of the asset sale, Stone Point assumed responsibility for management of the Trident Funds and other private equity funds previously managed by MMC Capital. MMC does not participate in the investment decisions or management of Stone Point or the private equity funds managed by Stone Point. MMC, through its subsidiary Risk Capital Holdings, continues to own investments in firms such as Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd. and Axis Capital Holdings, Ltd., as well as its investments in the Trident Funds and other funds managed by Stone Point, which have a total recorded value at December 31, 2005 of approximately $397 million. MMC no longer receives management fees or origination fees related to Stone Points asset management business, but may receive performance fees from Trident Funds II and III based on each funds aggregate rate of return. MMC continues to receive dividends and to recognize capital 31 appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings and has approximately $190 million of remaining capital commitments to funds managed by Stone Point. Long Term Financings In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new five year $1.2 billion multi currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The new facility, which will expire in 2010, replaced MMCs $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In December 2005, certain of MMCs foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately $510 million under the new facility, primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In connection with the termination of its previous revolving credit facilities, MMC recorded as interest expense a $7 million write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In September 2005, MMC completed two financings to enhance liquidity. MMC returned to the public capital markets, issuing $550 million of 5.15% Senior Notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay down outstanding bank borrowings that were scheduled to mature in December 2006. Also in September 2005, MMC refinanced its headquarters building in New York by entering into a 30 year, $475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 5.7%. This replaced the existing $200 million, 9.8% mortgage due in 2009. The incremental proceeds, net of a $34 million prepayment charge, were used to pay down outstanding short term debt. 32 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions, except per share figures) 2005  2004  2003 Revenue: Service Revenue $ 11,469 $ 11,561 $ 11,100 Investment Income (Loss) 183 200 100 Operating Revenue 11,652 11,761 11,200 Expense: Compensation and Benefits 6,945 6,706 5,710 Other Operating Expenses 3,811 3,486 3,032 Regulatory and Other Settlements 40 969 10 Operating Expenses 10,796 11,161 8,752 Operating Income $ 856 $ 600 $ 2,448 Income From Continuing Operations $ 369 $ 154 $ 1,516 Discontinued Operations, net of tax 35 22 24 Net Income $ 404 $ 176 $ 1,540 Income from Continuing Operations Per Share: Basic $ 0.69 $ 0.29 $ 2.85 Diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.29 $ 2.77 Net Income Per Share: Basic $ 0.75 $ 0.33 $ 2.89 Diluted $ 0.74 $ 0.33 $ 2.81 Average Number of Shares Outstanding: Basic 538 526 533 Diluted 543 535 548 Consolidated operating income in 2005 increased 43% to $856 million, reflecting significantly lower costs related to regulatory settlements at Marsh and Putnam and savings from restructuring initiatives partly offset by lower revenues in risk and insurance services and investment management, employee retention costs and incremental costs from the implementation of SFAS 123(R). Risk and insurance services results in 2005 include the impact of a $402 million decrease in MSA revenue. The segments 2004 results were impacted by an $850 million charge relating to the settlement agreement reached with the NYAG and NYSID. Investment management results in 2005 reflect reduced costs for regulatory settlements and related charges, partly offset by a decline in revenue resulting from lower assets under management. Results for Consulting reflect a 4% increase in revenue and lower costs for restructuring and restructuring related charges. Results for Risk Consulting and Technology in 2005 reflect a full year of operations for Kroll, which was acquired in July 2004. Corporate results in 2005 include restructuring charges of $59 million, incremental compensation expense of $64 million, primarily related to stock options resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as of July 1, 2005, and $30 million of settlement and other costs. In 2004, corporate expenses included a credit of $105 million for insurance recoveries related to World Trade Center losses. Consolidated Revenues and Expenses Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $11.7 billion was 1% lower than in 2004. Reduced revenue in the risk and insurance services and investment management segments was offset by increases in the risk consulting & technology, and consulting segments. Revenue 33 decreased 6% on an underlying basis, which measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions and using constant currency rates. Excluding the impact of the elimination of MSAs, underlying revenue decreased 3%. The impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and dispositions on MMCs operating revenue by segments is as follows: Twelve Months Ended  Components of Revenue Change  December 31, (In millions, except percentage figures)  2005   2004   % Change GAAP Revenue   Currency Impact   Acquisitions/ Dispositions Impact   Underlying Revenue(a)  Risk and Insurance Services Insurance Services (a) $ 4,567 $ 5,166 (12 )% 1 % (13 )% Reinsurance Services 836 859 (3 )% 1 % (4 )% Risk Capital Holdings (b) 189 180 5 % (8 )% 13 % Total Risk and Insurance Services (c) 5,592 6,205 (10 )% 1 % (11 )% Risk Consulting & Technology (c) 946 405 133 % (1 )% 113 % 21 % Consulting Human Resource Consulting (c) 2,708 2,704 1 % (1 )% Specialty Consulting 909 774 17 % 1 % 16 % 3,617 3,478 4 % 1 % 3 % Reimbursed Expenses 185 159 Total Consulting 3,802 3,637 4 % 1 % 3 % Investment Management 1,506 1,710 (12 )% (12 )% Total Operating Segments (c) $ 11,846 $ 11,957 (1 )% 1 % 4 % (6 )% Corporate/Eliminations (194 ) (196 ) Total (c) $ 11,652 $ 11,761 (1 )% 1 % 4 % (6 )% Twelve Months Ended  Components of Revenue Change  December 31, (In millions, except percentage figures)  2004   2003   % Change GAAP Revenue   Underlying Revenue(a)   Currency/ Acquisitions Impact  Risk and Insurance Services (c) $ 6,205 $ 6,133 1 % (3 )% 4 % Risk Consulting & Technology (c) 405 19 100 +% (18 )% 100+% Consulting (c) 3,637 3,290 11 % 3 % 8 % Investment Management 1,710 1,955 (13 )% (13 )% Total Operating Segments $ 11,957 $ 11,397 5 % (3 )% 8 % Corporate/Eliminations (196 ) (197 ) Total Revenue (c) $ 11,761 $ 11,200 5 % (3 )% 8 % (a) Underlying revenue measures the change in revenue before the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, using constant currency exchange rates. Underlying revenue for Insurance Services in 2005 decreased 13% in the twelve months, including a 7% decline related to market services agreements, and for the Risk and Insurance Services segment underlying revenue decreased 11% in the twelve months, including a 6% decline related to market services agreements. (b) Risk Capital Holdings owns MMCs investments in insurance and financial services firms such as Ace Ltd., XL Capital Ltd., and Axis Capital Holdings Ltd., as well as the Trident funds. (c) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current presentation. The data presented above excludes the results of the U.S. wholesale broking and claims management businesses, which are classified as discontinued operations. 34 During 2005, revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% from 2004. Underlying revenue declined 11%, resulting from a $402 million decline in market services revenue, lower levels of new business and renewals and the impact of lower insurance premium rates. These declines were partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Risk consulting & technology revenue increased $541 million. Due to the acquisition of Kroll in July 2004, results in 2005 include, for the first time, a full year of revenue for Kroll, compared with six months of revenue in 2004. Underlying growth in risk consulting & technology was 21%, due to growth in Krolls technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring, and background screening businesses. Consulting revenue increased 4%, resulting from a 17% increase in Mercers specialty consulting businesses. Investment management revenue declined 12% as a result of the decrease in assets under management and lower investment income. Consolidated operating expenses decreased 3% from 2004 to 2005. This was primarily due to savings from restructuring initiatives and lower regulatory and other settlement expenses, partly offset by employee retention costs, the impact of acquisitions, higher benefits costs, and incremental costs, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123 (R). In addition, Putnams expenses in 2005 include a charge of $37 million for the estimated cost necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Expenses in 2004 include an $850 million charge related to the NYAG/NYSID settlement, costs of $224 million related to Putnams settlement and agreements with the SEC and Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and restructuring costs of $337 million, partly offset by a $105 million credit from the final insurance settlement related to World Trade Center losses. Consolidated revenue in 2004 increased 5% from 2003. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Revenue decreased 3% on an underlying basis, primarily driven by a decrease in investment management revenue due to a decline in average assets under management and a decrease in risk and insurance services revenue resulting from a decision to no longer accept MSA revenue for placements made after September 30, 2004. These revenue declines were partially offset by an increase in underlying revenues in consulting due to higher demand for strategic advice. Consolidated operating expenses increased 27% in 2004 over 2003, of which 10% was due to the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Expenses in 2004 also include an $850 million charge related to the settlement agreement with the NYAG and the NYSID, charges of $224 million related to Putnams settlement agreements, costs of $337 million related to restructuring MMCs businesses, severance of $108 million incurred prior to implementation of the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter and increased pension costs of $93 million. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions, a credit to compensation expense related to the settlement with Putnams former chief executive officer and a credit of $105 million from the final settlement with insurers for claims related to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Risk and Insurance Services In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, MMCs subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking and insurance program management services, primarily under the name of Marsh; and engage in reinsurance broking, catastrophe and financial modeling services and related advisory functions, primarily under the name of Guy Carpenter. 35 Marsh and Guy Carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services primarily through fees paid by clients and commissions paid out of premiums charged by insurance and reinsurance companies. Commission rates vary in amount depending upon the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer, the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiations with clients. Revenues are affected by premium rate levels in the insurance markets, since compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds. In many cases, compensation may be negotiated in advance on the basis of the estimated value of the services to be performed. Revenue is also affected by fluctuations in the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients themselves and by increases or decreases in the value of the risks that have been insured, new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients. Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh eliminated contingent compensation, or market services agreements with insurers, under which it had earned revenues based upon such factors as the overall volume, growth and, in some cases, profitability, of the total business placed by Marsh with a given insurer. The circumstances under which we terminated our market services agreements, and the related revenue impact in our Risk and Insurance Services segment, are discussed above under Significant Developments in 2005 New Business Model in Risk and Insurance Services. For billing and other administrative services, Marsh and Guy Carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. The investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. These regulations typically provide for segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them. Interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. Following the sale of MMC Capitals business in May 2005, discussed above under Significant Developments in 2005 Businesses Exited in 2005, we no longer receive fees in connection with the private equity investments previously managed by MMC Capital, nor do we receive management fees or origination fees related to this business. We continue to receive dividends and to recognize capital appreciation or depreciation on the investments held by Risk Capital Holdings, as well as revenue on Risk Capital Holdings sales of investments from time to time. The results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005  2004  2003 Revenue $ 5,592 $ 6,205 $ 6,133 Expense 5,287 6,121 4,526 Operating Income $ 305 $ 84 $ 1,607 Operating Income Margin 5.5 % 1.4 % 26.2 % Revenue Revenue in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 10% in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting decreases in both insurance services and reinsurance services revenue. In insurance services, underlying revenue decreased 13%. Excluding the impact of decreased market services revenue, underlying revenue decreased 6%, reflecting lower new business volume and lower commercial premium rates. The decrease in underlying revenue was most significant in the United States; however, the percentage decline improved in the fourth quarter compared with earlier quarters in 2005 despite continued premium rate declines in the commercial insurance marketplace. Market services revenue declined from $521 million in 2004 to $119 million in 2005. Effective October 1, 2004, Marsh agreed to eliminate contingent compensation agreements with insurers. The 36 market services revenue recognized in 2005 relates to placements made prior to October 1, 2004. Marsh did not accrue a portion of market services revenue earned on those placements because it could not complete its normal process to determine that collection of these amounts was reasonably assured for certain contracts. Any such revenue earned prior to but not accrued at September 30, 2004 is recognized when collected or when confirmation of the amount of payment is received from the carriers. This resulted in the recognition of market services revenue of $119 million in 2005. It is expected that market services revenue in 2006 will be significantly lower than in 2005. Reinsurance premium rates in the U.S. property catastrophe and certain specialty lines appear to be increasing due to the effects of the recent hurricanes on insurance marketplace conditions, and have affected revenue in the first quarter of 2006. However, revenue from sales of investments by Risk Capital Holdings is expected to decline in 2006, and it remains difficult to estimate the amount and timing of the incremental revenue to be generated by Marshs commission and fee initiative described above. Revenue for the risk and insurance services segment grew 1% in 2004 over 2003. Underlying revenue declined 3%. In insurance services underlying revenue decreased 6% primarily due to a reduction in MSA revenue from $820 million in 2003 to $521 million in 2004. This excludes the market services revenue of $20 million in 2004 and $25 million in 2003 related to the employee benefits business transferred to Consulting effective April 1, 2005. Client revenue increased approximately 1%, reflecting 3% growth in Europe and 4% growth in other international markets, partially offset by a 2% decline in North America. Underlying revenue in reinsurance broking remained unchanged. Expense Expenses in the risk and insurance services segment decreased 14% in 2005, compared with the prior year. Expenses in 2004 included a $850 million charge related to the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID. Expenses in 2005 include restructuring costs of $255 million related to the restructuring activities we initiated in 2005 (the 2005 Plan), discussed below, as well as $78 million of costs related to employee retention programs, $88 million related to incremental regulatory and compliance costs, and higher benefit costs due to higher pension expense. Expenses in 2005 also include costs of approximately $2 million related to restructuring activities that began in the fourth quarter of 2004. The expense increases described above more than offset expense savings resulting from the restructuring activities undertaken in 2004 and 2005. In 2005 charges of $255 million related to the 2005 Plan were incurred, primarily for severance and benefits related to staff reductions affecting approximately 2,600 employees and for future rent under non cancelable leases. Annualized savings of approximately $375 million are expected in the risk and insurance services segment when the 2005 Plan is fully implemented in the first half of 2006. Of this amount, $160 million was realized in 2005 and the remaining $215 million of expected savings should be realized in 2006. Additional restructuring charges related to the 2005 plan of $50 million are expected to be incurred in 2006, largely in the first half of the year. In 2004, risk and insurance services expenses increased 35% over 2003. Approximately 20% of the increase was due to an $850 million charge for the settlement agreement with the NYAG and the NYSID and legal and other costs of $31 million related to this matter. Expenses in 2004 included restructuring charges of $231 million, including severance and other termination benefits, future rent under non cancelable leases and lease termination costs and incremental amortization of $7 million related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements. Expenses in 2004 37 also included $8 million for employee retention programs. In connection with accounting guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K., MMC reassessed its obligation to provide future claims handling and certain administrative services for brokerage clients in the European marketplace. MMC determined that under certain circumstances it is obligated to provide such services based on its current business practices and recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $65 million to reflect the change in estimated cost to provide these services. The effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expenses by 6%. On an underlying basis, and excluding the items previously discussed, expenses increased 4%. Risk Consulting and Technology MMCs Risk Consulting and Technology segment consists of Kroll and its subsidiaries, acquired by MMC in July 2004. The segment also includes portions of the risk consulting business previously managed by Marsh under the Risk and Insurance Services segment. The services previously managed by Marsh include forensic accounting, insurance claims accounting, and preparation and crisis consulting. Kroll delivers its services through four business groups: consulting services; corporate advisory & restructuring; security; and technology services. Kroll receives compensation for its risk consulting and technology services in the form of fees paid by clients. These fees are typically earned on an hourly, project, fixed fee or per unit basis. Krolls revenue is subject to changes in international economic and regulatory conditions. Some of Krolls revenue sources are counter cyclical to the performance of the economy in general. These sources may include, for example, fees from restructuring, turnaround and forensic engagements relating to commercial bankruptcies and bond defaults. Kroll is also subject to normal competitive forces such as pricing pressures, demand for professional staff and new product development on the part of competitors, particularly in technology services. The results of operations for the risk consulting and technology segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005  2004  2003 Revenue $ 946 $ 405 $ 19 Expense 822 357 27 Operating Income $ 124 $ 48 $ (8 ) Operating Income Margin 13.1 % 11.9 % (42.1 )% Results of Operations The year to year comparisons of the segments revenue, expense and operating income are significantly impacted by the fact that we acquired Kroll in July 2004. As a result, 2004 results include only six months of Krolls operations. Underlying revenue growth in 2005 was 21% due to growth in the technology services, corporate advisory and restructuring and background screening practices. Expenses include amortization of identified intangible assets of $58 million and $24 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consulting MMC conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Mercer operates through two main business groups. Mercer Human Resource Consulting includes practice groups specializing in retirement and investment consulting, human resource services and investments, health and benefits and human capital. The Mercer Specialty Consulting Businesses focus on management consulting, organizational design and change management, and economic consulting. 38 The major component of Mercers revenue, in both Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the Mercer Specialty Consulting Businesses, is fees paid by clients for advice and services. Mercer Human Resource Consulting, principally through its Health & Benefits line of business, also earns significant revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. Revenue for Mercer Global Investments discretionary investment management business and certain of Mercer HR Services and Investments defined contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under administration. Revenue in the consulting business is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients particular industries and markets. Revenue is also subject to competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, the effect of government policies and regulations, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Revenues from the provision of discretionary investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by securities market performance. The results of operations for the consulting segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005  2004  2003 Revenue $ 3,802 $ 3,637 $ 3,290 Expense 3,351 3,228 2,829 Operating Income $ 451 $ 409 $ 461 Operating Income Margin 11.9 % 11.2 % 14.0 % Revenue Consulting revenue in 2005 increased 4% compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3%, due to a 16% increase in Mercers specialty consulting businesses, partly offset by a 1% decline in human resources consulting. The increase in underlying revenue in specialty consulting reflects increases of 24% in management consulting, reflecting a 25% increase in Mercer Oliver Wyman, and 6% in economic consulting. Within the human resources consulting businesses, underlying revenue decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in the revenue associated with defined contribution plan assets previously administered by Putnam and transferred to Mercer effective January 1, 2005, increased pricing competition on traditional actuarial valuation services, and a decline in the employee benefits business transferred from Marsh to Mercer. These declines were partly offset by strong growth in human capital consulting. Consulting revenue in 2004 increased 11% over 2003. Acquisitions, which accounted for 4% of the revenue growth in 2004, include Synhrgy HR Technologies which closed in January, 2004, and Oliver, Wyman & Company (OWC) which closed on April 1, 2003. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 3%. In Mercer HR Consulting, underlying revenue was flat. In Mercers specialty consulting businesses, underlying revenue increased 13%. Expense Consulting expenses increased 4% in 2005 compared with 2004. On an underlying basis, expenses increased 3%, as savings from restructuring activity and lower costs for restructuring were offset by employee retention costs, increased benefits costs and higher expenses in specialty consulting due to a higher volume of business. Consulting expenses increased 14% in 2004 compared with 2003. Expenses in 2004 included restructuring charges of $62 million, including severance and other termination benefits and future 39 rent under non cancelable leases and lease termination costs as well as incremental expense of $7 million related to accelerated amortization or abandonment of leasehold improvements and other assets. Expenses in 2004 also included $4 million for employee retention programs. In addition, the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange increased expense by 9%. On an underlying basis, and excluding the items discussed above, expenses increased 2%, primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs. Investment Management MMC conducts business in its Investment Management segment through Putnam. Putnam provides investment management and related services through a broad range of investment products, including the Putnam Funds, its own family of mutual funds which are offered to individual and institutional investors. In support of the primary investment management business, Putnam subsidiaries provide other related services including transfer agency, underwriting, distribution, shareholder services, custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. PFTC serves as transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, registrar and custodian for the Putnam Funds and provides custody services to several external clients. Putnams revenue is derived primarily from investment management and 12b 1 fees (described more fully below) received from the Putnam Funds and investment management fees for institutional accounts. Putnam also receives fees from the Putnam Funds for administrative services performed by PFTC. Putnam companies receive fees for the investment management services provided to the Putnam Funds and institutional accounts pursuant to investment advisory contracts under which the mutual fund or institutional investor pays fees to the Putnam company that manages the fund or account. The amount of the fees varies depending on the individual mutual fund or institutional account. Fees are usually based on a sliding scale in relation to assets under management, and, in some cases are also based on investment performance. These advisory contracts generally may be terminated by either party without penalty, and contracts with the Putnam Funds must be approved annually by the funds shareholders or trustees, including a majority who are not affiliated with Putnam. Putnam management and the fund trustees regularly review the Putnam Fund contract fee structures in light of fund performance, the level and range of services provided, and current industry conditions. Investment management revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of Putnams assets under management. Assets under management are particularly affected by fluctuations in domestic and international stock and bond market prices, and the net level of investments and withdrawals by current and new mutual fund shareholders and institutional clients. Items affecting revenue also include, but are not limited to, actual and relative investment performance, service to clients, the development and marketing of new investment products, the relative attractiveness of Putnams investment styles under prevailing market conditions, changes in the investment patterns of fund shareholders and institutional clients and Putnams ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels. All open end Putnam funds other than money market funds have adopted distribution plans pursuant to Rule 12b 1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, commonly referred to as 12b 1 plans. Pursuant to these 12b 1 plans, the Putnam Funds make payments to PRM to cover costs relating to distribution of the Putnam Funds and services provided to shareholders, at rates that differ by class of fund shares. These payments, known as Rule 12b 1 fees, enable PRM to pay service fees and other continuing compensation to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds and provide services to fund shareholders. PRM retains some Rule 12b 1 fees as compensation for the costs of distribution and other services provided by Putnam and its affiliates to shareholders and for commissions advanced by Putnam at the point of sale (and recovered through fees received over 40 time) to firms that distribute shares of the Putnam Funds. These 12b 1 plans, and Rule 12b 1 fees paid by the Putnam Funds thereunder, are subject to annual renewal by the fund trustees and to termination by vote of the fund shareholders or by vote of a majority of the trustees who are not affiliated with Putnam. PFTC receives compensation from the Putnam Funds for its administrative (transfer agency and shareholder services) and custodial services pursuant to, respectively, investor servicing agreements which may be terminated by either party on 90 days notice, and pursuant to written custody agreements which may be terminated by either party on 30 days notice. These contracts generally provide for compensation on the basis of several factors which vary with the type of service being provided. The transfer agent servicing fee received by PFTC is a fixed rate per account for retail shareholders and a fixed rate service fee based on assets under management for mutual fund defined contribution shareholders. The results of operations for the investment management segment are presented below: (In millions of dollars) 2005  2004  2003 Revenue $ 1,506 $ 1,710 $ 1,955 Expense 1,243 1,612 1,452 Operating Income $ 263 $ 98 $ 503 Operating Income Margin 17.5 % 5.7 % 25.7 % Revenue Putnams revenue decreased 12% in 2005, reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in assets under management, lower 12b 1 fee revenue, and decreased investment gains. Assets under management averaged $196 billion in 2005, a 10% decline from the $217 billion managed in 2004. Assets under management aggregated $189 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $213 billion at December 31, 2004. The change in assets under management from December 31, 2004 results primarily from net redemptions of $31 billion, partly offset by the positive impact of market performance. We expect average assets under management to decline in 2006. Putnam receives service fees from the Putnam mutual funds for transfer agent, custody, and other administrative services, as contracted by the Trustees of the Putnam mutual funds. Effective January 2005, the transfer agent service fee agreement was converted to a fixed rate per retail shareholder account and a fixed rate service fee based on average assets under management for mutual fund assets in defined contribution plans. For the first six months of 2004, the transfer agent service fee agreement was based on the reimbursement of the cost of service. For the third and fourth quarters of 2004, transfer agent service fees were based on a fixed fee and recorded as revenue. The change in the service fee agreement resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expense of approximately $32 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The change in the service fee contract is expected to have an immaterial impact on operating income in future quarters. At the end of 2005, assets held in equity securities represented 68% of assets under management , compared with 69% in 2004 and 72% in 2003, while investments in fixed income products represented 32%, compared with 31% in 2004 and 28% in 2003. Putnams revenue decreased 13% in 2004, reflecting a decrease in fees due to a decline in average assets under management, partially offset by higher investment gains, higher equity income resulting from THL transaction fees related to private equity investments and increased transfer agent fees. Assets under management averaged $217 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% decline from the $258 billion managed in 2003. Assets under management aggregated $213 billion at 41 December 31, 2004 compared with $240 billion at December 31, 2003. The change from December 31, 2003 primarily resulted from net redemptions of $51 billion, partly offset by increases due to market appreciation of $16 billion and the consolidation of PanAgoras $8 billion of assets under management as of July 2004. The change in the service fee calculation mentioned above resulted in an increase in both service fee revenue and expenses of approximately $41 million during the second half of 2004. Year end and average assets under management are presented below: (In billions of dollars) 2005  2004  2003 Mutual Funds: Growth Equity $ 31 $ 38 $ 46 Value Equity 37 41 43 Blend Equity 26 28 32 Fixed Income 32 36 42 126 143 163 Institutional: Equity 34 40 51 Fixed Income 29 30 26 63 70 77 Year end Assets $ 189 $ 213 $ 240 Assets from Non US Investors $ 32 $ 38 $ 39 Average Assets $ 196 $ 217 $ 258 Components of year to date change in ending assets under management: Net Redemptions including Dividends Reinvested $ (31 ) $ (51 ) $ (61 ) Impact of PanAgora Acquisition $ $ 8 $ Impact of Market/Performance $ 7 $ 16 $ 50 The categories of mutual fund assets reflect style designations aligned with each funds prospectus. Expense Expenses for 2005 decreased 23% from 2004. Expenses in 2005 include a $37 million charge for the estimated costs necessary to address issues relating to the calculation of certain amounts previously paid to Putnam by the Putnam mutual funds in the form of cost reimbursements to Putnam for transfer agency services relating to defined contribution operations. Expenses in 2004 include a charge of $224 million related to Putnams regulatory settlements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on market timing issues. Other expense reductions in 2005 include lower compensation and severance costs, reduced costs related to regulatory issues, a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a decrease in restructuring charges. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in expenses previously borne by the funds under the prior transfer agent service agreement. Putnams expenses in 2004 include a $25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with Putnams former chief executive officer. Equity awards granted in September 2005 are expected to increase Putnams expenses by approximately $26 million in 2006. Expenses in 2004, which increased 11% from 2003, included $224 million for Putnams regulatory settlements with the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Restructuring costs totaled 42 $26 million, including $10 million related to a start up hedge fund management business at MMC that was subsequently discontinued. Other significant items recorded in 2004 were severance of $57 million incurred prior to the fourth quarter restructuring, as well as incremental costs related to regulatory issues and repositioning Putnam, including legal and audit costs of $45 million and communications costs of $16 million. In 2004, Putnam discontinued the practice of directing brokerage commissions and virtually eliminated the use of soft dollars, causing expenses to increase by approximately $40 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense for prepaid dealer commissions and a $25 million credit to compensation expense associated with the settlement with Putnams former chief executive officer. Corporate Items Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses were $287 million in 2005 compared to $39 million in 2004. Expenses in 2005 include $64 million of incremental expenses, primarily related to stock options, resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123 (R) effective July 1, 2005. The incremental cost related to the implementation of SFAS 123 (R) is being charged to corporate and not to the operating segments in 2005 because this expense is excluded from the operating company results reviewed by MMCs chief operating decision maker for performance measurement. In addition, $6 million was recorded for severance and other termination benefits related to the 2005 Plan, and a charge of $49 million was recorded in the first quarter related to the consolidation of office space in London. Because the office consolidation was initiated by MMC to benefit its London operations as a whole, the related charge was recorded in corporate. Corporate expenses also reflect $30 million of charges in connection with the resolution of certain litigation and related matters which are discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Corporate expenses in 2004 included $18 million of restructuring costs, including severance and other termination benefits, future rent under non cancelable leases and lease termination costs. The impact of the final settlement for insured losses related to the WTC reduced Corporate expenses in 2004. The replacement value of the assets exceeded their book value by $105 million which was recorded as a reduction of other operating expenses. Integration and Restructuring Charges Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements discusses integration and restructuring costs. The following chart summarizes the costs incurred and the savings realized and projected for MMCs restructuring activities. (In millions of dollars) Costs Incurred Savings Realized Incremental Savings Expected 2004 2005 2005 2006 2004 Plan $ 337 $ 3 $ 400 2005 Plan 310 160 215 Restructuring activities under the 2005 plan, which we initiated in the first quarter of 2005 are nearing completion. In 2005, MMC incurred expenses in connection with the 2005 plan of $310 million (approximately two thirds of which was severance cost). Additional expenses of $50 million are expected to be incurred primarily in the first half of 2006. Once the 2005 plan is fully implemented, MMC expects to achieve annualized cost savings of $375 million, all of which is in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. Results in 2005 reflect approximately $160 million of the savings 43 expected under the 2005 plan with the remaining $215 million of savings expected to be realized in 2006. Savings under the 2004 plan were $400 million, substantially all of which was realized in 2005. Restructuring costs in 2005 also include a $4 million increase to the estimated liability for future rent under non cancellable leases related to the Johnson and Higgins and Sedgwick acquisitions. Stock Option Exchanges At the May 2005 Annual Meeting, MMCs shareholders approved a stock option exchange offer for MMC options. Under the exchange offer, eligible employees could exchange certain deeply underwater options for new options with an estimated fair value equal to 90% of the value of options surrendered in exchange, calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model. Effective July 1, 2005, employees elected to exchange 42 million options for 16 million new options. The exchange resulted in the retirement of 26 million options and no incremental compensation expense was incurred in connection with the new option grants. The exercise price of the new options of $27.86 is equal to the market price of MMCs common stock as of the new grant date. The new options were unvested when granted and will vest on the later of the second anniversary of the new option grant or the vesting date of the tendered option. The other terms and conditions of the new options are substantially similar to those of the tendered options they replaced. On September 29, 2005, certain eligible participants in the Putnam Investments Trust Equity Partnership Plan participated in a voluntary option exchange pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Exchange Certain Outstanding Options (the Offer to Exchange), dated August 30, 2005. Under the Offer to Exchange, holders of options on Class B shares meeting certain eligibility requirements could elect to exchange those options for restricted shares with the equivalent value of the exchanged options, as determined using the Black Scholes valuation model. As a result of the Offer to Exchange, a total of 2,201,850 options were retired and 139,388 restricted shares were issued at a grant price of $28.26 per share. Interest Interest income was $47 million for 2005, an increase of $26 million from 2004. The increase in interest income reflected the combination of higher average corporate cash balances and generally higher average interest rates in 2005 compared with 2004. Interest expense was $332 million in 2005 compared to $219 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of Kroll and a $34 million charge in 2005 for the prepayment of the $200 million mortgage on MMCs corporate headquarters in New York. In addition, interest expense in 2005 includes a write off of $7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to MMCs prior revolving credit agreements which were refinanced in December 2005. Interest income earned on corporate funds was $21 million in 2004 compared with $24 million in 2003. Interest expense increased from $185 million in 2003 to $219 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to an increase in the amount of average outstanding debt, primarily due to the acquisition of Kroll. Income Taxes MMCs consolidated effective tax rate was 33.6% in 2005, a decrease from 59.4% in 2004. The decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact in 2004 of the non deductibility of Putnams $224 million in regulatory settlements and of a lower benefit related to Marshs $850 million settlement of the NYAG lawsuit; partially offset in 2005 by an increase in valuation allowances 44 provided on net operating losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. In 2003 the effective tax rate was 32.8%. The increase in the effective rate in 2004 compared with 2003 results primarily from the tax impact of the aforementioned settlements, and a partially offsetting benefit for foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of MMCs earnings, which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the rate. Furthermore, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations, and may require valuation allowances affecting the rate, depending on estimates of their realizability. MMC establishes allowances for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits and litigation to the extent that such liabilities are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, allowances are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue for which an allowance had previously been recorded. Such adjustments could have a material impact on MMCs effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows for a particular future period. Liquidity and Capital Resources MMCs routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is cash flows from our operations. Cash on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Operating Cash Flows MMC generated $399 million of cash from operations in 2005 compared with $2.1 billion in 2004. These amounts reflect the net income earned by MMC during those periods adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments for accrued liabilities or receipts of assets. In addition to the routine timing of payments and receipts, MMC had several significant events which impacted its cash flow over the past two years, due to differences between when the items are recognized in net income and when they are paid. These include payments in 2005 of approximately $308 million for regulatory settlements accrued in 2004, payment of restructuring costs and discretionary contributions of $235 million to the pension plans in the U.K. As previously discussed, in January 2005 MMC reached a settlement with the NYAG and NYSID that resolved the actions commenced by them against MMC and Marsh. As a result of this agreement, MMC recorded a charge in 2004 for an $850 million policyholder fund. MMC paid the first $255 million to the fund on June 1, 2005. An additional $255 million must be paid on or before June 1, 2006, and $170 million will be paid to the fund on or before each of June 1, 2007 and 2008, respectively. These amounts are included in Regulatory Settlements in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2005, the balance of accounts receivable related to accrued market services revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004 was $130 million. Following the announcement of the settlement with the NYAG and NYSID, MMC reaffirmed its intention to collect outstanding MSA revenue earned prior to October 1, 2004, and will seek to enforce its rights under the relevant contracts. In December 2005, MMC initiated arbitration proceedings against certain insurance carriers for this purpose. However, there is no assurance that MMC will be successful in collecting all amounts due. To the extent such accrued amounts are not collected, a charge to earnings would result. 45 MMC has funding requirements for the U.S. non qualified and U.K. plans in 2005 of approximately $19 million and $94 million, respectively. MMCs policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign law. There currently is no ERISA funding requirement for the U.S. qualified plan in 2005 or in 2006. Funding requirements for non U.S. plans vary country by country. During 2005, MMC contributed approximately $229 million to the U.S. pension plans and $498 million to the significant non U.S. pension plans, compared with $44 million for U.S. plans and $239 million for significant non U.S. plans in 2004. The contributions in 2005 include discretionary contributions of 8 million unregistered shares of MMC stock valued at $205 million to the U.S. qualified plan and $235 million of cash to the U.K. plans. These contributions resulted in an increase in prepaid pension expense for certain plans. The minimum pension liability related to any plan is recorded as part of the Pension, postretirement and post employment liability in the consolidated balance sheets. During 2005, the net funded status of the U.S. and significant non U.S. pension plans increased by $299 million and $303 million, respectively, due primarily to the discretionary contributions mentioned previously. In addition, changes made to the U.S. pension plan, discussed below under Managements Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies Retirement Benefits, reduced the benefit obligation of that plan by $138 million and a plan curtailment in the U.K. reduced the benefit obligations of non U.S. plans by $40 million. Benefit obligations of the U.S. and significant non U.S. pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $79 million and $818 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Contribution rates are determined by the local foreign actuaries based on local funding practices and requirements. Funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and or liabilities of the plan. In addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not required under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of MMCs cash flows, including dividends, investments, and share repurchases. Under generally accepted accounting principles, if the accumulated benefit obligation of a plan exceeds the fair value of that plans assets (an ABO deficit), an additional minimum liability is recorded for the amount of the ABO deficit. The additional minimum liability, plus the amount of prepaid pension cost recognized for that plan is charged to other comprehensive income (equity), net of applicable taxes. At December 31, 2005, MMC has prepaid pension costs of approximately $1.6 billion, which relate primarily to the U.S. qualified plan and two U.K. plans, as well as some smaller plans in various countries. Financing Cash Flows Net cash provided by financing activities was $128 million in 2005 compared with $1.2 billion in 2004. In December 2005, MMC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a new $1.2 billion multi currency revolving credit facility. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed by MMC. The facility, which will expire in December 2010, replaces MMCs $1.0 billion and $700 million revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Certain of MMCs foreign subsidiaries borrowed approximately $510 million under the new facility, primarily to fund the repatriation of accumulated earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In September 2005, MMC returned to the public capital markets, issuing $550 million of 5.15% Senior Notes due 2010 and $750 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2005 Notes). The net proceeds from the 2005 Notes were used to pay down the $1.3 billion term loan facility, discussed below. 46 Also in September 2005, MMC refinanced its headquarters building in New York city by entering into a 30 year, $475 million mortgage loan agreement at a fixed annual rate of 5.7%. This replaced the existing $200 million, 9.8% mortgage due in 2009. The incremental proceeds, net of a $34 million prepayment charge, were used to pay down outstanding short term debt. In December 2004, MMC completed financing with respect to a $1.3 billion term loan facility and the amendment of its existing $1 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in June 2007 and $700 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in June 2009. The term loan facility, which was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of the 2005 Notes, was scheduled to mature on December 31, 2006 and replaced revolving credit facilities of $700 million and $355 million, which were scheduled to expire in 2005. MMCs senior debt is currently rated Baa2 by Moodys and BBB by Standard & Poors. MMCs short term debt is currently rated P 2 by Moodys and A 2 by Standard & Poors. MMC carries a negative outlook from both Moodys and Standard & Poors. In July 2004, MMC issued $650 million of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2014 and $500 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2007. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay the commercial paper borrowings that were used to purchase Kroll. MMC paid total dividends of $363 million in 2005 ($0.68 per share) and $681 million ($1.30 per share) in 2004. MMC made no share repurchases in 2005. In 2004, MMC repurchased 11.4 million shares for $524 million, substantially all of which was purchased in the first and second quarters. MMC also maintains other credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $354 million at December 31, 2005 and $331 million at December 31, 2004. There was $83 million outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2005. Investing Cash Flows Cash provided by investing activities amounted to $153 million in 2005 compared with cash used for investing activities of $2.6 billion in 2004. Cash used for acquisitions decreased to $74 million from $2.4 billion in 2004. Acquisitions in 2004 included Kroll, Inc., Synhrgy HR Technologies, Corporate Systems, and the Australia and New Zealand operations of Heath Lambert. Remaining deferred cash payments of approximately $48 million related to acquisitions completed in 2005 and prior years are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities or in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005. In addition, cash generated by the sale of securities totaled $333 million in 2005 versus $199 million for 2004. MMCs additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $345 million in 2005 and $376 million in 2004, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. MMC has committed to potential future investments of approximately $295 million in connection with various private equity funds and other MMC investments. Commitments of $112 million relate to Trident III, a private equity fund managed by Stone Point. MMCs funding commitment to Trident III decreased by approximately $98 million upon the sale of the business of MMC Capital to the management team of Stone Point on May 31, 2005. MMCs remaining commitments relate to other funds managed by Stone Point (approximately $82 million) and by Putnam through THL and THLPC (approximately $101 million). Trident III closed in December 2003, and has an investment period of six years. MMC does not control or know the timing of capital calls that Stone Point will make on Trident IIIs investors. Typically, the investment period for funds of this type has been about four 47 years, which would indicate an expected capital call of approximately $35$50 million per year. Actual capital calls may occur more quickly. The majority of MMCs other investment commitments for funds managed by Stone Point are related to Trident II, the investment period for which is now closed for new investments. Any remaining capital calls for Trident II would relate to follow on investments in existing portfolio companies or for management fees or other partnership expenses. Significant future capital calls related to Trident II are not expected. Although it is anticipated that Trident II will be harvesting its remaining portfolio in 2006 and thereafter, the timing of any portfolio company sales and capital distributions is unknown and not controlled by MMC. Putnam has investment commitments of $101 million for three active THL funds, of which Putnam believes approximately $50 million will not be called. Putnam is authorized to commit to invest up to $187 million in future THL investment funds, but is not required to do so. At December 31, 2005 none of that additional $187 million is committed. Approximately $77 million was invested in 2005 related to all of the commitments discussed above. Commitments and Obligations MMCs contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Payment due by Period  Contractual Obligations Total  Within 1 Year  13 Years  45 Years  After 5 Years Bank Borrowings International $ 597 $ 429 $ 168 $ $ Current portion of long term debt 69 69 Long term debt 4,874 1,271 965 2,638 NYAG/NYSID settlement 595 255 340 Net operating leases 3,349 466 763 542 1,578 Service agreements 181 65 70 44 2 Other long term obligations 66 38 28 Total $ 9,731 $ 1,322 $ 2,640 $ 1,551 $ 4,218 Market Risk Certain of MMCs revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. Interest Rate Risk MMC manages its net exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing a mixture of variable and fixed rate borrowings to finance MMCs asset base. MMC uses interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage exposure to interest rate movements on its cash and investments as well as interest expense on borrowings. Rate swaps are only executed with highly creditworthy counterparties. MMC had the following investments and debt instruments subject to variable interest rates: (In millions of dollars) December 31, 2005 Cash and cash equivalents invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits (Note 1) $ 2,020 Fiduciary cash and investments (Note 1) $ 3,795 Variable rate debt outstanding (Note 11) $ 1,076 48 These investments and debt instruments are discussed more fully in the above indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the above balances, if short term interest rates increase by 10% or 40 basis points over the course of the year, annual interest income, including interest earned on fiduciary funds, would increase by approximately $14 million. However, this would be partially offset by a $3 million increase in interest expense resulting in a net increase to income before income taxes and minority interest of $11 million. Foreign Currency Risk The translated values of revenue and expense from MMCs international risk and insurance services and consulting operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. We periodically use forward contracts and options to limit foreign currency exchange rate exposure on net income and cash flows for specific, clearly defined transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. Equity Price Risk MMC holds investments in public and private companies, as well as in certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point, including Trident II and Trident III. Publicly traded investments of $143 million are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Non publicly traded investments of $54 million and $365 million are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, using the cost method and the equity method, respectively. Changes in value of trading securities are recognized in income when they occur. The investments that are classified as available for sale or that are not publicly traded are subject to risk of changes in market value, which if determined to be other than temporary, could result in realized impairment losses. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of such investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. Other A significant number of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are pending. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Managements Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding MMCs financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies MMC and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings. GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance. MMC analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. 49 In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are expected under MMCs various insurance programs. Retirement Benefits MMC maintains qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for eligible non U.S. employees. MMCs policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in U.S. and applicable foreign laws. The determination of net periodic pension cost is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and assumed rate of salary increase. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension costs and pension liabilities are disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. MMC believes the assumptions for each plan are reasonable and appropriate and will continue to evaluate actuarial assumptions at least annually and adjust them as appropriate. Pension expense in 2005 increased by $130 million compared with 2004. Based on its current assumptions, MMC expects pension expense to decrease by approximately $12 million in 2006 and currently expects to contribute approximately $145 million to the plans during the year. During 2005 MMC made changes to the U.S. pension plan that were designed to reduce MMCs benefits costs going forward. The changes, which are effective January 1, 2006, include changing the benefit formula from a final average salary to a career average salary as well as a change in the calculation for early retirement benefits. These changes do not affect pension benefits earned as of December 31, 2005. Future pension expense or credits will depend on plan provisions, future investment performance, future assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a half percentage point change in the rate of return and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic pension cost for the U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise approximately 90% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows: 0.5 Percentage Point Increase  0.5 Percentage Point Decrease  (In millions of dollars) U.S.  U.K.  U.S.  U.K. Assumed Rate of Return $ (13.2 ) $ (21.1 ) $ 13.2 $ 21.1 Discount Rate $ (29.1 ) $ (54.3 ) $ 31.2 $ 57.3 Changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant may not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long term rates of inflation and salary increases are correlated with the discount rate. MMC contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. The cost of these postretirement benefits for employees in the United States is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire, but is funded by MMC as incurred. This postretirement liability is included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Income Taxes MMCs tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax allowances are established when, despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable, there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged. These allowances, as well as the related interest, are adjusted to reflect changing facts and circumstances. Tax law requires items be included in MMCs tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Share based Payment Effective July 1, 2005, MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) Share based Payment, which requires, among other things, that the estimated fair value of stock options be charged to earnings. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate assumptions for inputs such as volatility and expected term necessary to estimate option values. In addition, management judgment is required to analyze the terms of the plans and awards granted thereunder to determine if awards will be treated as equity awards or liability awards, as defined by SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires that cost resulting from all share based transactions be recognized in the financial statements. Although the required effective date of adoption for SFAS 123(R) is the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, MMC elected to adopt early. MMC adopted SFAS 123(R) using a modified prospective method of adoption, as permitted. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Under this method, MMC is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. The compensation cost recognized for awards granted prior to July 1, 2005 is based on the estimated grant date fair value and expense attribution methodology originally determined under SFAS 123. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), MMC applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), to account for its stock based awards. Under APB 25, MMC generally only recorded stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock, restricted stock units, and deferred stock units. Under the provisions of APB 25, MMC was not required to recognize compensation expense for the cost of stock options or shares issued under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). With the adoption of SFAS 123(R), MMC will record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options and, as described below, shares issued under the ESPP pertaining to the third quarter 2005. In 2005 MMC incurred incremental compensation costs of $64 million, primarily related to stock options as a result of the early adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective July 1, 2005. This incremental cost was recorded as part of corporate expenses. 51 As of December 31, 2005, there was $152 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMCs option awards and $19 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnams option awards. The weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized are 1.5 years for MMC and 3.5 years for Putnam. Also as of December 31, 2005, there was $219 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to MMCs restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards and $110 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to Putnams restricted stock awards. Effective October 1, 2005, certain features in the MMC ESPP were changed so that shares of MMC common stock will be purchased at a price that is 95% of the average market price of the stock on each quarterly purchase date. In accordance with SFAS 123 (R), the ESPP is no longer compensatory beginning October 1, 2005. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Investment Valuation MMC holds investments in both public and private companies, as well as certain private equity funds managed by Stone Point and T.H. Lee. The majority of the public investments are accounted for as available for sale securities under SFAS No. 115. Where applicable, certain investments are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18. MMC periodically reviews the carrying value of its investments to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under the applicable accounting pronouncements. MMC bases its review on the facts and circumstances as they relate to each investment. Fair value of private equity investments is determined by the Funds investment managers. Factors considered in determining the fair value of private equity investments include: implied valuation of recently completed financing rounds that included sophisticated outside investors; performance multiples of comparable public companies; restrictions on the sale or disposal of the investments; trading characteristics of the securities; and the relative size of the holdings in comparison to other private investors and the public market float. In those instances where quoted market prices are not available, particularly for equity holdings in private companies, or formal restrictions limit the sale of securities, significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate value of MMCs investments. MMC reviews the appropriateness of valuation results for significant private equity investments with the fund manager.
