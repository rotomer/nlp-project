Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Accounting Policies The company has disclosed those accounting policies that it considers to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to its Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. The companys core activities relate to the development, manufacture and sale of thousands of products to numerous markets. Although the companys operations may be considered to be complex, management believes the accounting principles it utilizes to prepare its consolidated financial statements are relatively basic, are intended to result in the reporting of reasonably conservative amounts, and typically only are changed to comply with new standards promulgated by authoritative bodies. In all material respects, the accounting principles utilized by the company are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In applying its accounting principles, management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. As one would expect, the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts. These differences are usually minor and are included in the consolidated financial statements by management as soon as they are known. The individual estimates and assumptions generally do not involve a level of risk or uncertainty that would be material to the consolidated financial statements as a whole because, although numerous in number, they generally are relatively immaterial in amount. Many of these estimates and assumptions relate to current assets and liabilities and, accordingly, given the relatively short operating cycle of the company, they are reviewed and updated frequently. There are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time, such as the assumptions underlying the determination of the companys pension and postretirement obligations and related periodic cost, and the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, the expected long term rate of return on pension assets may be adjusted based on the emergence of different earnings trends or prospects, or expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit. Although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these long term estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results will emerge, such risk is mitigated by managements ability to make changes in these estimates and assumptions over the same long period. In preparing financial statements at any point in time, management is also periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. As discussed in Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is involved in a number of actions, governmental proceedings and claims related to product liability and environmental matters. In some actions, the claimants seek damages as well as other relief, which, if granted would require substantial expenditures. Management, with the assistance of counsel makes estimates, if determinable, of its probable liabilities and records such amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Such estimates may be an amount representing managements best estimate, or may be the minimum amount of a range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable. Disclosure is 14 made, when determinable, of the additional possible amount of loss on these claims, or if such estimate cannot be made, that fact is disclosed. The company and its counsel monitor developments related to these legal matters and, when appropriate, adjustments are made to recorded liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances. With respect to product liability claims, the company has substantial amounts of insurance available, and management with the assistance of counsel makes and records estimates of insurance recoverable for its claims liabilities. Such estimates are also monitored and modified as appropriate, based on current developments. While the company believes that the ultimate outcome of all of its actions, governmental proceedings and claims individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. While the company believes such a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact on the company. The company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in this section concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Debt, Other Financial Instruments, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The company does not have leveraged derivative positions. All special purpose entities utilized by the company (such as its captive insurance company) are consolidated in its results and have economic purpose. The company does not use special purpose vehicles for primary financing purposes. Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that the companys consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company. This is not to suggest that other general risk factors, such as changes in worldwide economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, achievement of corporate growth objectives, changes in material costs, performance of acquired businesses and others, could not adversely impact the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods. 15 Operating Results Sales: Sales in 2001 totaled $16.079 billion, compared with $16.724 billion in 2000 and $15.748 billion in 1999. In 2001, core volume (which excludes acquisition and divestiture impacts) declined by 3.5 percent. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 3.3 percent. In 2000, core volume grew 8.5 percent. Selling prices declined about 1.5 percent, mainly due to reductions in certain 3M electronic products both in the United States and internationally. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by about 2.5 percent. In the United States, sales in 2001 totaled $7.546 billion, down 4 percent from 2000. U.S. core volume declined 6.8 percent. Internationally, sales totaled $8.533 billion, down 3.8 percent from 2000. International core volume declined nearly 1 percent. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced international sales by 6.2 percent. In 2000, U.S. sales increased 4 percent. Volume rose 5 percent, while selling prices were down 1 percent. Internationally, sales rose 8 percent. Core volume increased 12 percent and selling prices were down 2 percent. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced international sales by 5 percent. Components of Sales Change 2001 2000 U.S. Intl. W.W.

Non recurring items of $569 million, principally related to the companys restructuring plan announced during the second quarter of 2001, were classified as a component of cost of sales ($249 million); selling, general and administrative expenses ($300 million); and research, development and related expenses ($20 million). Of this $569 million, $472 million related to employee severance and benefits, $80 million related to accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and $17 million related to other exit activities. In addition, cost of sales included other non recurring costs of $23 million related to acquisitions. Non recurring items included in the other expense (income) line within operating income included a $73 million reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual related to 3Ms successful appeal in January 2002 in an antitrust case brought by LePages Inc. On February 25, 2002, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals vacated its prior ruling and ordered a re hearing in May 2002 by the full court. However, the company continues to believe that it will ultimately prevail in the outcome of this matter. Also included within the other expense (income) line within operating income is a net gain of $15 million related to the sale of available for sale equity securities, partially offset by the write down of available for sale equity securities. In 2000, non recurring items reduced net income by $90 million, or 23 cents per diluted share. Operating income was reduced by $23 million, including costs of $208 million (reported in cost of sales) and gains of $185 million, included in the other expense (income) line within operating income. Non recurring costs in 2000 included $168 million of costs in the Specialty Material segment related to the companys phase out of perfluorooctanyl based chemistry products, a $20 million write down of corporate and unallocated assets, and $20 million of other non recurring expenses ($13 million related to acquisitions in the Electro and Communications segment). Major non cash costs included in the previously 16 mentioned items are $73 million of accelerated depreciation and $48 million of impairment losses, primarily related to production equipment used to manufacture products phased out in the Specialty Material segment. Non recurring gains in 2000 were largely related to asset dispositions, principally the sale of available for sale equity securities, and also included $50 million from the termination of a product distribution agreement in the Health Care segment. A cumulative effect of accounting change that related to a change in the companys revenue recognition policy was also recorded in 2000, reducing earnings by $75 million after tax. In 1999, non recurring items increased operating income by $100 million ($52 million after tax, or 13 cents per diluted share). These costs were included in the other expense (income) line within operating income. Non recurring items included a net gain of $147 million ($81 million after tax) related to gains on the divestitures of Eastern Heights Bank and certain health care businesses, net of an investment valuation adjustment. 1999 also included a charge of $73 million ($46 million after tax) related to an adverse jury verdict and legal fees associated with a lawsuit filed by LePages, Inc. In the third quarter of 1999, the company recorded a change in estimate that reduced 1998 restructuring charges by $26 million ($17 million after tax). The table below shows amounts for non recurring items in 2001, 2000 and 1999, as well as amounts excluding these items. Supplemental Consolidated Statement of Income Information Years ended December 31 Total (excluding (Millions, except Non recurring items non recurring items) per share amounts) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Net sales $ $ $ $16,079 $16,724 $15,748 Cost of sales 272 208 8,477 8,579 8,126 Selling, general and administrative expenses 300 3,761 3,963 3,712 Research, development and related expenses 20 1,064 1,101 1,056 Other expense (income) (88) (185) (100) (2) Operating income (loss) $(504) $ (23) $ 100 $2,777 $3,081 $2,856 Interest expense and (income) net 87 84 76 Income (loss) before income taxes, minority interest, and cumulative effect of accounting change (504) (23) 100 2,690 2,997 2,780 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (184) (8) 48 886 1,033 984 Effective tax rate 32.9% 34.5% 35.4% Minority interest (8) 62 92 85 Income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change $(312) $ (15) 52 $1,742 $1,872 $1,711 Cumulative effect of accounting change (75) Net income (loss) $(312) $ (90) $ 52 $1,742 $1,872 $1,711 Per share diluted (.78) (.23) .13 4.36 4.68 4.21 17 The following discussion excludes the impact of non recurring items in all years, except where indicated. (Percent of sales) 2001 2000 1999 Cost of sales 52.7 51.3 51.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.4 23.7 23.6 Research, development and related expenses 6.6 6.6 6.7 Operating income 17.3 18.4 18.1 Costs: In 2001, cost of sales was 52.7 percent of sales, up 1.4 percentage points from 2000. Gross margins were negatively affected by slowing worldwide market demand and negative currency impacts, partially offset by good manufacturing indirect cost control. In 2000, gross margins benefited from volume growth, productivity gains and lower employee benefit costs, but were negatively affected by raw material costs and currency effects. Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 23.4 percent of sales in 2001, 23.7 percent in 2000 and 23.6 percent in 1999. In 2001, these expenses benefited from indirect cost control and productivity gains related to restructuring actions. In 2000, these expenses reflected increased new product investments. SG&A expenses in 2000 benefited from lower employee benefit costs. Goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization, included in SG&A, totaled $67 million in 2001 and $44 million in 2000. Under the new "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" accounting standard (discussed later), this amortization will cease effective January 1, 2002. Excluding goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization, SG&A as a percent of sales for 2001 would total 23.0 percent, and for 2000 would total 23.4 percent. Operating income: Operating income totaled $2.777 billion in 2001, down 9.9 percent from 2000. Operating income was 17.3 percent of sales, down from 18.4 percent in 2000 and 18.1 percent in 1999. In 2001, slowing worldwide market demand and negative currency effects were partially offset by good indirect cost control. In 2000, volume growth and productivity gains drove most of the improvement in operating income. Lower employee benefit costs resulting from lower pension expense, primarily in the United States, increased operating profit margins in 2000 by an estimated five tenths of a percentage point. This benefit was more than offset by higher payroll costs and other inflationary impacts. The company estimates that currency effects reduced operating income by about $175 million in 2001, $78 million in 2000 and $18 million in 1999. In the United States, operating income in 2001 decreased about 11.5 percent and profit margins were down slightly more than one percentage point. In 2000, operating income decreased 3 percent and profit margins were down one percentage point. Internationally, operating income in 2001 decreased 9 percent and profit margins decreased slightly more than one percentage point. In 2000, operating income increased 16 percent and profit margins increased 1.4 percentage points. Interest expense and income: Interest expense was $124 million in 2001, compared with $111 million in 2000 and $109 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 reflected higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest income was $37 million in 2001, compared with $27 million in 2000 and $33 million in 1999. The higher level in 2001 reflected higher interest income due to larger average cash balances. 18 Provision for income taxes: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 32.9 percent in 2001, 34.5 percent in 2000 and 35.4 percent in 1999. Including non recurring items, 3Ms effective tax rate was 32.1 percent in 2001, compared with 34.5 percent in 2000 and 35.8 percent in 1999. The decrease in both 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to a decrease in the average effective tax rate for international operations, and in 2001 also reflected the impact of recurring tax credits on lower than expected profit levels. Minority interest: Excluding non recurring items in 2001, minority interest was $62 million, compared with $92 million in 2000 and $85 million in 1999. Minority interest represents the elimination of the non 3M ownership interests, primarily in Sumitomo 3M Limited and Dyneon LLC (in 1999 only). The decrease in 2001 was driven by lower profits in Sumitomo 3M. The increase in 2000 reflects higher profits in Sumitomo 3M, partially offset by a decrease as a result of 3Ms acquisition of the 46 percent minority interest in Dyneon in December of 1999. This acquisition is discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income: Net income totaled $1.742 billion, or $4.36 per diluted share, compared with $1.872 billion, or $4.68 per diluted share, in 2000, and $1.711 billion, or $4.21 per diluted share, in 1999. Per share income decreased 6.8 percent in 2001 and increased 11.2 percent in 2000. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, currency effects reduced net income by an estimated $94 million (24 cents per share), $55 million (14 cents per share) and $23 million (6 cents per share), respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of goods transferred between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce exchange rate risks. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased net income by an estimated $29 million, $21 million and $4 million, respectively. Employment: At December 31, 2001, employment totaled 71,669 people, a decrease of about 3,350 from year end 2000, due to both restructuring actions and attrition. In the first quarter of 2001, primarily related to three notable acquisitions, employment increased by about 2,650. Since March 31, 2001, employment has declined by 6,000 people, with 3,500 related to the restructuring plan, 1,500 due to the integration of recent acquisitions and 1,000 due to attrition. At December 31, 2000, employment totaled 75,026, an increase of about 4,500 from year end 1999, with about 3,400 of the increase due to acquisitions. Sales per employee in local currencies decreased about 3 percent in 2001, increased about 7 percent in 2000, and increased about 10 percent in 1999. Restructuring charges and other non recurring items: During the first half of 2001, the company developed and announced a restructuring plan that consolidates certain operations and streamlines the organization to increase speed and productivity. In June 2001, the company completed the identification of all significant actions to be taken and obtained final approvals from the appropriate level of management. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company obtained approvals for certain additional actions. The companys current estimate for total charges, principally related to the restructuring plan, is about $750 million (including pre tax charges of $569 million taken in 2001 that related principally to these actions). These charges are discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 In connection with its restructuring plan, the company expects to eliminate a total of about 6,000 positions, with most of these reductions occurring by June 30, 2002. Through December 31, 2001, the company had eliminated about 3,500 positions. These positions represent a wide range of functions throughout the company. Of the 6,000 employment reduction for the total plan, about 40 percent will occur in the United States, 35 percent in Europe, and the balance in other international areas. All business segments will be impacted directly and also indirectly through reduced allocations of corporate staff service costs. The impact of the total restructuring, including the allocated portion of restructured staff services, is estimated by segment as follows: Industrial, 35 percent; Electro and Communications, 20 percent; Transportation, Graphics and Safety, 20 percent; Health Care, 10 percent; Consumer and Office, 10 percent; and Specialty Material, 5 percent. These estimates are provided only as a frame of reference as to the order of magnitude by segment. The restructuring costs have not been recorded in the individual business segments, which enhances comparability and reflects management focus on ongoing results. In 2002, the company expects to take additional charges of about $200 million. The remaining charges will include accelerated depreciation related to consolidating or downsizing certain manufacturing operations, employee severance and benefit costs, and other incremental restructuring related exit costs. Related to this restructuring plan, the company estimates it saved $80 million in the second half of 2001. The company expects additional savings of approximately $300 million in 2002, with a somewhat greater rate of savings in the second half than in the first half of the year. The vast majority of the savings will be reduced employee costs. The 2001 savings were most prominent in SG&A, with cost of sales benefits occurring in late 2001 and into 2002. Numerous factors may create offsets to these savings, such as the potential for continued weakness in sales volumes, normal increases in compensation and benefits, and other inflationary pressures. The company has not discontinued any major product lines as a result of this restructuring. Employee severance and benefit charges totaling $472 million were taken during 2001. These charges were taken in the quarter when management approved the plans and after severance benefits had been communicated to the employees. While the majority of employee severance already has been accrued, additional communications to affected international employees will occur in the first half of 2002, resulting in additional charges. Of the companys remaining current liability at December 31, 2001, $185 million is classified in current liabilities (payroll) and $13 million is classified in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company classified $124 million of the current years charges as long term liabilities. Special termination pension and medical benefits, aggregating $62 million, were offered to eligible employees. These benefits will generally be paid over their life expectancies. In addition, the company estimates that $62 million of deferred separation pay will be paid in 2003 and beyond. The company also recorded $8 million of non cash stock option expense due to the reclassification of certain employees age 50 and older to retiree status, resulting in a modification of their original stock option awards for accounting purposes. The current liabilities and a portion of the non current liabilities will be funded through cash provided by operations, with additional funding for non current liabilities provided through established pension and postretirement trust funds. 20 Selected information related to these 2001 charges follows.

Goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, are subject immediately to the non amortization and amortization provisions of this statement, while existing goodwill and other indefinite lived assets will no longer be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Goodwill will be subject to an impairment test at least annually. A preliminary review indicated that no impairment existed at December 31, 2001. Additional information regarding recent accounting pronouncements of the FASB, including Statement No. 142, is included under "Significant Accounting Policies New Accounting Pronouncements", in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization totaled 12 cents per diluted share in 2001 and 9 cents per diluted share in 2000. The impact of Statement No. 142 on previously reported results, and the impact by business segment, follow. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Tradenames Supplemental Consolidated Statement of Income Information Years ended December 31 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) 2001 2000 Reported net income $1,430 $1,782 Add back: Goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization net 51 32 Adjusted net income $1,481 $1,814 Earnings per share basic Reported net income $ 3.63 $ 4.50 Goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization net .13 .08 Adjusted net income $ 3.76 $ 4.58 Earnings per share diluted Reported net income $ 3.58 $ 4.45 Goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization net .12 .09 Adjusted net income $ 3.70 $ 4.54 Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Tradenames Supplemental Business Segment Information Asset balance Amortization at December 31 Year Year (Millions) 2001 2000 2001 2000 Transportation, Graphics and Safety $ 169 $ 90 $ 13 $ 5 Health Care 344 136 22 15 Industrial 17 14 1 3 Consumer and Office 19 27 2 2 Electro and Communications 361 296 23 14 Specialty Material 126 118 6 5 Total Company $1,036 $ 681 $ 67 $ 44 Income taxes (12) (12) Minority interest (4) Amortization net of income taxes and minority interest $ 51 $ 32 22 Other new accounting pronouncements: In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations". SFAS No. 141 applies to all business combinations with a closing date after June 30, 2001. The most significant changes made by SFAS No. 141 are: 1) requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and 2) establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", which must be adopted no later than January 1, 2003. This statement establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost. The company is reviewing the requirements of this standard. Although the company expects that this standard will not materially affect its financial position or results of operations, it has not yet finalized its determination of the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which will be adopted by the company on January 1, 2002. The company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. This standard broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions, thus the recognition of discontinued operations is expected to become more common under this new standard. The company will adopt Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products" effective January 1, 2002. This statement addresses whether certain consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendors products is an adjustment to selling prices or a cost. It is estimated that this statement will result in Consumer and Office segment annual net sales and advertising cost (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) being reduced by approximately $25 million annually for years 1999 through 2001. This statement would have no effect on the companys net income or its financial position. Performance by Business Segment Disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures, including discussion of non recurring items, are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Transportation, Graphics and Safety Markets (22 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides products for transportation safety, commercial graphics, respiratory protection, optical display, automotive and personal safety. Sales in 2001 totaled $3.526 billion, up slightly from 2000. Operating income decreased about 10 percent in 2001, excluding $7 million of non recurring acquisition costs in 2001. This segment increased volume about 7 percent (about 3 percent excluding acquisitions). Growth was strong in the optical films business and occupational health and environmental safety business. 3Ms optical films business broadened its product offerings with the acquisition of two touch screen companies in 2000 and early 2001. Operating income margins declined due to soft overall sales and due to lower margins in acquired businesses. 23 Health Care Markets (21 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides innovative products that improve peoples health and well being, including dental, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and health information systems. Sales totaled $3.419 billion, up about 9 percent from 2000 (up about 4 percent adjusted for acquisitions). Growth was led by pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic products, and health information systems. In early 2001, 3M combined its German dental business with ESPE Dental AG, a leading German supplier of crowns, bridges, and other dental products. As controlling shareholder (the minority shareholders have no participating rights), 3M consolidates this company into its results. Health Care operating income was up about 23 percent in 2001, excluding a $50 million pre tax benefit in 2000 from the termination of a product distribution agreement and excluding $10 million of non recurring acquisition costs in 2001. Factory productivity and lower SG&A spending both contributed to this operating income improvement. In September 2001, the pharmaceutical division signed an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company to collaborate on resiquimod, a potential breakthrough treatment for genital herpes. Resiquimod is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, and moving toward an anticipated 2004 submission date to the FDA. 3M received $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from Eli Lilly in consideration for research and development efforts. The majority of the $100 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2002 through 2004, as the majority of the future research and development expenditures are expected to be incurred during this period. Industrial Markets (20 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides tapes, coated and nonwoven abrasives, and specialty adhesives. Sales totaled $3.199 billion, down about 9 percent from 2000. Volume declined about 7.5 percent, reflecting weakness in most manufacturing sectors of the economy in 2001. Operating income decreased about 19 percent to $518 million. Aggressive cost controls helped minimize the effect of lower sales volumes on profit margins. This market has implemented structural changes to improve its competitive position. For example, this market consolidated and shifted manufacturing operations globally to shorten cycle times, serve customers better and employ capital more efficiently. Consumer and Office Markets (17 percent of consolidated sales): This market supplies products that help keep homes cleaner, offices organized and buildings maintained. Sales totaled $2.724 billion, down about 4 percent from 2000. Despite a volume decline of about 3 percent related to difficult market conditions, this segment was able to increase its operating income by about 3 percent through cost improvement actions. This segment experienced excellent growth in the construction and home improvement business. Overall growth was held back by softness in most other areas. Electro and Communications Markets (14 percent of consolidated sales): This market supplies connecting, splicing, insulating and protective products for the electronics, communications and electrical industries. Sales totaled $2.171 billion, down 12 percent from 2000 (down about 18 percent after adjusting for acquisitions). This segment experienced the effects of sharply lower global activity in the electronics and communications industries, and was also penalized by strong negative currency impacts. Operating income for this market decreased 46 percent, negatively impacted by declining sales and acquisition impacts. In 2000, 3M acquired 91 percent (subsequently increased to 93 percent) of Quante AG, a German based telecommunications supplier, and purchased the multi layer integrated circuit packaging line of W. L. Gore and Associates. In early 2001, 3M also completed the acquisition of Robinson Nugent, Inc., a U.S. based manufacturer of electronic interconnects. 24 Specialty Material Markets (6 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides high value materials for demanding applications in chemical processing, automotive, electronics, telecommunications and other industries. Sales totaled $1.022 billion, down 15 percent from 2000. In May 2000, 3M announced its intent to substantially phase out production by the end of 2000 of the perfluorooctanyl based chemistry used to produce certain repellents and surfactant products. The affected product lines represented about $300 million in annual sales with an operating income margin around 20 percent. Overall sales were affected by this phase out. The company has introduced alternatives for some applications and industry segments, including carpet protection. Operating income in 2000 includes non recurring costs of $168 million related to the companys decision to phase out the perfluorooctanyl based chemistry products. Excluding these non recurring items in 2000, operating income declined 37 percent in 2001, primarily impacted by the 13.5 percent volume decline. Performance by Geographic Area Financial information, including discussion of non recurring items, related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Non recurring pre tax losses of $504 million in 2001, primarily related to the restructuring, are included in Eliminations and Other (not assigned to a specific geographic area). United States (47 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in the United States totaled $7.546 billion, down about 4 percent from 2000. U.S. core volume declined 6.8 percent. Operating income was down about 11.5 percent, impacted by volume declines. In 2000, good volume growth and productivity gains helped results, while increased new product investments held back overall profit growth. Operating income was 13.6 percent of sales in 2001, down from 14.8 percent in 2000. Europe and Middle East (25 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in Europe and the Middle East totaled $3.960 billion, up slightly from 2000. Local currency sales increased about 3.5 percent on a reported basis and decreased about 2 percent excluding acquisitions. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3 percent. Despite significant unfavorable currency effects, operating income decreased by only 3 percent. Operating income was 14.4 percent of sales, compared with 14.9 percent of sales in 2000. Asia Pacific (19 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in Asia Pacific totaled $3.043 billion, down about 8.6 percent from 2000. Volume in the Asia Pacific area increased 2.4 percent in 2001. Selling prices decreased 1.7 percent, while currency translation decreased sales by 9.3 percent. Operating income was 26.5 percent of sales, down from 28.9 percent in 2001, affected by a significant slowdown in the electronics businesses and unfavorable currency effects. In Japan, home of 3Ms largest international company, volume increased about 1.5 percent. Volume in Asia outside Japan increased 3.3 percent in 2001. Latin America, Canada and Africa (9 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in Latin America, Canada and Africa combined totaled $1.496 billion, down about 4.4 percent from 2000. In Latin America, local currency sales increased 3.4 percent. Currency reduced Latin America sales by about 8.3 percent. The peso devaluation in Argentina did not have a material impact on the company. In Canada, local currency sales increased 1.6 percent. Operating income for Latin America, Canada and Africa was 24.1 percent of sales, essentially unchanged from 2000. 25 Financial Condition and Liquidity 3Ms financial condition remained strong in 2001. The companys key inventory index was 3.1 months, down from 3.4 months at year end 2000. The accounts receivable index was 59 days, down one day from 2000. The current ratio was 1.4, up from 1.3 at the end of 2000. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $3.078 billion in 2001, compared with $2.326 billion in 2000 and $3.081 billion in 1999. In 2001, working capital reductions drove the increase. In 2000, certain working capital increases, partially driven by the 10 percent increase in sales volume, reduced cash provided by operating activities. It is estimated that restructuring related cash outflows will approximate $300 million in 2002. The current liabilities and a portion of the non current liabilities related to the restructuring liability will be funded through cash provided by operations, with additional funding for non current liabilities provided through established pension and postretirement trust funds. As discussed in the "Performance by Business Segment" section of this report, 3M received $100 million from Eli Lilly and Company in the fourth quarter of 2001 relating to a pharmaceutical agreement. The majority of the $100 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2002 through 2004, as the majority of the future research and development expenditures are expected to be incurred during this period. In 2001, 3M made cash payments of $159 million related to its 2001 restructuring plan. Related to its 1998 restructuring plan, the company made cash payments of $28 million in 2000 and $228 million in 1999. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, 3Ms insurance recoveries, net of claims paid, related to the mammary implant matter totaled $101 million, $49 million and $93 million, respectively. Most of the companys implant liabilities have been paid; accordingly, receipt of related insurance recoveries will increase future cash flows. For a more detailed discussion, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $980 million, a decrease of about 12 percent from 2000. This followed an increase of about 6 percent in 2000 compared with 1999. These investments are helping to meet product demand and increase manufacturing efficiency. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment totaled approximately $100 million in each of the last three years. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses totaled $218 million, $472 million and $374 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. There were three notable business combinations in 2001. 3M acquired MicroTouch Systems Inc., a touch screen manufacturer, for $158 million in cash, net of cash acquired. 3M also acquired Robinson Nugent, Inc., a telecommunications supplier, in exchange for 1,124,135 shares of 3M common stock. 3M also combined its German dental business (3M Inter Unitek GmbH, an existing 3M subsidiary) with ESPE Dental AG, a dental products manufacturer. 3M Inter Unitek GmbH acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of ESPE Dental AG in exchange for 43 percent ownership in 3M Inter Unitek GmbH and $25 million, net of cash acquired. Acquisition activity in 2001 also included the purchase, for less than $50 million, of five smaller companies that had combined annual sales of less than $50 million. Acquisitions in 2000 included the purchase of 91 percent (subsequently increased to 93 percent) of Quante AG (a telecommunications supplier); the purchase of the multi layer integrated circuit packaging line of W.L. Gore and Associates; and the acquisition of seven smaller businesses. These seven smaller businesses had a combined purchase price of less than $125 million and combined annual sales of less than $75 million. In 1999, 3M completed one notable business combination, with a purchase price of about $340 million, that related to the acquisition of the outstanding minority interest in Dyneon LLC. In 26 addition, seven other acquisitions had a combined purchase price of less than $50 million and had combined annual sales of less than $50 million. Cash proceeds from the sale of businesses totaled $11 million, $1 million and $249 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash proceeds in 1999 principally related to divestitures of Eastern Heights Bank, the cardiovascular systems business and other health care businesses. Purchases of investments totaled $12 million in both 2001 and 2000, and $56 million in 1999. These purchases include patents and equity investments. In 2001, the decrease in net short term debt of $20 million includes the portion of short term debt with original maturities of three months or less. Repayment of debt of $1.564 billion includes $948 million of commercial paper having original maturities greater than three months. Proceeds from debt of $1.693 billion includes $1.081 billion of commercial paper having original maturities greater than three months. Total debt at December 31, 2001, was $2.893 billion, up from $2.837 billion at year end 2000. Total debt was 32 percent of total capital, compared with 30 percent at year end 2000. In December 2000, the company issued approximately $350 million of debt securities, remarketable annually (with a final maturity date of December 2010), which is classified as short term debt. In October 2000, the company filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the potential offering of debt securities of up to $1.5 billion. After the shelf registration became effective, the company, in May 2001, established under the shelf a medium term notes program through which up to $1.4 billion of medium term notes may be offered. 3M plans to use the net proceeds from future issuances of debt securities under these registrations for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt or the financing of possible acquisitions. As of December 31, 2001, $550 million of medium term notes had been issued under the medium term note program and another $56 million of debt securities had been issued directly from the shelf, aggregating $606 million debt securities offered for 2001 under the shelf. The company expects to issue three year notes of approximately $400 million under its medium term note program in March 2002. The companys liquidity position remains strong. Primary short term liquidity needs are provided through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. At year end 2001, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $876 million and averaged approximately $1 billion during 2001. Medium term note shelf borrowing capacity, as discussed previously, totaled $850 million at year end 2001. Credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a $565 million, 364 day credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks. The facility provides for up to $65 million in letters of credit ($59 million of which was outstanding at December 31, 2001). An additional letter of credit of $266 million is dedicated to the reacquisition of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH shares issued in connection with the ESPE Dental AG business combination, with the shares subject to put options exercisable by the former shareholders of ESPE Dental AG from the date of acquisition until January 10, 2003. Committed credit facilities of $93 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations. The company also has uncommitted lines of credit totaling $125 million. The company expects to renew the committed lines of credit facilities in 2002. The company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations, if necessary. Certain debt agreements ($565 million of short term lines of credit, $350 million of dealer remarketable securities, and the $303 million of ESOP debt) 27 have ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. The company currently has an AA/Aa1 rating. 3M entered into put/call option agreements with former shareholders of ESPE Dental AG. Under the put agreements, 3M would be required to purchase the 43 percent minority interest in 3M Inter Unitek GmbH from former shareholders in ESPE Dental AG for cash of approximately $266 million. This aggregate put option amount is expected to approximate the recorded minority interest liability at the date of exercise. These put options became exercisable on the acquisition date and expire on January 10, 2003. The call options, if exercised, would require the minority shareholders to sell their 3M Inter Unitek GmbH shares to 3M, based upon a formula set forth in the agreement. These call options become exercisable on December 20, 2003, and expire on June 30, 2004. A summary of the companys significant contractual obligations follows. Capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations, and other contractual obligations are not significant. The ESOP debt guarantee is included in long term debt. Payments due by year Contractual Obligations 2003 2005 After (Millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 2006 Long term debt (including current portion) $1,557 $ 37 $716 $ 76 $ 728 Leases 339 79 115 48 97 Total contractual cash obligations $1,896 $116 $831 $124 $ 825 Repurchases of 3M common stock totaled $1.322 billion in 2001, compared with $814 million in 2000 and $825 million in 1999. Repurchases were made to support the companys management stock option plan, its general employees stock purchase plan, and for other corporate purposes. In November 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the companys common stock. This share repurchase authorization is effective from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. In 2001, under preceding authorizations, the company purchased about 12 million shares. In 2000 and 1999, a reduction in annual weighted average diluted shares outstanding (including the effects of repurchases, issuances and dilution) resulted in a benefit of 8 cents per diluted share and 2 cents per diluted share, respectively. There was no impact in 2001. Cash dividends paid to stockholders in 2001 totaled $948 million, or $2.40 per share. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2002, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock to 62 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.48 per share. This marks the 44th consecutive year of dividend increases. Future Outlook Despite the near term economic challenges, 3M is poised for greater success via fundamental changes aimed at accelerating growth, increasing productivity and improving asset turnover. 3M expects to emerge from the current economic situation as both a stronger and leaner enterprise. 3M launched several initiatives in 2001 that minimized the impact of economic challenges. 3Ms Indirect Cost Control initiative saved over $500 million compared with 2000. 3M expects another $150 million of savings from this initiative in 2002. 3Ms Sourcing initiative saved over $100 million in 2001, with another $150 million expected in 2002. Other initiatives include eProductivity, where 3M believes it has a significant digitization 28 opportunity, and expects $50 million of benefits in 2002; 3M Acceleration, where R&D resources are reallocated to larger, more global projects; and Six Sigma, which focuses on higher growth, lower costs and greater cash flow, and from which 3M expects over $200 million of operating income benefits in 2002. These initiatives, combined with the companys restructuring plan, are expected to lower costs by more than $1 billion during the 2001 to 2002 time period, even recognizing the initiatives overlapping impact. These benefits have been built into the earnings projections discussed next. For 2002 in total, earnings per share, excluding non recurring items, are expected to be within a range of $4.60 to $5.05 per share. The lower end of the range assumes volume declines of 2 percent, while the top end assumes volume increases of 3 percent. The high end of the range assumes some global economic recovery in the second half of the year. However, first quarter 2002 will be a tougher comparison given that our businesses internationally remained quite strong at the beginning of 2001. Earnings for the first quarter of 2002, excluding non recurring items, are expected to be within a range of $1.05 to $1.20 per share. The lower end of the range assumes volume declines of 6 percent, while the top end assumes volume declines of 3 percent. These ranges assume a positive 12 cent annual impact due to ceasing goodwill and indefinite lived tradename amortization in accordance with the companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002. Capital expenditures are expected to total less than $1 billion in 2002. Financial Instruments The company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection swaps and forward physical contracts. A variance/co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2001. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. Based on this analysis of the interest rate risks, possible changes in interest rates would not adversely impact after tax earnings by a material amount ($6 million at December 31, 2001). Based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks, possible changes in exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by $57 million. This model analyzed more than 20 different currencies, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The company used a different modeling dataset in 2001, but still used the variance/co variance technique and used a 12 month 29 time horizon (versus the one month time horizon used in 2000). The company does not believe a statistical modeling comparison to 2000 is beneficial, as the company increased both the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges in 2001. The company also believes it is impracticable (considering cost benefit criteria) to perform a comparable calculation for 2000. The company is increasingly striving to move costs outside the United States to naturally protect 3M from currency fluctuations. In 2001, the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings. However, this hedging program will not make 3M immune to currency impacts. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess commodity risks. The sensitivity analysis technique used evaluates the effect that changes in the market value of commodities will have on the companys commodity derivative instruments. At year end 2001 and 2000, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying commodity price, was not material ($4 million after tax at December 31, 2001). The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge about one percent of this purchased components and materials exposure. The global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $25 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge about 10 percent of this energy exposure. The Euro Conversion In February 1997, the company created a European Monetary Union (EMU) Steering Committee and project teams. The objective of these teams was to ensure a smooth transition to EMU for the company. The scope of the teams efforts included (i) assessing the euros impact on the companys business and pricing strategies for customers and suppliers, and (ii) ensuring that the companys business processes and information technology (IT) systems could process transactions in euros and local currencies during the transition period and would be converted to the euro by December 31, 2001, in the participating countries. During 2001, all the business processes for all the euroland companies were converted successfully to the euro; all transactions are now denominated in the euro as the base currency, and records are maintained in euros. The company anticipates that the complete conversion activity, including residual activities in 2002, will cost approximately $30 million. The Europe and Middle East area contributed 25 percent of consolidated sales and 21 percent of consolidated operating income (excluding non recurring items) in 2001. The participating countries accounted for 68 percent of the companys sales in the Europe and Middle East area in 2001. The company believes that the euro will, over time, increase price competition for the companys products across Europe due to cross border price transparency. The company also believes that the adverse effects of increased price competition will be offset somewhat by new business opportunities and efficiencies. The company, however, is not able to estimate the net long term impact of the euro introduction on the company. The euro introduction has not had a material impact on the companys overall currency risk. The company anticipates the euro will simplify financial issues related to cross border trade in the European Union and reduce the transaction costs and administrative time necessary to manage this trade and related risks. The company believes that the associated savings will not be material to corporate results. 30 Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of words like "plan," "expect," "aim," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "will," "should," "could" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: * The effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic conditions. The company operates in more than 60 countries and derives more than half of its revenues from outside the United States. The companys business may be affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region; social, political or labor conditions in a specific country or region; or potential adverse foreign tax consequences. * Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations. Because the company derives more than half its revenues from outside the United States, its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings and results of operations could be adversely affected if the United States dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. * The companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to: identify viable new products; successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals; obtain adequate intellectual property protection; or gain market acceptance of new products. * The companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs of purchased components and materials due to market demand, currency exchange risks, shortages and other factors. The company depends on various components and materials for the manufacturing of its products. Although the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining components and materials, it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the companys receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. In addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand, currency risks, or shortages, or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company. * The possibility that acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations. As part of the companys strategy for growth, the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions, 31 divestitures and strategic alliances. However, there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company. * The company is the subject of various legal proceedings. The current estimates of the potential impact on the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for its legal proceedings and claims are predictions made by the company about the future and should be considered forward looking statements. These estimates could change in the future. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company, see the discussion of "Legal Proceedings" in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Debt, Other Financial Instruments, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy. All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The company does not have leveraged derivative positions.
