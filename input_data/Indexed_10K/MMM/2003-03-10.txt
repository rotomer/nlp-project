ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of words like "plan," "expect," "aim," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "will," "should," "could" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: * The effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic conditions. The company operates in more than 60 countries and derives more than half of its revenues from outside the United States. The companys business may be affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region; social, political or labor conditions in a specific country or region; or potential adverse foreign tax consequences. * Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations. Because the company derives more than half its revenues from outside the United States, its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings and results of operations could be adversely affected if the United States dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. * The companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to: identify viable new products; obtain adequate intellectual property protection; gain market acceptance of new products, or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals. As with any pharmaceutical under development, there are substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review. There are no guarantees that products will receive regulatory approvals or prove to be commercially successful. * The companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs of purchased components and materials due to market demand, currency exchange risks, shortages and other factors. The company depends on various components and materials for the manufacturing of its products. Although the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining components and materials, it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the companys receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. In addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand, currency risks, or shortages, or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company. * The possibility that acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations. As part of the companys strategy for growth, the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliances. However, there can be no absolute assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company. 17 * The company is the subject of various legal proceedings. The current estimates of the potential impact on the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for its legal proceedings and claims are predictions made by the company about the future and should be considered forward looking statements. These estimates could change in the future. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company, see the discussion of "Legal Proceedings" in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES As stated in our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, potential asset impairment issues, and the companys pension and postretirement obligations. Legal Proceedings: The companys core activities relate to the development, manufacture and sale of thousands of products to numerous markets. While this risk dispersion provides a measure of overall stability, it also results in legal risks in some areas. The company records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability probably will arise. The company also records receivables for the probable amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the companys insurance program in those instances. The company cannot always definitively determine possible liabilities that exceed recorded amounts related to the legal proceedings to which it is a party. There can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges, whether related to products liability, antitrust, or other litigation, environmental matters, or other actions, in excess of presently recorded liabilities. However, the company believes it unlikely, based upon the nature of the legal proceedings and its current knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances, that the possible liabilities exceeding recorded amounts would be material individually or in the aggregate to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Known legal risks include the ultimate collection of breast implant insurance receivables (a matter currently in dispute with the companys insurance carriers), respirator/mask/asbestos insurance receivables collection and probable liabilities, and an outstanding lawsuit filed by LePages Incorporated that extends back to 1997. Summary amounts concerning the breast implant and respirator/mask/asbestos litigation follow. At December 31 2002 2001 2000 (Millions) Breast implant receivables $339 $406 $519 Breast implant liabilities $ 5 $ 20 $ 32 Respirator/Mask/Asbestos receivables $264 $223 $155 Respirator/Mask/Asbestos liabilities $161 $156 $108 At December 31, 2002, the company has accrued receivables of $339 million relating to breast implants. Of this $339 million, $16 million represents settled but yet to be received amounts, while $323 million has been contested by insurance carriers. The company believes that it is likely to obtain relief in the Minnesota Supreme Court. If the Minnesota Supreme Court does not grant relief as anticipated, the company could be effectively deprived of significant and potentially material insurance coverage for breast implant claims. As part of the companys efforts to recover the amounts contested by the insurance carriers, the company also initiated an arbitration proceeding in London, England, to recover insurance coverage for breast implant liability and costs from claims made insurance carriers. The arbitration hearing will first consider whether the policy provides insurance coverage for the companys breast implant liability and costs. If the panel favorably decides the coverage question for the company, it will then determine the amount of coverage in a subsequent hearing later in 2003. 18 The companys remaining respirator/mask/asbestos liability is $161 million at December 31, 2002. This estimate represents the companys best estimate of its liability. If amounts are paid in settlement of claims or if any damages are ultimately assessed against the company in current or future litigation, a substantial portion of such amounts is expected to be covered by the companys product liability insurance. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of proceeds to be received under the companys various insurance policies, including (i) the timing of payments made in settlement of claims; (ii) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; and (iii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. There can be no certainty that the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of recovery from its insurers. 3M has not recorded any liability for the LePages Incorporated litigation as of December 31, 2002. 3M expects to prevail in this litigation, but if 3M does not prevail, 3M would incur a pre tax charge of approximately $85 million. 3M would also be potentially liable for LePages attorneys fees and costs. Potential Asset Impairment Issues: There are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit. Although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these long term estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results will emerge, such risk is mitigated by managements ability to make changes in these estimates and assumptions over the same long period. 3M has approximately $1.9 billion of goodwill that, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. A portion of this goodwill (approximately $220 million) is in 3Ms telecommunications business, which the company believes will maintain its value. However, if unanticipated events impact this sector for an extended period of time, it could create future impairment losses. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: Pension expense impacted 2002 earnings by 16 cents per diluted share compared with pension expense of 8 cents per diluted share in 2001. The company expects pension expense to increase approximately another 10 cents per diluted share in 2003, largely attributed to unrecognized losses on pension assets related to equity market weakness the last few years. In accounting for pension and postretirement benefits, costs and related liabilities are developed using actuarial valuations. These valuations include key assumptions determined by management, including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the United States pension plan expense calculation for 2003, the companys long term rate of return on asset assumption remains at 9 percent and its year end 2002 discount rate assumption is 6.75 percent (which is used for 2003 expense calculations), which represents a half percentage point reduction from the year end 2001 discount rate. The discount rate decrease is consistent with changes in high quality long term corporate bond indices. The expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (approximately 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income), past performance, and other factors. Estimates and assumptions concerning the companys pension and postretirement obligations and related periodic cost can be found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Material changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in the discount rates, changes in the expected long term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to these plans and other factors. A quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact 3Ms pension expense by approximately $32 million on a pre tax basis. A quarter percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return would impact 3Ms pension expense by approximately $23 million on a pre tax basis. 19 Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that the companys consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company. This is not to suggest that other general risk factors, such as changes in worldwide economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, achievement of corporate growth objectives, changes in material costs, performance of acquired businesses and others, could not adversely impact the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods. OPERATING RESULTS Overview: Net income totaled $1.974 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, compared with $1.430 billion, or $3.58 per diluted share, in 2001, and $1.782 billion, or $4.45 per diluted share, in 2000. In the first half of 2002, net income was impacted by non recurring charges of $108 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, related to the companys restructuring program that was approved in June 2001. In 2002, currency effects reduced earnings by 8 cents per diluted share, while the adoption of a new accounting standard resulting in the cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived intangible asset amortization increased earnings by 12 cents per diluted share. In 2001, net income was impacted by non recurring charges of $312 million, or 78 cents per diluted share, primarily related to the restructuring program approved in June 2001. In 2000, net income was impacted by non recurring charges of $90 million, or 23 cents per diluted share. Additional details concerning non recurring items follow. Non recurring items: In January 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures" a rule directed by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. This rule requires public companies that disclose or release non GAAP financial measures to include the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to provide a reconciliation of the disclosed non GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, and requires companies to furnish earnings releases or similar announcements to the Commission on Form 8 K. This rule will apply to all subject disclosures as of March 28, 2003. The rule also provides guidance on what constitutes "non recurring, infrequent, or unusual" as applied to specific financial transactions or events. The company currently provides reconciliations of its disclosed non GAAP financial reporting to the most comparable GAAP financial reporting. In addition to Regulation G, the SEC amended Item 10 of Regulation S K to provide additional guidance to registrants that include non GAAP financial measures in SEC filings. This guidance would prohibit the presentation of certain non GAAP financial measures that exclude from reported results non recurring, infrequent or unusual items when the nature of the charge or gain is such that is it reasonably likely to recur within two years or there was a similar charge or gain within the prior two years. This guidance could result in changes in the companys future presentation of non GAAP financial measures. In 2002, non recurring charges reduced operating income by $202 million and net income by $108 million. These charges principally related to employee severance and benefit costs, accelerated depreciation charges, and other associated exit costs under the companys restructuring plan announced in June 2001. These charges are included in cost of sales ($121 million); selling, general and administrative expenses ($77 million); and research, development and related expenses ($4 million). Of the total 2002 charges, $111 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, $47 million related to accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment (incremental charges resulting from shortened depreciable lives of affected assets, primarily related to downsizing or consolidating manufacturing operations), and $44 million related to other exit activities. Other exit activities included incremental costs and contractual obligations for items such as lease termination payments and other facility exit costs (such as demolition of buildings, inventory disposals, other) incurred as a direct result of the plan. Additional information concerning non recurring items is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and elsewhere herein. 20 In 2001, non recurring items reduced operating income by $504 million and net income by $312 million, or 78 cents per diluted share. Non recurring items of $569 million, principally related to the companys restructuring plan approved in June 2001, were included in cost of sales ($249 million); selling, general and administrative expenses ($300 million); and research, development and related expenses ($20 million). Of this $569 million, $472 million related to employee severance and benefits, $80 million related to accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and $17 million related to other exit activities. In addition, cost of sales included other non recurring costs of $23 million related to acquisitions. Non recurring items included in the other expense (income) line within operating income included $73 million of income due to the reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual related to 3Ms successful appeal in January 2002 in an antitrust case brought by LePages Inc. On February 25, 2002, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals vacated its prior ruling and ordered a re hearing in May 2002 by the full court. Oral arguments on the appeal were heard on October 30, 2002, and the company expects a decision in 2003. However, the company continues to believe that it will ultimately prevail in the outcome of this matter. Also included within the other expense (income) line within operating income is a net gain of $15 million related to the sale of available for sale equity securities, partially offset by the write down of permanently impaired available for sale equity securities. In 2000, non recurring items reduced net income by $90 million, or 23 cents per diluted share. Operating income was reduced by $23 million, including costs of $208 million (reported in cost of sales) and gains of $185 million, and reported in the other expense (income) line within operating income. Non recurring costs in 2000 included $168 million of costs in the Specialty Material segment related to the companys phase out of perfluorooctanyl based chemistry products, a $20 million write down of corporate and unallocated assets, and $20 million of other non recurring expenses ($13 million related to acquisitions in the Electro and Communications segment). Major non cash costs included in the previously mentioned items were $73 million of accelerated depreciation and $48 million of impairment losses, primarily related to production equipment used to manufacture products phased out in the Specialty Material segment. Non recurring gains in 2000 were largely related to asset dispositions, principally the sale of available for sale equity securities, and also included $50 million from the termination of a product distribution agreement in the Health Care segment. A cumulative effect of accounting change that related to a change in the companys revenue recognition policy was also recorded in 2000, reducing net income by $75 million. Pro forma amounts (excluding non recurring items): The company believes that discussion of results excluding significant non recurring items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The pro forma amounts (which exclude non recurring items) that follow are not in accordance with, or preferable to, amounts determined in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reference should be made to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes for additional information concerning non recurring items, and for additional information on amounts determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There is discussion of operating measures that exclude non recurring items within this "Operating Results" section. The determination of non recurring items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. An (#) is used to cross reference such subsequent discussion to this paragraph. 21 The tables that follow show amounts excluding non recurring items, non recurring items, and the reported amounts for years 2002, 2001 and 2000.

In 2002, core volume (which excludes acquisition and divestiture impacts) increased 1.0 percent. Acquisitions increased net sales by four tenths of one percent. Selling prices were up two tenths of one percent. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar increased worldwide net sales by one tenth of one percent. In the United States, net sales for 2002 totaled $7.426 billion, with core volume down 1.6 percent. International net sales for 2002 totaled $8.906 billion (up 4.4 percent in U.S. dollars), with core volume up 3.2 percent. In 2001, core volume declined by 3.5 percent. Acquisitions increased net sales by 2.6 percent. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 3.3 percent. In the United States, sales totaled $7.523 billion, down 4 percent from 2000. U.S. core volume declined 6.8 percent. Internationally, sales totaled $8.531 billion, down 3.8 percent from 2000. International core volume declined seven tenths of one percent. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced international sales by 6.2 percent. Costs: Reported (Percent of sales) 2002 2001 2000 Cost of sales 52.0 54.5 52.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.8 25.1 23.6 Research, development and related expenses 6.5 6.8 6.6 Operating income 18.7 14.2 18.3 Excluding non recurring items (#) (Percent of Sales) 2002 2001 2000 Cost of sales 51.3 52.8 51.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.3 23.3 23.6 Research, development and related expenses 6.5 6.6 6.6 Operating income 19.9 17.3 18.4 Cost of sales for 2002 was 52.0 percent of net sales, down 2.5 percentage points from 2001. Excluding non recurring charges, cost of sales for 2002 was 51.3 percent(#) of sales, down 1.5 percentage points from 2001. Gross margins were positively impacted by improved plant efficiencies, lower raw material costs and 3Ms global sourcing initiative. In 2001, slowing worldwide market demand and negative currency impacts reduced gross margins. Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2002 were 22.8 percent of net sales, down 2.3 percentage points from 2001. Excluding non recurring charges, SG&A expenses were 22.3 percent(#) of net sales, a decrease of 1.0 percentage point from 2001. Excluding non recurring items, SG&A spending totaled $3.643 billion(#) in 2002, a decrease of 2.5 percent from 2001. This improvement in SG&A costs was the result of implementing Six Sigma, indirect cost control programs (controlling those expenses not directly associated with 3M products and services) and employment reductions under the restructuring plan approved in June 2001. SG&A also benefited by $67 million due to the cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived asset amortization effective January 1, 2002. Excluding non recurring charges in 2001, SG&A was 23.3 percent(#) of sales, which was a decrease of three tenths of one percentage point from 24 the prior year. This decrease in 2001 spending was due to cost savings generated from 3Ms indirect cost initiative and lower employment levels. Operating income: Operating income is used by 3M as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income excludes interest expense, interest income, the provision for income taxes and minority interest. Operating income in 2002 was 18.7 percent of net sales, compared with 14.2 percent in 2001. Excluding non recurring charges, operating income in 2002 was 19.9 percent(#) of net sales, compared with 17.3 percent(#) in 2001. Although the company faced continued economic weakness, operating income excluding non recurring items grew by $471 million, or 17.0 percent, from 2001. The cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived asset amortization benefited operating income by $67 million, while currency impacts reduced operating income by an estimated $60 million. Excluding non recurring items, 2001 operating income totaled $2.777 billion(#), or 17.3 percent(#) of sales, compared to 18.4 percent(#) of sales in 2000. This decrease was due to slowing worldwide market demand, and negative currency effects. Excluding non recurring items, operating income margins in 2002 were 15.9 percent(#) in the United States and 23.2 percent(#) internationally. Interest expense and income: Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) in 2002 was $41 million, which was $46 million lower than the prior year. Interest expense was $80 million in 2002, $124 million in 2001, and $111 in 2000. Declining rates on floating rate debt drove the reduction in expense in 2002. The increase in 2001 reflected higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest income was $39 million in 2002, $37 million in 2001 and $27 million in 2000. The increase in both 2002 and 2001 interest income primarily related to larger average cash balances. Provision for income taxes: The worldwide effective income tax rate for 2002 was 32.1 percent, the same as 2001. Excluding non recurring items, the worldwide effective income tax rate in 2002 was 32.5 percent(#), down from 32.9 percent(#) the prior year. Excluding non recurring items, the tax rate decrease compared to total year 2001 was primarily due to a lower average effective tax rate for international operations. The effective tax rate in 2000 was 34.5 percent. The effective tax rate decrease in 2001 when compared to 2000 related to the impact of recurring tax credits on lower profit levels. Minority interest: Minority interest expense was $65 million in 2002, $54 million in 2001 and $92 million in 2000. Excluding non recurring items, minority interest was $83 million(#) in 2002 and $62 million(#) in 2001. Minority interest represents the elimination of the non 3M ownership interests, primarily in Sumitomo 3M Limited and 3M Inter Unitek GmbH (in 2002 and 2001 only). The increase in 2002 related primarily to higher profits in Sumitomo 3M and 3M Inter Unitek GmbH. The decrease in 2001 was driven by lower profits in Sumitomo 3M. In 2003, 3M expects lower minority interest expense. This reduction is expected due to the purchase of the minority interest shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH in December 2002 and the purchase of an additional 25 percent ownership interest in Sumitomo 3M in early 2003. Refer to Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these acquisitions. Net income: Net income totaled $1.974 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, compared with $1.430 billion, or $3.58 per diluted share, in 2001, and $1.782 billion, or $4.45 per diluted share, in 2000. Non recurring charges negatively impacted net income by $108 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in 2002, $312 million, or 78 cents per diluted share, in 2001, and $90 million, or 23 cents per diluted share, in 2000. The cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived asset amortization effective January 1, 2002, increased earnings per diluted share by 12 cents in 2002. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, 3M estimates that currency effects reduced net income by $35 million (8 cents per diluted share), $94 million (24 cents per diluted share) and $55 million (14 cents per diluted share), respectively. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce 25 foreign currency exchange rate risks. In 2002, derivative and other transactions gains and losses decreased net income by $25 million. Derivative and other transactions gains and losses increased net income by $29 million in 2001 and increased net income by $21 million in 2000. Employment: At December 31, 2002, employment totaled 68,774 people, a decrease of 2,895 people from year end 2001. Since March 31, 2001, employment has declined by approximately 8,900 people, with 6,900 of the decline related to the restructuring plan, and 3,500 of the decline due to the integration of acquisitions and attrition. These decreases were partially offset by the Corning Precision Lens, Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 that added about 1,500 people. Sales per employee in local currencies increased about 9 percent in 2002, decreased about 3 percent in 2001, and increased about 7 percent in 2000. Operating initiatives: The company will continue to press ahead with its five corporate initiatives (Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, Indirect Cost Reduction and eProductivity) aimed at accelerating long term top line growth, improving cash efficiency and lowering its total cost structure. Six Sigma focuses on higher growth, lower costs and greater cash flow. Global Sourcing Effectiveness generates savings through buying smarter, managing supply agreements, geographic broadening and e applications. 3M Acceleration reallocates research and development resources to larger, more global projects. Indirect Cost Reduction focuses on reducing costs not directly associated with products or services. In eProductivity, 3M believes it has a significant digitization opportunity. The company estimates that these initiatives provided a combined benefit on a pre tax basis of more than $500 million in 2002. In 2003, the company estimates these initiatives could contribute on a pre tax basis an additional $300 million compared to 2002. There can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. Numerous factors may create offsets to these savings, such as the potential for continued weakness in sales volumes, normal increases in compensation and benefits, and other inflationary pressures. Restructuring charges: During the first half of 2001, the company developed and announced a restructuring plan that consolidates certain operations and streamlines the organization to increase speed and productivity. In June 2001, the company completed the identification of the significant actions to be taken and obtained approvals from the appropriate level of management. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company obtained approvals for certain additional actions. These actions were substantially completed by June 30, 2002. In the first six months of 2002, 3M incurred $202 million of pre tax expenses relating to the restructuring plan. The 2002 charges relate to employee severance and benefits ($111 million), accelerated depreciation ($47 million) and other ($44 million). During 2001, 3M incurred $569 million of pre tax expenses principally related to the restructuring plan. The 2001 charges relate to employee severance and benefits ($472 million), accelerated depreciation ($80 million) and other ($17 million). The company has not discontinued any major product lines as a result of this restructuring. In connection with its restructuring plan, the company eliminated a total of about 6,900 positions. These positions represent a wide range of functions throughout the company. Of the 6,900 employment reduction for the total plan, about 45 percent occurred in the United States, 30 percent in Europe, and the balance in other international areas. All business segments were impacted directly and also indirectly through reduced allocations of corporate staff service costs. The impact of the total restructuring, including the allocated portion of restructured staff services, is estimated by segment as follows: Industrial, 35 percent; Electro and Communications, 20 percent; Transportation, Graphics and Safety, 20 percent; Health Care, 10 percent; Consumer and Office, 10 percent; and Specialty Material, 5 percent. These estimates are provided only as a frame of reference as to the order of magnitude by segment. In order to enhance segment comparability and reflect managements focus on ongoing operations, these restructuring costs have not been recorded in the individual business segments. 26 Related to this restructuring plan, the company estimates it saved on a pre tax basis $300 million in 2002, in addition to the $80 million saved in 2001. The company estimates an additional $120 million of incremental savings on a pre tax basis in 2003. The majority of the savings will be reduced employee costs. The 2002 savings were spread across cost of sales, SG&A, and research, development and related expenses. The 2001 savings were most prominent in SG&A, with cost of sales benefits occurring in late 2001. Numerous factors may create offsets to these savings, such as the potential for continued weakness in sales volumes, normal increases in compensation and benefits, and other inflationary pressures. Of the companys remaining current liability at December 31, 2002, $30 million is classified in current liabilities (payroll) and $18 million is classified in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company classified as long term liabilities $43 million of its 2002 charges and $124 million of its 2001 charges. Special termination pension and medical benefits, aggregating $43 million in 2002 and $62 million in 2001, were offered to eligible employees. These benefits will generally be paid over their life expectancies. In addition, of the $62 million in separation pay that was deferred in 2001, $47 million was reclassified to current in 2002. The company also recorded $3 million of non cash stock option expense ($8 million in 2001) due to the reclassification of certain employees age 50 and older to retiree status, resulting in a modification of their original stock option awards for accounting purposes. The current liabilities and a portion of the non current liabilities will be funded through cash provided by operations, while funding for certain long term special termination pension and medical liabilities will be provided through established pension and postretirement trust funds. The majority of the long term portion of the liability, primarily special termination pension and medical liabilities, is reflected as a component of 3Ms pension and medical trust plans as a portion of the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO). It is estimated that 3Ms benefit plans reflect approximately $100 million of restructuring related long term liabilities that have not yet been paid out as of December 31, 2002. Selected information related to these charges follows.

Goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually. The companys formal annual review of all goodwill in 2002 indicated that no impairment existed. Indefinite lived intangible asset impairments were not material. Additional information regarding accounting pronouncements of the FASB, including SFAS No. 142, is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures, including discussion of non recurring items, are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non recurring items in 2001 (that were not recorded in Corporate and Unallocated) included acquisition related costs totaling $23 million ($10 million recorded in Health Care; $7 million in Transportation, Graphics and Safety; and $6 million in Electro and Communications). The company adopted EITF No. 00 25 effective January 1, 2002. This adoption resulted in a reclassification of approximately $25 million of advertising expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales for 2000 and 2001, with no impact on operating income. This reclassification resulted in a reduction in both advertising expense and net sales for these years. These reclassifications were reflected in the companys Consumer and Office segment. Effective July 1, 2002, the company also reclassified net sales and operating income for the realignment of certain businesses from the Health Care segment to the Consumer and Office segment. This alignment will best utilize 3Ms consumer and key account expertise to strengthen the position of certain brands in the marketplace. These businesses had net sales of $118 million and operating income of $7 million for total year 2001. This realignment had no impact on total company net sales or operating income. Transportation, Graphics and Safety Markets (23 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides products for transportation safety, commercial graphics, respiratory protection, optical display, automotive and personal safety. Sales in 2002 totaled $3.840 billion, an increase of 8.9 percent from 2001. Sales volumes were up 9.5 percent and pricing decreased six tenths of a percent. Operating income increased to $915 million, up nearly 32 percent on a reported basis (up about 30 percent excluding non recurring items in 2001). The growth in both sales and operating income were driven primarily by optical film products. In addition, the occupational health and automotive products also contributed to the sales growth and operating income improvement. In December 2002, 3M completed the acquisition of Corning Precision Lens, Inc., a manufacturer of lens systems for projection televisions. This acquisition will add to the optical product offerings and will operate under the name 3M Precision Optics, Inc. This business had 2002 net sales of approximately $270 million, but since this business was not acquired by 3M until December 2002, there was minimal impact on 2002 sales and operating income of the Transportation, Graphics and Safety Markets. Health Care Markets (22 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides innovative products that improve peoples health and well being, including dental, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and health information systems. Sales grew to $3.560 billion, an increase of $259 million, or 7.9 percent, from 2001. Sales volumes were up 6.9 percent and pricing increased eight tenths of one percent. Volume and price both were negatively impacted by generic competition for 3Ms branded Tambocor brand pharmaceutical product. Translation had a positive two tenths of a percent impact on Health Care Market sales in 2002. Operating income increased to $900 million, up 19.5 percent on a reported basis (up about 18 percent excluding non recurring items in 2001). 3Ms medical supplies, dental and pharmaceutical products led the sales and operating income growth. In December 2002, 3M acquired the remaining 43 percent outstanding shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH (parent company of 3M ESPE Dental AG). Since these results have been fully consolidated since 2001 (when 3M acquired 57 percent of this business), this additional acquisition of the remaining 28 shares had no impact on 2002 sales or operating income of the Health Care Markets segment. In the pharmaceutical business, an agreement was reached with Eli Lilly and Company in September of 2001 to collaborate on resiquimod, an investigational compound for the treatment of genital herpes. 3M received $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from Lilly in consideration for research and development efforts. Revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the service period. 3M recognized $43 million of revenue relating to this agreement in 2002 and $7 million of revenue in 2001. On February 24, 2003, 3M jointly announced with Lilly suspension of clinical trials of resiquimod because preliminary data from recently completed Phase III trials suggested the dosing of resiquimod used in the studies would not achieve adequate efficacy. The data did not indicate any safety concerns with the drug. 3M and Lilly are working to determine whether to conduct additional clinical trials on resiquimod for genital herpes. Meanwhile, the broader family of Immune Response Modifiers (IRMs) continues to progress. On March 3, 2003, 3M announced positive clinical results in pivotal Phase III studies of Aldara brand (imiquimod) Cream 5%, an immune response modifier (IRM), for multiple actinic keratoses (AK) and superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC). These potentially serious skin conditions are a direct result of cumulative sun exposure. With these Phase III results on Aldara, 3M Pharmaceuticals is on schedule for mid year 2003 FDA submissions of the supplemental new drug applications. Industrial Markets (20 percent of consolidated sales): This market provides tapes, coated and nonwoven abrasives, and specialty adhesives. Sales totaled $3.225 billion, an increase of eight tenths of one percent. Volume decreased 0.3 percent, reflecting continuing weakness in most manufacturing sectors of the economy. Pricing increased 1.5 percent in 2002 and translation negatively impacted sales by four tenths of one percent. Operating income increased to $563 million, an increase of about 8.5 percent, due to effective cost control and increased efficiencies. Automotive aftermarket, engineered adhesives, and industrial tape products all showed good sales growth and operating income improvement. Coated abrasives and 3Ms packaging systems products were hardest hit by the weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy. During the third quarter of 2002, 3M finalized the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Emtech Emulsion Technologies, Inc. and Emtech Manufacturing Corporation. Acquisitions did not have a significant impact on 2002 sales for this segment (less than 1 percent), and did not materially impact operating income. Consumer and Office Markets (17 percent of consolidated sales): The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer, office, education, foodservice and other important markets. Sales in 2002 decreased nine tenths of one percent to $2.792 billion. Volumes decreased 1.6 percent in 2002. The decrease in volume reflected continued office worker lay offs and inventory contraction in the retail channel affecting office supplies. Increased pricing had a positive two tenths of one percent impact, and translation increased sales by five tenths of one percent. Operating income increased to $514 million, up more than 13 percent for the year. Construction and home improvement products posted strong sales growth and operating income improvement for the year. 3Ms home care and office supply products also posted strong operating income improvement. Six Sigma and costs savings from other 3M initiatives drove the operating income improvement. Electro and Communications Markets (12 percent of consolidated sales): This segment supplies connecting, splicing, insulating and protective products for the electronics, communications and electrical industries. Sales in 2002 totaled $1.914 billion, down 11.9 percent from the prior year. Volumes were down 11.3 percent in 2002. This decrease in volumes reflected overall softness in the telecom markets. Pricing decreased sales by eight tenths of one percent, and translation increased sales by two tenths of one percent. Operating income increased to $265 million, up about 21.5 percent on a reported basis (up about 18 percent excluding non recurring items in 2001). Operating income growth was broad based, except for weakness in the Telecom markets. 29 Specialty Material Markets (6 percent of consolidated sales): This segment provides high value materials for demanding applications in chemical processing, automotive, electronics, telecommunications and other industries. Sales totaled $953 million in 2002, a decrease of 6.8 percent from 2001, primarily due to the phase out of perfluorooctanyl chemistry used to produce repellents and surfactant products. In addition, weaker sales in electronics end markets contributed to the decrease in sales. Volume decreased 7.7 percent in 2002. Pricing changes did not impact 2002 sales, and translation increased sales by nine tenths of one percent. Products in 3Ms industrial minerals and Dyneon operations both experienced improvements in sales growth and operating income for 2002. Operating income totaled $136 million, down nearly 4 percent. The decrease in operating income was mainly the result of the previously mentioned phase out of perfluorooctanyl chemistry. This phase out was announced in May 2000, and substantially implemented in that year; additional steps were taken in 2001 and 2002. For related developments, refer to the "Environmental Matters" section in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Information related to 3Ms business segments is presented in the table that follows.

Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. **Segment assets primarily include accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment net; goodwill and intangible assets; and other miscellaneous assets. The increase in 2002 assets for Transportation, Graphics and Safety primarily related to the Corning Precision Lens, Inc. acquisition in December 2002. Assets included in Corporate and Unallocated principally are cash and cash equivalents; insurance receivables; deferred income taxes; certain investments and other assets; and certain unallocated property, plant and equipment. 30 NEW BUSINESS SEGMENTS REPORTING EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003: In September 2002, 3M announced it would strategically realign its organization for faster growth and a closer focus on markets and customers. This realignment resulted in seven new reportable business segments compared to the current structure of six reportable business segments. These structural changes were driven by 3Ms strategic planning process and represent an important step toward access to its larger and faster growing markets. Executive vice president appointments were effective October 1, 2002, but a three month transition period was provided to realign the existing organization to the new structure. Internal management reporting for the new reportable business segments commenced January 1, 2003. The new reportable segments are Health Care; Industrial; Consumer and Office; Display and Graphics; Electro and Communications; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Transportation. The Health Care, and Electro and Communications segments remained largely intact. Specialty Materials was realigned to other segments. A description of each new reportable business segment follows. The Health Care segment serves markets worldwide including medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, dental, health information systems and other markets. Products provided to these markets include medical and pharmaceutical products, drug delivery systems, dental products, health information systems, and personal care and related products. The Industrial segment serves a broad range of industrial markets from aerospace and plastics to metalworking and packaging. Products include abrasives, engineered adhesives, industrial tape, packaging systems, superabrasives and microfinishing systems, surface conditioning products, Dyneon brand materials, performance materials, specialty materials, and filtration products. The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer, office, education, foodservice and other important markets. Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products, protective material products, home care, and visual systems products. The Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, touch screen, commercial graphics, traffic control materials and other major markets. This segment includes products related to traffic control materials, optical systems, commercial graphics and specialty film and media products. The Electro and Communications segment serves the electronic and telecommunications markets with products that speed the delivery of information and ideas, while also reducing costs. This segment also serves the electrical power market. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, microinterconnect systems, telecommunication products and electrical products. The Safety, Security and Protection Services segment strives to increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems around the world. This includes products related to occupational health and safety, commercial care, safety and security, industrial mineral, food services trade, consumer safety and light management, and corrosion protection products. The Transportation segment serves automotive manufacturers, automotive body shops, the aerospace and marine industries, and other segments of the transportation market worldwide. This segment includes products for the automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM market, aerospace and aircraft maintenance, marine trades, and commercial vehicles. Proforma results for this new organizational structure effective January 1, 2003 follow. The company believes this information will assist shareholders in their understanding of the company and how it will operate going forward. 31 Supplemental Proforma Business Segment Information Based on Segment Structure Effective January 1, 2003 Depr.

Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. **Segment assets primarily include accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment net; goodwill and intangible assets; and other miscellaneous assets. The increase in 2002 assets for Display and Graphics primarily related to the Corning Precision Lens, Inc. acquisition in December 2002. Assets included in Corporate and Unallocated principally are cash and cash equivalents; insurance receivables; deferred income taxes; certain investments and other assets; and certain unallocated property, plant and equipment. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income and other financial information shown. The allocations resulting from the shared utilization of assets are not necessarily indicative of the underlying activity for segment assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures. Operating income in 2002 included non recurring charges of $202 million related to the restructuring plan (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated). Depreciation and amortization of $954 million included accelerated depreciation (shortened lives) of $47 million related to the restructuring (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated). Operating income in 2001 included non recurring charges of $504 million. Non recurring charges, principally related to the companys restructuring plan, 32 totaled $569 million (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated). Acquisition related costs totaled $23 million ($10 million recorded in Health Care; $7 million in Display and Graphics; and $6 million in Electro and Communications). Additional items recorded in Corporate and Unallocated included a reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual of $73 million, and a gain of $15 million related to the net impact of the sale and write down of available for sale equity securities. Depreciation and amortization of $1.089 billion included accelerated depreciation (shortened lives) of $80 million related to the restructuring (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated). Operating income in 2000 included non recurring net losses of $23 million. Non recurring costs included $168 million related to the companys phase out of perfluorooctanyl based chemistry products (recorded in Corporate and Unallocated). This $168 million included $56 million of accelerated depreciation (included in Corporate and Unallocated depreciation and amortization), $48 million of impairment losses, and severance and other costs. Other non recurring costs included a $20 million write down of corporate and unallocated assets, and $20 million of other non recurring expenses ($13 million related to acquisitions in the Electro and Communications segment). Non recurring operating income gains in 2000 of $135 million were largely related to corporate and unallocated asset dispositions, principally the sale of available for sale equity securities. Operating income in 2000 also included a $50 million gain from the termination of a product distribution agreement in the Health Care segment. PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information, including discussion of non recurring items, related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of the products or components sold by 3Ms international countries to third parties are exported back to the United States and other parts of the world. Thus, the net sales growth by geography may not be indicative of end user consumption in the local country. Non recurring pre tax losses of $202 million in 2002 and $504 million in 2001, primarily related to the restructuring, are included in Eliminations and Other (not assigned to a specific geographic area). United States (45 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in the United States totaled $7.426 billion, down 1.3 percent from 2001. U.S. core volume declined 1.6 percent. Operating income was up 14.8 percent. Weak overall sales in Electro and Communications, Specialty Material and Industrial segments were partially offset by good growth in the Health Care and Consumer and Office segments. Europe and Middle East (25 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in Europe and the Middle East totaled $4.035 billion, up 1.9 percent from 2001. Volume decreased 3.5 percent and selling prices were up two tenths of one percent. Currency translation increased sales by 5.2 percent. The significant downturn in the telecom industry negatively impacted Europes sales. However, higher growth in the Health Care segment provided some offset to the telecom impact. Despite the decrease in volumes, 2002 operating income increased by 20 percent. Operating income was 17.0 percent of sales, compared with 14.4 percent of sales in 2001. Asia Pacific (21 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in Asia Pacific totaled $3.431 billion, up 12.8 percent from 2001. Volume in the Asia Pacific area increased 14.4 percent, driven by the Transportation, Graphics and Safety, Health Care and Industrial segments. Selling prices decreased 1.7 percent, while currency translation increased sales by one tenth of one percent. Operating income was 29.4 percent of sales, up from 26.5 percent in 2001. In Japan, home of 3Ms largest international company, volume increased 7.5 percent. Volume in the remainder of the Asia Pacific region increased about 21 percent. Latin America, Canada and Africa (9 percent of consolidated sales): Sales in Latin America, Canada and Africa combined totaled $1.392 billion, down 6.8 percent from 2001. In Latin America, local currency sales increased 5.3 percent. Currency reduced Latin America sales by 16.4 percent. Economic and political instability negatively impacted sales in many parts of Latin America during 2002. In Canada, volume increased 4.6 percent. Selling prices increased nine tenths of one percent, while translation decreased 1.1 percent. Operating income for Latin America, Canada and Africa was 28.0 percent of sales, up from 24.1 percent in 2001. 33 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The companys financial condition and liquidity at December 31, 2002, remains strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $1.602 billion at December 31, 2002, decreasing $185 million from year end 2001. The accounts receivable turnover index (defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending net accounts receivable) totaled 6.55 at December 31, 2002, an improvement from 6.22 at year end 2001. Receivables increased $45 million compared with year end 2001, with currency translation increasing the accounts receivable balance by $147 million (due to the weaker U.S. dollar). The inventory turnover index (defined as quarterly factory cost excluding non recurring amounts multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory) was 4.17 at December 31, 2002, an improvement from 3.76 at year end 2001. Inventories declined $160 million compared with year end 2001, despite currency translation increasing the inventory balance by $88 million compared with December 31, 2001. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.992 billion in 2002, $3.078 billion in 2001 and $2.326 billion in 2000. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In 2002, 3M funded certain employee pension plans by nearly $1.1 billion, primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 (discussed in more detail later), resulting in a decrease of operating cash flows. Cash flow benefits resulted from increased profitability, working capital improvements and tax timing differences. In 2001, working capital reductions drove the increase. As discussed in the "Performance by Business Segment" section of this report, 3M received $100 million from Eli Lilly and Company in the fourth quarter of 2001 relating to a pharmaceutical agreement. In 2002, 3M made $306 million of payments under the restructuring plan, compared with $159 million in 2001. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, 3Ms insurance recoveries, net of claims paid, related to the breast implant litigation totaled $51 million, $101 million and $49 million, respectively. Most of the companys implant liabilities have been paid; accordingly, receipt of related insurance recoveries will increase future cash flows. For a more detailed discussion, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Globally, 3Ms pension plan assets have declined due to recent equity market weakness while pension liabilities and benefit payments have continued to grow. 3Ms pension plan assets were below 3Ms accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at its most recent plan measurement dates for certain plans. Accounting rules require that, if ABO exceeds the fair value of pension plan assets, the employer must recognize a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded ABO. In the fourth quarter of 2002, 3M recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment that impacted other comprehensive income by $1.056 billion (net of tax). Other comprehensive income captures certain items excluded from net income, such as changes in cumulative translation, unrealized gains or losses related to available for sale equity securities, as well as additional minimum pension liabilities not yet recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as part of net pension cost. Other balance sheet accounts impacted by this included deferred tax assets (increase of $666 million), unfunded pension assets (decrease of $1.185 billion), pension and other liabilities (increase of $641 million), and an intangible asset related to unrecognized prior service costs (increase of $104 million). In the third quarter of 2002, the companys U.S. pension contribution of $789 million resulted in an increase in prepaid pension assets and an increase of approximately $300 million in deferred income tax liabilities. Future pension contributions will depend on market conditions. In looking at a number of different scenarios, 3M is confident its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.927 billion in 2002, compared with $1.050 billion in 2001 and $1.373 billion in 2000. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $763 million in 2002, $980 million in 2001, and $1.115 billion in 2000. These investments are helping to meet product demand and increase manufacturing efficiency. 3M expects to spend approximately $900 million in 2003 on purchases of 34 property, plant and equipment. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment totaled $82 million, down from approximately $100 million in both 2001 and 2000. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses totaled $1.258 billion in 2002, $218 million in 2001 and $472 million in 2000. 3M completed two significant transactions in 2002. First, 3M purchased Corning Precision Lens, Inc. for approximately $850 million, or approximately $680 million after considering the net present value of the joint election tax benefit under Section 338(h)(10), which allows goodwill to be fully deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years. Second, 3M purchased the 43 percent minority shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH for approximately $304 million. The company also entered into seven other business combinations in 2002 for a total of $104 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $35 million of 3M common stock. Refer to Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on business combinations. There were three significant business combinations in 2001. 3M acquired MicroTouch Systems Inc., a touch screen manufacturer, for $158 million in cash, net of cash acquired. 3M also acquired Robinson Nugent, Inc., a telecommunications supplier, in exchange for 1,124,135 shares of 3M common stock. The company also combined its German dental business (3M Inter Unitek GmbH, an existing 3M subsidiary) with ESPE Dental AG, a dental products manufacturer. 3M Inter Unitek GmbH acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of ESPE Dental AG in exchange for 43 percent ownership in 3M Inter Unitek GmbH and $25 million, net of cash acquired (see previous discussion concerning the purchase of the remaining 3M Inter Unitek GmbH minority shares in 2002). Acquisition activity in 2001 also included the purchase, for less than $50 million, of five smaller companies that had combined annual net sales of less than $50 million in total. Acquisitions in 2000 totaled $472 million in cash (net of cash acquired), plus 128,994 shares of 3M common stock. This included the purchase of 91 percent (subsequently increased to 99 percent) of Quante AG (a telecommunications supplier); the purchase of the multi layer integrated circuit packaging line of W.L. Gore and Associates; and the acquisition of seven smaller businesses. These seven smaller businesses had a combined purchase price of less than $125 million and combined annual net sales of less than $75 million. The company is actively considering additional acquisitions. In January 2003, 3M entered into two additional business combinations, neither of which impacted 2002 operating results or the balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. 3M purchased an additional 25 percent share of Sumitomo 3M Limited, a Japanese company, from NEC Corporation for approximately $375 million. Prior to this purchase, 3M controlled and owned 50 percent of Sumitomo 3M Limited and fully consolidated both Sumitomo 3M Limiteds balance sheet and results of operations, with a provision for the minority interest that did not have participating rights. In a smaller acquisition, 3M acquired 100 percent of the common shares of Solvay Fluoropolymers, which has manufacturing facilities located in Decatur, Alabama. Although purchase price allocations have not been finalized, 3M expects no in process research and development charges resulting from these acquisitions. Purchases of investments totaled $7 million in 2002 and $12 million in both 2001 and 2000. These purchases include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. Total debt at December 31, 2002, was $3.377 billion, up from $2.893 billion at year end 2001. Total debt was 36 percent of total capital, compared with 32 percent at year end 2001. The company financed the fourth quarter 2002 Corning Precision Lens, Inc. acquisition through a combination of operating cash flows and other financing. Other fourth quarter 2002 events that impacted the debt to capital ratio included the purchase by 3M of the remaining 43 percent minority interest in 3M Inter Unitek GmbH for cash of $304 million, and the equity reduction from the minimum pension liability adjustment effect on other comprehensive income of approximately $1.1 billion. For these reasons, 3Ms debt to capital for year end 2002 totaled 36 percent and may stay close to that level for the next quarter or two. The debt to capital ratio is expected to return to the 30 to 35 percent range shortly thereafter. 35 In 2002, the cash flow decrease in net short term debt of $204 million includes the portion of short term debt with original maturities of three months or less. The repayment of debt of $497 million primarily related to the repayment of commercial paper having original maturities greater than three months. The proceeds from debt of $1.146 billion included $550 million related to issuance of convertible debt in 2002 (discussed in more detail later), $400 million related to a 2002 debt issuance under the medium term notes program, and the balance was largely comprised of commercial paper having original maturities greater than three months. In 2001, both repayment and proceeds from debt amounts include large amounts related to commercial paper having original maturities greater than three months. On November 15, 2002, 3M sold $639 Million in aggregate face amount of 30 year zero coupon senior notes (the "Convertible Notes") that are convertible into shares of 3M common stock. The gross proceeds from the offering, to be used for general corporate purposes, were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs). The terms of the Convertible Notes include a yield to maturity of .50 percent and an initial conversion premium of 40 percent over the $130.00 closing price of 3M common stock on November 14, 2002. If certain conditions for conversion (relating to the closing common stock prices of 3M exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods) are met, holders may convert each of the 30 year zero coupon senior notes into 4.7301 shares of 3M common stock in any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2003. If the conditions for conversion are met, and 3M elects not to settle in cash, the 30 year zero coupon senior notes will be convertible in the aggregate into approximately 3.0 million shares of 3M common stock. 3M may redeem the 30 year zero coupon senior notes at any time in whole or in part, after five years at the greater of the accreted conversion price or the current market price. Holders of the 30 year zero coupon senior notes have the option to require 3M to purchase their notes at accreted value in years three, five, 10, 15, 20 and 25. 3M may choose to pay the redemption purchase price in cash and or common stock. Debt issuance costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period beginning in November 2002. There was no impact on 3Ms 2002 diluted earnings per share, as the conversion rights commence after March 31, 2003. On February 14, 2003, 3M registered these Convertible Notes in a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In December 2000, the company issued approximately $350 million of debt securities, remarketable annually (with a final maturity date of December 2010), which is classified as short term debt. In October 2000, the company filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the potential offering of debt securities of up to $1.5 billion. After the shelf registration became effective, the company, in May 2001, established under the shelf a medium term notes program through which up to $1.4 billion of medium term notes may be offered. 3M plans to use the net proceeds from future issuances of debt securities under these registrations for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt or the financing of possible acquisitions. As of December 31, 2002, $950 million of medium term notes had been issued under the medium term note program and another $56 million of debt securities had been issued directly from the shelf, aggregating $1.006 billion of outstanding debt securities issued under the shelf. The companys liquidity position remains strong. Primary short term liquidity needs are provided through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. At year end 2002, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $494 million and averaged approximately $455 million during 2002. Medium term note shelf borrowing capacity totaled $450 million at year end 2002. Credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a $565 million, 364 day credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks. The facility provides up to $65 million in letters of credit ($64 million of which was outstanding at December 31, 2002). Committed credit facilities of $91 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations. The company also has uncommitted lines of credit totaling $250 36 million. The company expects to renew the committed lines of credit facilities in 2003. The company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations, if necessary. At year end 2002, certain debt agreements ($565 million of short term lines of credit, $350 million of dealer remarketable securities, and the $271 million of ESOP debt) had ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. The company currently has an AA/Aa1 rating. A summary of the companys significant contractual obligations follows. Certain unconditional purchase obligations relate to take or pay contracts with terms in excess of one year, in which 3M has typically guaranteed payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for a majority of these unconditional purchase obligations. Other contractual obligations are not significant. The ESOP debt guarantee is recorded as a component of long term debt. Contractual Obligations Payments due by year After (Millions) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2007 Long term debt (including current portion) $2,493 $353 $385 $437 $ 39 $ 40 $1,239 Operating leases 283 71 52 34 25 19 82 Capital leases 111 4 4 4 4 4 91 Unconditional purchase obligations 153 66 46 27 4 3 7 Total contractual cash obligations $3,040 $494 $487 $502 $ 72 $ 66 $1,419 3Ms guarantees of loans with third parties, indemnification contracts, and other guarantees are estimated at approximately $25 million. 3Ms accrued product warranty liability is also estimated at approximately $25 million. 3M does not consider these amounts to be significant. Repurchases of 3M common stock totaled $942 million in 2002, compared with $1.322 billion in 2001 and $814 million in 2000. Repurchases were made to support the companys management stock option plan, its general employees stock purchase plan, and for other corporate purposes. In November 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the companys common stock. This share repurchase authorization is effective from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. In 2002, the company purchased approximately 7.9 million shares for $942 million. The reduction in annual weighted average diluted shares outstanding (including the effects of repurchases, issuances and dilution) resulted in a benefit of 6 cents per diluted share in 2002 and 8 cents per diluted share in 2000. There was no impact in 2001. Cash dividends paid to stockholders in 2002 totaled $968 million, or $2.48 per share. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2003, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock to 66 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.64 per share. This marks the 45th consecutive year of dividend increases. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. 37 The company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection swaps and forward physical contracts. A variance/co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2002. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. Based on this analysis of the companys interest rate risks, possible changes in interest rates would not adversely impact after tax earnings by a material amount ($7 million at December 31, 2002, and $6 million at December 31, 2001). Based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks, possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by $40 million ($57 million at December 31, 2001). In 2002, the actual currency impact did not exceed the value at risk after tax amount of $40 million. This model analyzed more than 20 different currencies, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, which will move costs outside the United States. This will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations. In 2001, the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings. However, this hedging program will not make 3M immune to currency impacts. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess commodity risks. The technique used evaluates the effect that changes in the market value of commodities will have on the companys commodity derivative instruments. At year end 2002 and 2001, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying commodity price, was not material ($1 million after tax at December 31, 2002, and $4 million after tax at December 31, 2001). The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to partially hedge about one percent of this exposure. The global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $30 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to partially hedge about 15 percent of this energy exposure. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. In the context of Item 7A, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Debt, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The company does not have leveraged derivative positions. 38
