Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. 3M manages its operations in seven operating business segments: Health Care; Industrial; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Electro and Communications; and Transportation. Despite continued challenging global economic conditions in 2003, particularly in the United States and Europe, 3M made significant progress toward its objective of driving long term, sustainable improvements in sales, profitability and cash flow. In 2003, 3M reported record net sales of $18.232 billion and record net income of $2.403 billion, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared with net sales of $16.332 billion and net income of $1.974 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in 2002. The combination of an 11.6% increase in net sales, including core volume sales growth of 4.7%, and declining operating expenses as a percent of sales, resulted in a 20.4% operating income profit margin. The following table summarizes sales and operating income results in millions by business segment for the years ended December 31. 2003 2002 2003 vs. 2002% change Net Sales % of Total Oper.Income Net Sales % of Total Oper.

Sales were also helped by broad based growth in most of the Health Care segment and growth related to construction and home improvement/home care in the Consumer and Office segment. Electro and Communications was the only segment to report a decrease in sales revenues as the telecommunications industry remained weak in 2003. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective segments. Asia Pacific local currency sales increased 19.8%, with the strongest growth in China and Korea. All seven business segments contributed to this increase. U.S. sales revenue improved 2.1%, with growth in five of the seven segments, but overall growth was held back by the continued softness in the Industrial and Electro and Communications segments. Foreign currency translation positively impacted European sales by 15.3% and 16 Asia Pacific sales by 6.5%, as the U.S. dollar weakened against these currencies. Refer to the Performance by Geographic Area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective regions. Operating income in 2003 increased by 21.9% versus 2002, as six of seven business segments posted increases. The combination of solid sales growth, positive benefits from 3Ms corporate initiatives and savings from the last piece of the 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program drove the operating income increase. These initiatives Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, eProductivity and Indirect Cost Control contributed over $400 million in aggregate operating income benefits in 2003. Currency impacts, related primarily to the weaker U.S. dollar, boosted 2003 operating income by an estimated $111 million, although the Company absorbed a similar amount of expenses via a series of productivity actions. 3M generated $3.773 billion of operating cash flows in 2003, a $781 million increase over 2002, and ended the year with $1.836 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Cash flow in 2003 was driven by improved net income, working capital improvements and tax timing differences. In 2003, the Company utilized $1.719 billion of cash to repurchase 3M common stock and pay dividends, and contributed $749 million to its pension plans. 3Ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) as of December 31, 2003, was approximately 27%. 3M has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service. In 2004, 3M will continue to focus on improving its top line growth rate, with primary emphasis on driving higher organic, or core, growth. 3M is looking for broader based product performance to contribute to its growth, in addition to expected continued growth in optical film products, and will also continue to assess potential acquisitions. Stronger core growth will require both faster growth of existing products/services and successful introduction of new products, including sales of 3Ms immune response modifier pharmaceutical to treat two new indications (superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis) once anticipated regulatory approval has been obtained. The Company also is focused on its corporate initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. 3Ms corporate initiatives are expected to contribute an additional $400 million to operating income in 2004. Increased pension expense is expected to reduce operating income by approximately $165 million. As in 2003 and 2002, the Company will consider the need for additional contributions to its pension plans. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact results, although the Company expects to hedge about half of this impact. 3M will also continue, as it has for many years, to incur expenses (insured and uninsured) in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies. By improving organic sales volume growth, driving its costs and productivity initiatives, and making appropriate disciplined acquisitions, 3M expects to achieve solid growth in sales and income for 2004. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward looking statements discussion later in Item 7 for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).

The stock split was in the form of a stock dividend of one additional share for each share owned by stockholders of record and each share held in treasury as of the close of business on September 22, 2003, and was distributed on September 29, 2003. All share and per share information has been adjusted in the accompanying financial statements and related notes to reflect this split. Special Items: Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding the Companys ongoing operating results. Special items are not measures recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. In 2003, 3M recorded pre tax charges of $93 million ($58 million after tax, or 7 cents per diluted share) related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3M in 1997 by LePages Inc. The pre tax charge of $93 million has been classified as Other expense within operating income. For more detail, refer to the discussion of Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this document. In 2002, special items reduced operating income by $202 million and net income by $108 million, or 13 cents per diluted share. These charges principally related to employee severance and benefit costs, accelerated depreciation charges, and other associated exit costs under the Companys restructuring plan announced in June 2001. These charges are included in cost of sales ($121 million); selling, general and administrative expenses ($77 million); and research, development and related expenses ($4 million). For more detail, refer to the discussion in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (2001/2002 Corporate Restructuring Program). In 2001, special items reduced operating income by $504 million and net income by $312 million, or 39 cents per diluted share. Special items of $569 million, principally related to the Companys restructuring plan approved in June 2001, were included in cost of sales ($249 million); selling, general and administrative expenses ($300 million); and research, development and related expenses ($20 million). In addition, cost of sales included other special items of $23 million related to acquisition costs. Special items included in the other expense (income) line within operating income in 2001 included $73 million of income due to the reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual related to 3Ms successful appeal in January 2002 in an antitrust case brought by LePages Inc. On February 25, 2002, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals vacated its prior ruling and ordered a re hearing by the full court. For the latest developments, refer to the discussion of Legal Proceedin gs in Part I, Item 3 of this document. Also included within the other expense (income) line within operating income is a net gain of $15 million related to the sale of available for sale equity securities, partially offset by the write down of permanently impaired available for sale equity securities. Corporate Initiatives: In 2003, the Company continued to drive its five corporate initiatives (Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, eProductivity and Indirect Cost Control) aimed at accelerating long term top line growth, improving cash flow and lowering its total cost structure. Six Sigma focuses on higher growth, productivity and cash flow. Global Sourcing Effectiveness generates savings by leveraging purchasing economies of scale, aggressively enforcing supply agreements, geographic broadening and e applications. Through its 3M Acceleration initiative, the Company is driving towards more and better new product ideas and faster, more impactful new product introductions, along with reallocating research and development resources to larger, more global projects. In eProductivity, 3M believes it has a significant opportunity to improve productivity for its customers, suppliers and for 3M itself. Indirect Cost Control focuses on reducing costs not directly associated with products or s ervices. In 2004, the Company estimates its corporate initiatives could contribute an additional $400 million to operating income. There can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. Numerous factors may create offsets to these savings, such as the potential for weakness in sales volumes, normal increases in compensation and benefits, and other inflationary pressures. The Company estimates that these initiatives provided a combined benefit to operating income of more than $400 million in 2003, after contributing more than $500 million to operating income in 2002. 18 2001/2002 Corporate Restructuring Program: The 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program actions were substantially completed by June 30, 2002. The Company estimates incremental savings under this plan of approximately $100 million on a pre tax basis in 2003, primarily in the first half of the year. The Company estimates incremental savings of $300 million on a pre tax basis in 2002, in addition to the $80 million saved in 2001. The majority of these savings were from reduced employee costs. Information regarding the restructuring is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Currency Effects: 3M estimates that currency effects, net of hedging impacts, increased net income by $73 million in 2003, reduced net income by $35 million in 2002 and reduced net income by $94 million in 2001. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN INCOME STATEMENT LINES Net Sales: 2003 2002 Worldwide U.S. International Worldwide U.S. International Net sales (millions) $ 18,232 $ 7,581 $ 10,651 $ 16,332 $ 7,426 $ 8,906 Components of net sales change: Volume core 4.7 % 0.6 % 8.2 % 1.0 % (1.6 )% 3.2 % Volume acquisitions 1.9 1.5 2.2 0.4 0.4 0.4 Volume total 6.6 2.1 10.4 1.4 (1.2 ) 3.6 Price (0.2 ) (0.3 ) 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.5 Translation 5.2 9.5 0.1 0.3 Total 11.6 % 2.1 % 19.6 % 1.7 % (1.3 )% 4.4 % In 2003, core volume growth (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired or divested in the last 12 months) was led by display enhancement films, broad based growth in most of the Health Care businesses, respirator masks, and growth in products related to construction and home improvement/home care. Acquisitions increased 2003 sales by nearly 2%, driven primarily by the December 2002 acquisition of Corning Precision Lens, Inc. On a geographic basis, 2003 core volume growth was strongest in the Asia Pacific area. Refer to both the Performance by Business Segment and Performance by Geographic Area sections for additional discussion of sales change. In 2002, the Asia Pacific area led core volume growth, driven by the Display and Graphics, Health Care, Industrial and Transportation segments. Core volume declined in the United States, with weak overall sales in Electro and Communications, and Industrial segments partially offset by good growth in the Health Care and Transportation segments. Core volume in Europe also declined, hurt by the continuing downturn in the telecom industry, partially offset by higher growth in the Health Care segment. Operating Expenses: 2003 2002 2001 2003 versus 2002 2002 versus 2001 (Percent of net sales) Cost of sales 50.9 % 52.0 % 54.5 % (1.1 )% (2.5 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.2 22.8 25.1 (0.6 ) (2.3 ) Research, development and related expenses 6.0 6.5 6.8 (0.5 ) (0.3 ) Other expense (income) 0.5 (0.6 ) 0.5 0.6 Operating income 20.4 18.7 14.2 1.7 4.5 Cost of sales in 2003 benefited from Six Sigma and other projects aimed at improving manufacturing throughput, yield and productivity. 3Ms global sourcing initiative has helped mitigate the impact of raw material price increases. Raw material costs were essentially flat versus 2002. In 2002, gross margins were positively 19 impacted by improved plant efficiencies and lower raw material costs, again helped by 3Ms global sourcing initiative. Special items, as a percent of sales, negatively impacted cost of sales by 0.7 percentage points in 2002 and 1.7 percentage points in 2001. Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales has improved in each of the past two years. SG&A expenses in U.S. dollars were higher in 2003 due to currency translation, as well as increased advertising and merchandising spending. The improvement in 2002 SG&A costs was the result of implementing Six Sigma, indirect cost control programs, and employment reductions under the restructuring plan approved in June 2001. SG&A also benefited by $67 million in 2002 due to the cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived asset amortization effective January 1, 2002. Special items negatively impacted SG&A in 2002 and 2001 ($77 million, or 0.5% of sales in 2002; $300 million, or 1.8% of sales in 2001). Excluding these 2002 special items, SG&A for 2003 was relatively flat as a percent of sales compared with 2002. Other expense (income) includes items previously discussed under special items. For 2003, this reflects the $93 million pre tax charge related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3M in 1997 by LePages Inc. For 2001, this includes a reversal of a 1999 litigation accrual of $73 million, and a gain of $15 million related to the net impact of the sale and write down of available for sale equity securities. Operating Income: 3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income has steadily improved the last two years, and in 2003 was 20.4% of sales. Although the Company faced continued economic weakness, operating income grew by $667 million in 2003, or 21.9%. In 2002, operating income grew by $773 million, or 34%, from 2001. Special items negatively impacted operating income in all years presented ($93 million, or 0.5% of sales in 2003; $202 million, or 1.2% of sales in 2002; and $504 million, or 3.1% of sales in 2001). Interest Expense and Income: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Interest expense $ 84 $ 80 $ 124 Interest income (28 ) (39 ) (37 ) Total $ 56 $ 41 $ 87 Interest Expense: The slight increase in 2003 interest expense was primarily due to a reduced benefit for capitalized interest (related to lower capital spending) and higher average debt balances being largely offset by lower interest rates. Declining interest rates on floating rate debt drove the reduction in expense in 2002. Interest Income: While average cash balances were higher in 2003, interest income decreased due to lower interest rates. The increase in 2002 was primarily related to larger average cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes: 2003 2002 2001 (Percent of pretax income) Effective tax rate 32.9 % 32.1 % 32.1 % Income taxes associated with repatriating certain cash from outside the United States negatively impacted the 2003 income tax rate. Minority Interest: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Minority interest $ 52 $ 65 $ 54 Minority interest represents the elimination of the non 3M ownership interests, primarily in Sumitomo 3M Limited and 3M Inter Unitek GmbH (in 2002 and 2001 only). The decrease in 2003 relates to 3Ms purchase of the minority interest shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH in December 2002 and the purchase of an additional 25% ownership in Sumitomo 3M in early 2003. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these acquisitions. The increase in 2002 related primarily to higher profits in 20 Sumitomo 3M and 3M Inter Unitek GmbH. Minority interest was positively impacted by special items in 2002 ($18 million) and 2001 ($8 million). PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no special items recorded in the Companys business segments for 2003 and 2002. Special items in 2001 (that were not recorded in Corporate and Unallocated) included acquisition related costs totaling $23 million ($10 million recorded in Health Care; $7 million in Display and Graphics; and $6 million in Electro and Communications). As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 3M realigned its business segments and began reporting under this new structure effective January 1, 2003. Internal management reporting for the new reportable business segments commenced January 1, 2003. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect this segment structure. The reportable segments are Health Care; Industrial; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Electro and Communications; and Transportation. Information related to 3Ms business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Local currency sales (which includes both core and acquisition volume impacts plus price impacts) are provided for each segment. The translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each segment. Performance by Business Segment Health Care Business (21.9% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 3,995 $ 3,560 $ 3,301 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.0 % 7.7 % 13.0 % Translation 6.2 0.2 (3.2 ) Total sales change 12.2 % 7.9 % 9.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,027 $ 900 $ 753 Percent change 14.1 % 19.5 % 12.9 % Percent of sales 25.7 % 25.3 % 22.8 % The Health Care segment serves markets that include medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, dental and orthodontic, health information systems and personal care. Products provided to these markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems, microbiology products, and closures for disposable diapers. In 2003, local currency growth and total sales growth in the Health Care segment was broad based. Geographic area local currency growth was led by the Asia Pacific area and the Latin America, Africa and Canada area, with the United States and Europe showing moderate growth. Operating income improvement was also broad based. In the pharmaceuticals business, an agreement was reached with Eli Lilly and Company in September of 2001 to collaborate on resiquimod, an investigational compound for the treatment of genital herpes. 3M received $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from Lilly in consideration for research and development efforts. Revenue was recognized on a pro rata basis over the service period. 3M recognized $44 million of revenue relating to this agreement in 2003, $43 million in 2002 and $7 million in 2001. In the third quarter of 2003, 3M and Eli Lilly reached a final agreement to return control of resiquimod to 3M. Upon termination of the agreement, 3M recognized the remaining revenue (with deferral of some immaterial remaining obligations). 3M continues to evaluate its strategic options with respect to this potential treatment. The broader family of immune response modifiers continues to progress and 3M expects approval of two new indications for Aldara (imiquimod) Cream, 5%, in 2004. These new indications are for actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma, potentially serious skin conditions that are a direct result of cumulative sun exposure. The patent and related rights for the imiquimod molecule are important to the Health Care Business. If approved by the FDA, the Company expects significant sales beginning in 2004 for Aldara (imiquimod) 21 Cream, 5%, for the treatment of actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma. The original patent on the imiquimod molecule expires in August 2004, but the patent term extension runs through August 2009. In October 2003, IVAX Corporation agreed to assume exclusive rights to 3Ms branded health care respiratory products, together with related marketing and sales personnel, in nine European countries. The agreement covers QVAR&reg; (beclomethasone dipropionate HFA) Inhalation Aerosol, a maintenance medication used to prevent asthma attacks, and also covers Airomir (albuterol sulfate) Inhaler, a rescue medication used to relieve acute asthma symptoms. 3M will continue to manufacture and supply these products to IVAX. The total consideration due under the agreement, including minimum annual royalty payments, was $77 million, of which $26 million was paid in 2003. 3M expects to receive $24 million in both 2004 and 2005, and $3 million in 2006. 3M may also receive additional royalty payments (up to a maximum of approximately $7 million in total) if IVAX achieves certain annual sales levels. In 2003, the combined benefit from both the Eli Lilly agreement and the IVAX Corporation agreement was partially offset by separation costs in Health Care, resulting in a net benefit to operating income of approximately $20 million. In 2002, sales and operating income growth was led by medical, dental and pharmaceutical products. Local currency growth was negatively impacted by generic competition for 3Ms Tambocor (flecainide acetate) pharmaceutical product. In December 2002, 3M acquired the remaining 43% of outstanding shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH (parent company of 3M ESPE Dental AG). Because these results have been consolidated since 2001 (when 3M acquired 57% of this business), this additional acquisition of the remaining shares had no impact on 2002 sales or operating income of the Health Care segment. Industrial Business (18.4% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 3,354 $ 3,147 $ 3,163 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 1.5 % (0.3 )% (7.6 )% Translation 5.1 (0.2 ) (3.3 ) Total sales change 6.6 % (0.5 )% (10.9 )% Operating income (millions) $ 458 $ 487 $ 457 Percent change (6.1 )% 6.6 % (28.7 )% Percent of sales 13.6 % 15.5 % 14.4 % The Industrial segment serves a broad range of industrial markets, from appliance and electronics to paper and packaging and food and beverage. Products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials and supply chain execution software solutions (acquired in early 2004). In 2003, industrial tape and electronic materials drove local currency sales growth. Geographic area local currency growth was led by the Asia Pacific area, with the United States and Europe showing declines. Acquisitions benefited sales by 1.5%. Driven by local currency sales growth, industrial tape and electronic materials also posted operating income growth. Employment reduction actions taken to improve competitiveness and lower the Industrial segments cost structure negatively impacted operating income by $27 million. In 2002, economic weakness in most areas of the manufacturing economy was the leading cause of the slight decrease in sales compared to 2001. Despite this weakness, effective cost control and increased efficiency led to an increase in operating income. Electronic materials, Dyneon brand materials and industrial tape products contributed to the operating income growth. During the third quarter of 2002, 3M finalized the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Polymer Manufacturing, Inc., Emtech Emulsion Technologies, Inc. and Emtech Manufacturing Corporation. Acquisitions benefited sales by 0.7%. 22 Display and Graphics Business (16.2% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 2,962 $ 2,228 $ 1,997 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 26.9 % 11.2 % 6.8 % Translation 6.1 0.3 (5.2 ) Total sales change 33.0 % 11.5 % 1.6 % Operating income (millions) $ 885 $ 534 $ 372 Percent change 65.8 % 43.5 % (21.5 )% Percent of sales 29.9 % 23.9 % 18.6 % The Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, touch screen, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film and lens solutions for electronic displays, touch screens and touch monitors, reflective sheeting for transportation safety and commercial graphics systems. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. The remaining lifetimes of such patents range from one to greater than 15 years. These patents provide varying measures of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products, but 3Ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of such patents. The strong 2003 local currency sales growth in the Display and Graphics segment was primarily due to optical systems growth, including the Corning Precision Lens acquisition that benefited sales by approximately 11%. Optical systems growth was led by sales of display enhancement films used in flat panel devices. Geographic area local currency sales growth was led by the Asia Pacific area and the Latin America, Africa and Canada area. Local currency growth was moderate in the United States and Europe. Optical systems also led Display and Graphics operating income growth, driven primarily by local currency sales growth and its production facilities running at high utilization levels. Sales volumes and operating income growth in 2002 were driven primarily by display enhancement films. In December 2002, 3M completed the acquisition of Corning Precision Lens, Inc., a manufacturer of lens systems for projection televisions. This acquisition added to the optical product offerings and operates under the name 3M Precision Optics, Inc. This business had 2002 net sales of approximately $270 million. Because this business was not acquired by 3M until December 2002, there was minimal impact on 2002 sales and operating income of the Display and Graphics Business. Consumer and Office Business (14.3% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 2,607 $ 2,444 $ 2,523 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 2.6 % (3.7 )% (5.9 )% Translation 4.1 0.5 (2.5 ) Total sales change 6.7 % (3.2 )% (8.4 )% Operating income (millions) $ 460 $ 448 $ 410 Percent change 2.5 % 9.3 % (6.2 )% Percent of sales 17.6 % 18.3 % 16.3 % The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, education, home improvement, building maintenance, food service and other markets. Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement/home care products, protective material products, and visual systems products. 2003 local currency growth was led by the construction and home improvement, home care, and stationery products businesses, partially offset by lower local currency sales in the visual systems business. Geographic area local currency growth was moderate in all areas except Europe, which showed a decline. The modest increase in operating income resulted from strong gains in construction and home improvement and home care, partially offset by a decrease in visual systems operating income. 23 The decrease in 2002 local currency growth reflected continued office worker layoffs and inventory contraction in the retail channel affecting office supplies. Construction and home improvement products posted good sales growth and operating income improvement, while 3Ms home care and office supply products posted strong operating income improvement. Six Sigma and costs savings from other 3M initiatives drove the operating income improvement. Safety, Security and Protection Services Business (10.6% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 1,928 $ 1,686 $ 1,639 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 9.5 % 3.3 % 5.0 % Translation 4.9 (0.5 ) (3.4 ) Total sales change 14.4 % 2.8 % 1.6 % Operating income (millions) $ 437 $ 338 $ 302 Percent change 29.1 % 11.9 % 14.0 % Percent of sales 22.7 % 20.1 % 18.4 % The Safety, Security and Protection Services segment strives to increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. This includes respiratory protection products, safety and security products, energy control products, cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles. 2003 local currency sales and operating income increases were primarily driven by the occupational health and environmental safety business, which experienced higher demand for respiratory masks, primarily resulting from concerns related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Security systems, commercial care, consumer safety and light management, and industrial mineral products also posted local currency growth and operating income improvements. All geographic areas showed local currency growth, with growth strongest in the Asia Pacific and Latin America, Africa and Canada areas. In 2002, the occupational health, industrial mineral and corrosion protection businesses led the sales and operating income improvement. Electro and Communications Business (10.0% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 1,818 $ 1,831 $ 2,107 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) (4.5 )% (13.3 )% (9.9 )% Translation 3.8 0.2 (2.2 ) Total sales change (0.7 )% (13.1 )% (12.1 )% Operating income (millions) $ 255 $ 253 $ 215 Percent change 0.8 % 17.7 % (46.1 )% Percent of sales 14.0 % 13.8 % 10.2 % The Electro and Communications segment serves manufacturers of electronic and electrical equipment, as well as the construction and maintenance segments of electric utilities, telecommunications and other industries, with products that speed the delivery of information and ideas, while also reducing costs. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, microinterconnect systems, telecommunications products and electrical products. The decrease in local currency sales in 2003 resulted from continued weakness in the global telecommunications industry. Local currency sales in 3Ms telecom business were down over 10% from 2002. Geographic area local currency growth was good in the Latin America, Africa and Canada area and the Asia Pacific area, but both the United States and Europe experienced local currency declines of more than 10%. Despite a difficult economic and market environment, benefits from 3Ms corporate initiatives helped this business slightly improve its 2003 operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by $26 million due to additional employee reductions and actions to realign this segment to its current structure. These actions were taken to provide better alignment with the market environment while maintaining focus on key customers. 24 The decrease in 2002 volumes reflected overall softness in the telecom markets. Operating income growth was broad based, except for weakness in telecom markets. Transportation Business (8.4% of consolidated sales): 2003 2002 2001 Sales (millions) $ 1,538 $ 1,388 $ 1,306 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 5.2 % 6.5 % (0.8 )% Translation 5.6 (0.2 ) (4.4 ) Total sales change 10.8 % 6.3 % (5.2 )% Operating income (millions) $ 389 $ 333 $ 270 Percent change 16.8 % 23.3 % (3.2 )% Percent of sales 25.3 % 24.0 % 20.7 % The Transportation segment serves markets that include automotive, automotive aftermarket, marine, aerospace and specialty vehicle markets. This segment provides components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and other specialty vehicles. In 2003, the automotive OEM and automotive aftermarket businesses led local currency sales and operating income growth. The aerospace and aircraft maintenance business also posted local currency and operating income growth. All geographic areas showed local currency growth, led by the Asia Pacific and Latin America, Africa and Canada areas. 2002 sales and operating income growth was led by the automotive OEM business. PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of key information and discussion related to 3Ms geographic areas follows: Net Sales and Operating Income: Geographic Area 2003 2003 vs. 2002% Change (Millions) Sales % of Total Oper. Income Sales Oper.

A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms international operations to third parties are exported to the United States and other parts of the world. Thus, net sales in a particular geography may not be indicative of end user consumption in that geography. In 2003, 3M continued its rapid expansion in emerging economies like China, Korea and Eastern Europe, complementing 3Ms growth in more mature markets. 3Ms largest international subsidiary, Sumitomo 3M, posted strong sales growth and outperformed the sluggish Japanese economy. For 2003, international operations represented 58.4% of 3Ms sales, with that percentage expected to increase in the years ahead. 25 Geographic Area Supplemental Information Employees as ofDecember 31 Capital spending Property, plant andequipment net 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (Millions, except employees) United States 33,329 35,024 36,102 $ 425 $ 422 $ 648 $ 3,342 $ 3,523 $ 3,675 Europe and Middle East 16,354 16,852 18,044 111 209 175 1,231 1,136 974 Asia Pacific 9,916 9,556 9,663 102 76 91 724 676 634 Latin America, Africa and Canada 7,473 7,342 7,860 39 56 66 312 286 332 Total Company 67,072 68,774 71,669 $ 677 $ 763 $ 980 $ 5,609 $ 5,621 $ 5,615 Employment: Employment decreased by approximately 1,700 people from year end 2002. Since March 31, 2001, employment has declined by nearly 10,600 people, with 6,900 of the decline related to the 2001/2002 corporate restructuring plan, and additional declines due to the integration of acquisitions, additional employment reduction actions and attrition. The Corning Precision Lens, Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 added approximately 1,500 employees. The Company continues to increase headcount in faster growing areas of the world, such as Asia Pacific, primarily to support increasing local sales. Sales per employee in local currencies increased approximately 8.5% in 2003, increased approximately 9% in 2002 and decreased approximately 3% in 2001. Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: The bulk of 3M capital spending has historically been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the U.S. The Company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, which will move costs outside the United States and help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations. For 2004, the Company expects to spend approximately $900 million on purchases of property, plant and equipment. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Companys pension and postretirement obligations, and potential asset impairment issues. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Legal Proceedings: Please refer to the section entitled Accrued Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K) for a description of the process the Company follows under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related guidance, for the accrual and disclosure of loss contingencies, and the categories of claims for which the Company has been able to estimate its probable liability (and where applicable, related insurance receivables), and factors affecting such estimates. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. Benefits associated with these plans are based 26 primarily on years of service and, in some cases, employee compensation. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense. A significant element in determining the Companys pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and, under certain circumstances, amortized over future years of service. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. For the U.S. pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 9.0%, which is unchanged. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how this rate is determined. The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the September 30, 2003, measurement date for the U.S. plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high, investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies. By applying this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 6.00% to be appropriate as of September 30, 2003, which is a reduction of 0.75 percentage points from the rate used as of September 30, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by $173 million (after tax). For the U.S. pension plan, holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in an after tax increase/decrease of approximately $145 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $168 million, up from $141 million in 2002. Pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $310 million in 2004, up approximately $165 million from the comparable number in 2003. For the U.S. pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by 0.25 percentage points would decrease/increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $17 million in 2004. For the U.S. pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would decrease/increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $23 million in 2004. Potential Asset Impairment Issues: Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit. Although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these long term estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results will emerge, such risk is mitigated by managements ability to make changes in these estimates and assumptions over the same long period. 3M has approximately $2.4 billion of goodwill that, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. A portion of th is goodwill (approximately $300 million) is in 3Ms telecommunications business, which the Company believes will maintain its value. However, if unanticipated events impact this sector for an extended period of time, it could create future impairment losses. 27 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow as evidenced by the reduction in net debt during 2003 as follows: At December 31 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Total Debt $ 2,937 $ 3,377 $ 2,893 Less: Cash & Cash Equiv. 1,836 618 616 Net Debt $ 1,101 $ 2,759 $ 2,277 3M believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures. The Company has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service. The Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock. The Companys financial condition and liquidity at December 31, 2003, remain strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $2.638 billion at December 31, 2003, increasing $1.036 billion from year end 2002. This increase was largely related to an increase in cash ($1.218 billion). The cash balance benefited from higher net income and certain working capital improvements (accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable). The increase in other current assets was offset by an increase in accrued income taxes. The increase in other current assets was primarily due to the reclassification of certain insurance receivables from long term to current, and increases in various prepaid items and deferred taxes. The increase in accrued income taxes primarily relates to higher net i ncome, a higher effective tax rate, and the timing of tax payments. The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities (e.g. accounts receivable, inventory). These measures may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The accounts receivable turnover index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable) totaled 6.95 at December 31, 2003, an improvement from 6.55 at year end 2002. Receivables increased $187 million compared with year end 2002, with currency translation increasing the accounts receivable balance by $222 million (due to the weaker U.S. dollar). The inventory turnover index (defined as quarterly factory cost fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending inventory) was 5.12 at December 31, 2003, an improvement from 4.17 at year end 2002. Inventories declined $115 million compared with year end 2002, despite currency translation increasing the inventory balance by $143 million compared with December 31, 2002. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Net income $ 2,403 $ 1,974 $ 1,430 Depreciation and amortization 964 954 1,089 Company pension contributions (749 ) (1,086 ) (157 ) Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) 539 568 212 Accounts receivable 38 145 345 Inventories 281 279 194 Accounts payable 62 138 (156 ) Other net 235 20 121 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,773 $ 2,992 $ 3,078 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In both 2003 and 2002, cash flows were primarily driven by improved net income, certain working capital improvements (i.e. accounts receivables, inventories, accounts payable) and tax timing differences. In 2003 and 2002, significant Company 28 pension contributions negatively impacted cash flow. In all years, with larger amounts in 2003 and 2002, a portion of the tax timing benefit relates to the tax benefit received from Company pension contributions. In 2003, 3M made $46 million of payments under the corporate restructuring plan, compared with $306 million in 2002 and $159 million in 2001. 3Ms pension plan assets were below 3Ms accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at its most recent plan measurement dates for certain plans. In the third quarter of 2003, 3M made a voluntary, special contribution of $600 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan compared with a voluntary, special contribution of $789 million in the third quarter of 2002. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. The Company recorded the LePages verdict liability of $93 million pre tax in the first quarter of 2003. The Company increased its estimate of liabilities for the breast implant and respirator mask/asbestos claims and litigation in 2003. For a more detailed discussion of these and other legal proceedings, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Because of the time delay between payment of claims and receipt of insurance reimbursements, the December 31, 2003, amounts for both breast implant and respirator mask/asbestos liabilities are less than expected insurance recoveries. Thus, the expected net inflow of cash will increase future cash flows. The following table shows liability and receivable activity for breast implant and respirator masks/asbestos for 2003 and 2002. This table shows the increase in liabilities and associated insurance receivables, cash received for insurance, cash fees and payments made, and the pre tax expense by year. At December 31 2003 2002 (Millions) Breast implant liabilities: Balance at beginning of year $ 5 $ 20 Increase in liability during year 18 Cash fees and payments made (10 ) (15 ) Balance at end of year $ 13 $ 5 Breast implant receivables: Balance at beginning of year $ 339 $ 406 Increase in receivable during year 16 Cash received from insurance (17 ) (67 ) Balance at end of year $ 338 $ 339 Breast implant pre tax expense recorded $ 1.5 $ Respirator mask/asbestos liabilities: Balance at beginning of year $ 161 $ 156 Increase in liability during year 231 67 Cash fees and payments made (103 ) (62 ) Balance at end of year $ 289 $ 161 Respirator mask/asbestos receivables: Balance at beginning of year $ 264 $ 223 Increase in receivable during year 205 67 Cash received from insurance (21 ) (26 ) Balance at end of year $ 448 $ 264 Respirator mask/asbestos pre tax expense recorded $ 26 $ LePages verdict liability and pre tax expense $ 93 $ 29 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $ (677 ) $ (763 ) $ (980 ) Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets 129 83 113 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (439 ) (1,258 ) (218 ) Purchases and proceeds from sale of investments net 18 11 35 Net cash used in investing activities $ (969 ) $ (1,927 ) $ (1,050 ) Investments in property, plant and equipment are helping to meet product demand and increase manufacturing efficiency. In 2003, cash used for acquisitions of businesses included $377 million related to the purchase of an additional 25% ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited. Additional cash used totaling $62 million included six additional business combinations and finalization of the purchase of Corning Precision Lens, Inc. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on business combinations. 3M completed two significant transactions in 2002. First, 3M purchased Corning Precision Lens, Inc. for approximately $850 million, or approximately $680 million after considering the net present value of the joint election tax benefit under Section 338(h)(10), which allows goodwill to be fully deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years. Second, 3M purchased the 43% minority shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH for approximately $304 million. The Company also entered into seven other business combinations in 2002 for a total of $104 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $35 million of 3M common stock. There were three significant business combinations in 2001. 3M acquired MicroTouch Systems Inc., a touch screen manufacturer, for $158 million in cash, net of cash acquired. 3M also acquired Robinson Nugent, Inc., a telecommunications supplier, in exchange for $127 million of 3M common stock. The Company also combined its German dental business (3M Inter Unitek GmbH, an existing 3M subsidiary) with ESPE Dental AG, a dental products manufacturer. 3M Inter Unitek GmbH acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ESPE Dental AG in exchange for 43% ownership in 3M Inter Unitek GmbH and $25 million, net of cash acquired. Upon completion of this transaction, and as of December 31, 2001, 3M held a 57% controlling interest in 3M Inter Unitek GmbH. As previously stated, 3M purchased the remaining minority interest shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH in 2002. Acquisition activity in 2001 also included the purchase, for less than $50 million, of five smaller companies that had combined annual sales of less than $50 million in total. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions. In the first quarter of 2004, 3M entered into two business combination agreements, neither of which impacted 2003 operating results or the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. 3M announced in February 2004 that it had completed the acquisition of HighJump Software, Inc., a U.S. company with annual sales of approximately $36 million that provides supply chain execution software and solutions. The total purchase price of approximately $67 million included $24 million in cash (net of cash acquired) plus 541,581 shares of 3M common stock. The common stock had a market value of approximately $43 million at the acquisition measurement date and was previously held as 3M treasury stock. In March 2004, 3M completed the acquisition of Hornell International, a Swedish company, for approximately $100 million in cash, including assumption of debt. Hornell is a global supplier of personal protective equipment with annual sales of approximately $50 million. The purchase price allocations of the aforementioned business combinations have not been finalized. Proceeds from the sale of investments in 2003 include $26 million of cash received related to the sale of 3Ms 50% ownership in Durel Corporation to Rogers Corporation. Purchases of investments totaled $16 million in 2003, $7 million in 2002 and $12 million in 2001. These purchases include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. 30 Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (Millions) Change in short term debt net $ (215 ) $ (204 ) $ (20 ) Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (719 ) (497 ) (1,564 ) Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 494 1,146 1,693 Total change in debt $ (440 ) $ 445 $ 109 Purchases of treasury stock (685 ) (942 ) (1,322 ) Reissuances of treasury stock 555 522 462 Dividends paid to stockholders (1,034 ) (968 ) (948 ) Distributions to minority interests and other net (23 ) (78 ) (17 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,627 ) $ (1,021 ) $ (1,716 ) Total debt at December 31, 2003, was $2.937 billion, down from $3.377 billion at year end 2002, due to the strong cash flow generated during 2003. There were no new long term debt issuances in 2003, but the Companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (classified as short term borrowings) were remarketed for one year in December 2003. The remarketable securities can be remarketed annually, at the option of the dealer, for a year each time, with a final maturity date of December 2010. Total debt was 27% of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity), compared with 36% at year end 2002. In 2003, the cash flow decrease in net short term debt of $215 million includes the portion of short term debt with original maturities of 90 days or less. The repayment of debt of $719 million included repayment of $366 million related to commercial paper having original maturities greater than 90 days and repayment of $353 million related to other debt with maturities greater than 90 days. Proceeds from debt of $494 million primarily related to commercial paper having original maturities greater than 90 days. In 2002, repayment of debt primarily related to commercial paper, while proceeds from debt included $550 million from the issuance of convertible debt. In September 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the potential offering of debt securities of up to $1.5 billion. This shelf registration became effective in October 2003. In December 2003, the Company established under the shelf a medium term notes program, through which up to $1.5 billion of medium term notes may be offered. 3M plans to use the net proceeds from future issuances of debt securities under this registration for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to 3M subsidiaries, or the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion. As of December 31, 2003, there had been no issuances against the shelf. On November 15, 2002, 3M sold $639 million in aggregate face amount of 30 year zero coupon senior notes (the Convertible Notes) that are convertible into shares of 3M common stock. The gross proceeds from the offering, to be used for general corporate purposes, were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs). The book value at December 31, 2003, was $553 million. On February 14, 2003, 3M registered these Convertible Notes in a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The terms of the Convertible Notes include a yield to maturity of .50% and an initial conversion premium of 40% over the $65.00 (split adjusted) closing price of 3M common stock on November 14, 2002. If certain conditions for conversion (relating to the closing common stock prices of 3M exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods) are met, holders may convert each of the 30 year zero coupon senior notes into 9.4602 shares of 3M common stock in any calendar quarter commencing after March 31, 2003. If the conditions for conversion are met, and 3M elects not to settle in cash, the 30 year zero coupon senior notes will be convertible in the aggregate into approximately 6.0 million shares of 3M common stock. 3M may redeem the 30 year zero coupon senior notes at any time in whole or in part, after five years at the greater of the accreted conversion price or the current market price. Holders of the 30 year zero coupon senior notes have the option to require 3M to purchase their notes at accreted value in years three, five, 10, 15, 20 and 25. 3M may choose to pay the redemption purchase price in cash and or common stock. Debt issuance costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period beginning in November 2002. The conditions for conversion were not met for any of the quarters of 2003; accordingly, there was no impact on 3Ms diluted earnings per share. 31 Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In November 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Companys common stock. This share repurchase authorization was effective from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. Under this authorization, the Company purchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $685 million in 2003, compared with approximately 15.8 million shares for $942 million in 2002. On November 10, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Companys common stock between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004. The change in annual weighted average diluted shares outstanding (including the effects of repurchases, issuances and dilution) resulted in a penalty of 2 cents per diluted share in 2003 and a benefit of 3 cents per diluted share in 2002. There was no impact in 2001. Cash dividends paid to stockholders in 2003 totaled $1.034 billion ($1.32 per share), $968 million ($1.24 per share) in 2002 and $948 million ($1.20 per share) in 2001. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2004, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock to 36 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.44 per share. This marks the 46th consecutive year of dividend increases. Other cash flows from financing activities include distributions to minority interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. Liquidity: The Companys liquidity remains strong. Primary short term liquidity needs are provided through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2003, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $444 million and averaged approximately $474 million during 2003. Medium term note shelf borrowing capacity totaled $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2003. Credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a $565 million, 364 day credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks. The facility provides up to $90 million in letters of credit ($89 million of which was outstanding at December 31, 2003). Committed credit facilities of $42 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations. The Company also has uncommitted lines of credit totaling $617 million. The Company expects to renew the committed lines of credit facilities in 2004. The Company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations, if necessary. At year end 2003, certain debt agreements ($565 million of short term lines of credit, $350 million of dealer remarketable securities, and the $238 million of ESOP debt) had ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. The Company currently has AA/Aa1 debt ratings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: As of December 31, 2003, the Company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements. 3Ms guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are estimated at approximately $18 million. 3Ms accrued product warranty liabilities are estimated at approximately $20 million. 3M does not consider these amounts to be material. In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require 3M to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property. While 3Ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. 32 A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003, follows: Contractual Obligations Payments due by year Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After 2008 (Millions) Long term debt (including current portion) $ 2,121 $ 386 $ 437 $ 39 $ 40 $ 42 $ 1,177 Operating leases 333 75 59 41 31 15 112 Capital leases 102 5 4 4 4 4 81 Unconditional purchase obligations 557 323 96 26 24 17 71 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,113 $ 789 $ 596 $ 110 $ 99 $ 78 $ 1,441 Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and se rvices are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis. As discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2004. Thus, Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2004 and future years. Contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending in 2004 and beyond. For 2004, the Company expects to spend approximately $900 million on purchases of property, plant and equipment. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection swaps and forward physical contracts. A variance/co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the Companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2003. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. Based on this analysis of the Companys interest rate risks, possible changes in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on after tax earnings ($6 million at December 31, 2003 and $7 million at December 31, 2002). Based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks, possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings 33 by $67 million ($69 million at December 31, 2002). When including certain commodity risks, possible changes in commodity rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by an additional $3 million (an additional $11 million at December 31, 2002). The model used analyzed over 20 different currencies and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The Company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, which will move costs outside the United States. This will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations. In 2001, the Company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings. However, this hedging program will not make 3M immune to currency impacts. The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10% price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $28 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge less than one percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to partially hedge about 18% of this energy exposure. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7, contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of words like plan, expect, aim, believe, project, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could and similar expressions in connection with any discussion, expectation, or projection of future operating or financial performance, events or trends. In particular, these include statements about the Companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Factors That Could Affect Future Results Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Results and trends are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic conditions. The Company operates in more than 60 countries and derives more than half of its revenues from outside the United States. The Companys business may be affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region; social, political or labor conditions in a specific country or region; or potential adverse foreign tax consequences. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations. Because the Company derives more than half of its revenues from outside the United States, its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. The Companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to: identify viable new products; obtain adequate intellectual property protection; gain market acceptance of new products, or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals. For example, new 3M pharmaceutical products, like any pharmaceutical under development, face substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review. There are no guarantees that products will receive regulatory approvals or prove to be commercially successful. In particular, the Companys expectations rely in part on obtaining regulatory approval by about mid year 2004 for two additional indications for Aldara (imiquimod) Cream, 5% .. 34 The Companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs of purchased components and materials due to market demand, currency exchange risks, material shortages and other factors. The Company depends on various components and materials for the manufacturing of its products. Although the Company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining components and materials, it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Companys receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand, currency risks, or material shortages, or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. There is the possibility that acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations. As part of the Companys strategy for growth, the Company has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances. However, there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the Company. The Companys future results may be affected if the Company receives less savings from its corporate initiatives than estimated. 3Ms corporate initiatives (in 2003, these initiatives included Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, eProductivity and Indirect Cost Control) are expected to contribute an additional $400 million to operating income in 2004. There can be no assurance that all of the estimated savings from the initiatives will be realized. The Companys future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving product liability, antitrust, environmental or other matters. The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Companys expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. A specific factor that may influence the Companys estimate of its future asbestos related liabilities is the pending Congressional consideration of legislation to reform asbestos related litigation and pertinent information derived from that process. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and associated accounting estimates, see the discussion of Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this document. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the context of Item 7A, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Debt, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The Company does not have leveraged derivative positions. 35
