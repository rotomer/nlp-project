Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. 3M manages its operations in seven operating business segments: Health Care; Industrial; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Electro and Communications; and Transportation. 3Ms performance in 2004 was broad based, with strong performance and growth in Display and Graphics, but 3M also had success in established businesses like Industrial; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Consumer and Office. All seven business segments contributed to sales growth in 2004. In 2004, 3M reported record net sales of $20.011 billion and record net income of $2.990 billion, or $3.75 per diluted share, compared with net sales of $18.232 billion and net income of $2.403 billion, or $3.02 per diluted share, in 2003. The combination of a 9.8% increase in net sales, including core volume sales growth of 6.2% (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months), and declining operating expenses as a percent of sales, resulted in a 22.9% operating income profit margin.

Sales growth in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment was driven by continued demand for personal protection products along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products. Sales growth in the Consumer and Office segment was broad based, with the Transportation segment led by both the automotive OEM and repair markets. The Health Care segment experienced tough year on year comparisons through the first three quarters of the year, with improvement in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the Electro and Communications segment, this was the first year of positive sales growth since 2000. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments. Asia Pacific local currency sales (which excludes translation impacts) increased 13.6%, with the strongest growth in China, Korea and Taiwan. All seven business segments contributed to this increase. U.S. sales revenue increased 3.9%, with growth led by Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and the Industrial businesses. European local currency sales increased 0.8%, with growth in Safety, Security and Protection Services; Transportation; Industrial; and Health Care. In the combined Latin America, Africa and Canada area, six of seven businesses had local currency sales increases, led by Electro and Communications; Transportation; Industrial; and Health Care. Foreign currency translation positively impacted European sales by 8.9%, Asia Pacific sales by 5.6%, and the combined Latin America, Africa and Canada area by 2.4%, as the U.S. dollar weakened against these currencies. Refer to the Performance by Geographic Area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective areas. Operating income in 2004 increased by 23.3% versus 2003, as all seven business segments posted increases. The combination of solid sales growth and positive benefits from 3Ms 2004 corporate initiatives drove the operating income increase. Cost reduction projects related to these initiatives Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration and eProductivity contributed over $400 million in aggregate operating income benefits in 2004 (see Note A at the end of this Overview section). Currency impacts, related primarily to the weaker U.S. dollar, boosted 2004 operating income by an estimated $286 million, partially offset by increased 18 pension expense of $157 million. Operating income in 2003 was negatively impacted by a $93 million pre tax charge related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3M in 1997 by LePages Inc. 3M generated $4.282 billion of operating cash flows in 2004, a $509 million increase over 2003, and ended the year with $2.757 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Cash flow in 2004 was primarily driven by higher net income. In 2004, the Company utilized $2.916 billion of cash to repurchase 3M common stock and pay dividends, and contributed $591 million to its pension plans. 3Ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) as of December 31, 2004, was approximately 21%. 3M has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service. In 2005, 3M expects to continue its momentum to drive sales, operational efficiency and cash flow growth. 3M is looking for continued broad based product sales to drive its growth, in addition to expected continued growth in optical film products, and will also continue to assess potential acquisitions. Continued core volume sales growth will require both faster growth of existing products/services and successful introduction of new products. While international sales now represent 61% of worldwide sales, the Company will also focus on execution of sales and growth opportunities in the United States. In part to energize the 3M Acceleration initiative, early in 2004 the Company launched an extensive effort to reconnect and re engage with customers. This will aid 3M in its continuing quest to provide additional customer value, with both the customer and 3M benefiting through value creation and also facilitating 3Ms ability to achieve appropriate pricing. The Company also is focused on its corporate initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. Cost reduction projects related to these initiatives are expected to contribute an additional $400 million to operating income in 2005. The Company has experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting several oil derived raw materials, but to date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results, although the Company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact. 3M will also continue, as it has for many years, to incur expenses (insured and uninsured) in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward looking statements discussion later in Item 7 for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). (Note A). The Companys five corporate initiatives (Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, eProductivity and Global Business Processes) are aimed at accelerating long term top line growth, improving cash flow and lowering its total cost structure. Indirect Cost Control, which focused on reducing costs not directly associated with products or services, is no longer a formal initiative and is now managed using a productivity metric. Six Sigma focuses on higher growth, productivity and cash flow. Global Sourcing Effectiveness generates savings by leveraging purchasing economies of scale, encouraging competition among suppliers, geographic broadening and e applications. Through its 3M Acceleration initiative, the Company is driving toward more and better new product ideas and faster, more impactful new product introductions, along with reallocating research and development resources to larger, more global projects. In eProductivity, 3M believes it has a significant opportunity to improve productivity for its customers, suppliers and for 3M itself. 3Ms Global Business Processes initiative continues 3Ms ongoing effort to standardize, simplify and strengthen its business processes in order to increase the speed, efficiency and quality of service functions vital to its business operations worldwide. There can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. Numerous factors may create offsets to these savings, such as the potential for weakness in sales volumes, normal increases in compensation and benefits, and other inflationary pressures. The Company estimates that cost reduction projects related to initiatives provided a combined incremental benefit to operating income of more than $400 million in 2004, after contributing a similar amount in 2003. These initiatives provided an incremental benefit to operating income of more than $500 million in 2002. 19 INDEX TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: Reference (pages) Item 7 Results of operations 20 Performance by business segment 22 Performance by geographic area 27 Critical accounting estimates 28 New accounting pronouncements 29 Financial condition and liquidity 30 Financial instruments 34 Forward looking statements 35 Item 7A Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales: 2004 2003 Worldwide U.S. International Worldwide U.S. International Net sales (millions) $ 20,011 $ 7,878 $ 12,133 $ 18,232 $ 7,581 $ 10,651 Components of net sales change: Volume core 6.2 % 3.2 % 8.2 % 4.7 % 0.6 % 8.2 % Volume acquisitions 0.5 0.8 0.3 1.9 1.5 2.2 Volume total 6.7 4.0 8.5 6.6 2.1 10.4 Price (0.7 ) (0.1 ) (1.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Local currency 6.0 3.9 7.4 6.4 2.1 10.1 Translation 3.8 6.5 5.2 9.5 Total 9.8 % 3.9 % 13.9 % 11.6 % 2.1 % 19.6 % In 2004, core volume growth (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months) was broad based, with all seven businesses posting worldwide local currency sales growth. Local currency growth was led by Display and Graphics; Industrial; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and the Transportation businesses. Health Care local currency sales increased 1.7%, as results were negatively impacted by 2003 sales from pharmaceutical and drug delivery agreements that did not repeat in 2004. Electro and Communications local currency sales increased 0.3%, the first year of positive growth since 2000. Acquisitions increased 2004 sales by 0.5%, driven by the 2004 acquisitions of HighJump Software, Inc. and Hornell Holding AB. Internationally, selling prices declined 1.1%, with most of the decline coming in certain businesses that serve the electronics industry, where it is important to look at the combined impact of volume and price. On a geographic basis, local currency sales growth in 2004 was led by the Asia Pacific area. Refer to both the Performance by Business Segment and Performance by Geographic Area sections for additional discussion of sales change. In 2003, core volume growth (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months) was led by display enhancement films, broad based growth in most of the Health Care businesses, personal protection products, and growth in products related to construction and home improvement/home care. Acquisitions increased 2003 sales by nearly 2%, driven primarily by the December 2002 acquisition of Corning Precision Lens, Inc. On a geographic basis, 2003 core volume growth was strongest in the Asia Pacific area. 20 Operating Expenses: (Percent of net sales) 2004 2003 2002 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 Cost of sales 49.8 % 50.9 % 52.0 % (1.1 )% (1.1 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 21.6 22.2 22.8 (0.6 ) (0.6 ) Research, development and related expenses 5.7 6.0 6.5 (0.3 ) (0.5 ) Other expense 0.5 (0.5 ) 0.5 Operating income 22.9 20.4 18.7 2.5 1.7 Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Cost of sales decreased 1.1 percentage points in both 2004 and 2003. The 2004 decrease as a percent of net sales was driven by a combination of higher volumes, productivity gains, ongoing benefits of corporate initiatives and positive currency impacts (including hedging impacts). While 3M raw material costs increased during the year, 3Ms global sourcing initiative was important in enabling 3M to minimize raw material cost increases during a period of commodity price inflation. Cost of sales in 2003 benefited from Six Sigma and other projects aimed at improving manufacturing throughput, yield and productivity. 3Ms global sourcing initiative has helped mitigate the impact of raw material price increases. In 2003, raw material costs were essentially flat versus 2002. Charges related to the 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program negatively impacted cost of sales by 0.7 percentage points in 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses have improved by 0.6 percentage points in each of the past two years. The improvement in 2004 as a percent of net sales was helped by leverage related to 3Ms strong growth in the Asia Pacific area. SG&A expenses in U.S. dollars increased in 2004, negatively impacted by currency translation and increased advertising and merchandising spending to support 3Ms strong brand portfolio. On an ongoing basis, the Company is shifting SG&A dollars toward faster growth businesses and geographic areas. SG&A expenses in U.S. dollars in 2003 increased due to currency translation, as well as higher advertising and merchandising spending. Charges related to the 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program negatively impacted SG&A in 2002 by $77 million, or 0.5% of sales. Excluding these charges, SG&A for 2003 was relatively flat as a percent of sales compared with 2002. Other Expense: In 2003, 3M recorded pre tax charges of $93 million ($58 million after tax, or 7 cents per diluted share) related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3M in 1997 by LePages Inc. The pre tax charge of $93 million is classified as Other expense within operating income. For more detail, refer to the discussion of Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this document. 2001/2002 Corporate Restructuring Program: In 2002, charges related to the 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program reduced operating income by $202 million and net income by $108 million. These charges principally related to employee severance and benefit costs, accelerated depreciation charges, and other associated exit costs under the Companys restructuring plan announced in June 2001. These charges are included in cost of sales ($121 million); selling, general and administrative expenses ($77 million); and research, development and related expenses ($4 million). The 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program actions were substantially completed by June 30, 2002. The Company estimated incremental savings under this plan of approximately $100 million on a pre tax basis in 2003, primarily in the first half of the year. The Company estimated incremental savings of $300 million on a pre tax basis in 2002. The majority of these savings were from reduced employee costs. For more detail, refer to the discussion in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (2001/2002 Corporate Restructuring Program). Operating Income: 3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income in 2004 was 22.9% of sales, up from 20.4% of sales in 2003 and 18.7% of sales in 2002. Operating income in 2004 grew by $865 million, or 23.3 percent, following 2003 operating income growth of $667 million, or 21.9%. The LePages Inc. lawsuit negatively impacted operating income in 2003 by $93 million, or 0.5% of sales. The 2001/2002 corporate restructuring program negatively impacted operating income in 2002 by $202 million, or 1.2% of sales. 21 Interest Expense and Income: (Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Interest expense $ 69 $ 84 $ 80 Interest income (46 ) (28 ) (39 ) Total $ 23 $ 56 $ 41 Interest Expense: The decrease in 2004 interest expense was primarily the result of lower average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates in the United States. The slight increase in 2003 interest expense was primarily due to a reduced benefit from capitalized interest (related to lower capital spending) and higher average debt balances, largely offset by lower interest rates. Interest Income: Interest income increased in 2004 due to substantially higher cash balances. In 2003, while average cash balances were higher than in 2002, interest income decreased due to lower interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes: (Percent of pretax income) 2004 2003 2002 Effective tax rate 33.0 % 32.9 % 32.1 % The tax rate of 33.0% for 2004 was comparable to the 2003 rate of 32.9%. Income taxes associated with repatriating certain cash from outside the United States negatively impacted the 2004 and 2003 income tax rates. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the possible impact on the 2005 tax rate. Minority Interest: (Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Minority interest $ 62 $ 52 $ 65 Minority interest represents the elimination of the non 3M ownership interests, primarily in Sumitomo 3M Limited and 3M Inter Unitek GmbH (in 2002 only). The increase in 2004 related primarily to higher net income in Sumitomo 3M, as 3M eliminates the non 3M ownership portion of net income. The decrease in 2003 related to 3Ms purchase of the minority interest shares of 3M Inter Unitek GmbH in December 2002 and the purchase of an additional 25% ownership in Sumitomo 3M in early 2003. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these acquisitions. Currency Effects: 3M estimates that year on year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income by $181 million in 2004 and $73 million in 2003, and reduced net income by $35 million in 2002. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reportable segments are Health Care; Industrial; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Electro and Communications; and Transportation. Information related to 3Ms business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Local currency sales (which include both core and acquisition volume impacts, plus price impacts) are provided for each segment. The translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each segment. Effective January 1, 2005, as part of the continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers, the Electronics Markets Materials Division and certain high temperature and display tapes (2004 sales of approximately $350 million) within the Industrial Business transferred to the Electro and Communications Business, and the converter markets product line (2004 sales of approximately $10 million) within the Transportation Business transferred to the Display and Graphics Business. Internal management reporting for these business segment transfers commenced January 1, 2005. Segment information for all periods presented will be reclassified in 2005 to reflect the new segment structure. 22 Health Care Business (21.1% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 4,230 $ 3,995 $ 3,560 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 1.7 % 6.0 % 7.7 % Translation 4.2 6.2 0.2 Total sales change 5.9 % 12.2 % 7.9 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,123 $ 1,027 $ 900 Percent change 9.3 % 14.1 % 19.5 % Percent of sales 26.5 % 25.7 % 25.3 % The Health Care segment serves markets that include medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, dental and orthodontic, health information systems and personal care. Products provided to these markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems, microbiology products, and closures for disposable diapers. In 2004, local currency sales in Health Care increased 1.7%, with the first nine months of 2004 negatively impacted by 2003 pharmaceutical and drug delivery agreements that did not repeat. Fourth quarter 2004 local currency sales grew 5.0%, as year on year comparisons became more favorable. Operating income increased 9.3% to $1.123 billion in 2004. The 3M product platform of immune response modifiers (IRMs) continues to progress. 3M received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in March 2004 to market Aldara (imiquimod) Cream, 5%, for the treatment of certain types of actinic keratosis (a pre cancerous skin condition). In July 2004, the FDA granted approval for Aldara for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma (a common form of non melanoma skin cancer). The patent and related rights for the imiquimod molecule are important to the Health Care Business. The original patent on the imiquimod molecule expired in August 2004, but the patent term extension runs through August 2009. In the pharmaceuticals business, an agreement was reached with Eli Lilly and Company in September of 2001 to collaborate on resiquimod, an investigational compound for the treatment of genital herpes. 3M received $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from Lilly in consideration for research and development efforts. Revenue was recognized on a pro rata basis over the service period. 3M recognized $44 million of revenue relating to this agreement in 2003, $43 million in 2002 and $7 million in 2001. In the third quarter of 2003, 3M and Eli Lilly reached a final agreement to return control of resiquimod to 3M. Upon termination of the agreement in 2003, 3M recognized the majority of the remaining revenue (with deferral of some immaterial remaining obligations until 2004 when the obligations were finalized). In October 2003, IVAX Corporation agreed to assume exclusive rights to 3Ms branded health care respiratory products, together with related marketing and sales personnel, in nine European countries. The agreement covered QVAR (beclomethasone dipropionate HFA) Inhalation Aerosol, a maintenance medication used to prevent asthma attacks, and also covered Airomir (albuterol sulfate) Inhaler, a rescue medication used to relieve acute asthma symptoms. 3M will continue to manufacture and supply these products to IVAX. The total consideration due under the agreement, including minimum annual royalty payments, was $77 million, of which $26 million was paid in 2003 and $24 million was paid in 2004. 3M expects to receive $24 million in 2005 and $3 million in 2006. 3M may also receive additional royalty payments (up to a maximum of approximately $7 million in total) if IVAX achieves certain annual sales levels. The Company recognizes the royalty revenue related to the IVAX agreement ratably over the term of the licensing arrangement. In 2003, local currency growth and total sales growth in the Health Care segment was broad based. Geographic area local currency growth was led by the Asia Pacific area and the Latin America, Africa and Canada area, with the United States and Europe showing moderate growth. Operating income improvement was also broad based. In 2003, the combined benefit from both the Eli Lilly agreement and the IVAX Corporation agreement was partially offset by separation costs in Health Care, resulting in a net benefit to operating income of approximately $20 million. 23 Industrial Business (19.0% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 3,792 $ 3,354 $ 3,147 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 9.1 % 1.5 % (0.3 )% Translation 4.0 5.1 (0.2 ) Total sales change 13.1 % 6.6 % (0.5 )% Operating income (millions) $ 661 $ 458 $ 487 Percent change 44.5 % (6.1 )% 6.6 % Percent of sales 17.4 % 13.6 % 15.5 % The Industrial segment serves a broad range of industrial markets, from appliance and electronics to paper and packaging and food and beverage. Products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials and supply chain execution software solutions. Industrial local currency sales growth of 9.1% for the year was broad based across major geographic areas and Industrial businesses. Acquisitions increased sales by 1.2%, driven by the February 2004 acquisition of HighJump Software, Inc., a provider of supply chain execution software. Strong local currency sales growth helped leverage operating income growth. Operating income increased 44.5% to $661 million in 2004. In 2003, industrial tape and electronic materials drove local currency sales growth. Geographic area local currency growth was led by the Asia Pacific area, with the United States and Europe showing declines. Acquisitions increased sales by 1.5%. Driven by local currency sales growth, industrial tape and electronic materials also posted operating income growth. Employment reduction actions taken to improve competitiveness and lower the Industrial segments cost structure negatively impacted operating income. Display and Graphics Business (17.0% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 3,406 $ 2,962 $ 2,228 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 10.4 % 26.9 % 11.2 % Translation 4.6 6.1 0.3 Total sales change 15.0 % 33.0 % 11.5 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,131 $ 885 $ 534 Percent change 27.8 % 65.8 % 43.5 % Percent of sales 33.2 % 29.9 % 23.9 % The Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, touch screen, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film and lens solutions for electronic displays; touch screens and touch monitors; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; and commercial graphics systems. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. The remaining lifetimes of such patents range from one to greater than 15 years. These patents provide varying measures of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. 3Ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of such patents. Display and Graphics local currency sales growth was 10.4% for 2004. Strong demand for 3M films that brighten the displays on electronic products, such as flat panel computer monitors, cellular phones, notebook PCs and LCD televisions, continued to drive results in 2004. Year on year local currency sales growth in the Optical Systems business was slower in the last half of 2004, primarily due to inventory channel adjustments in the LCD market. This resulted in reduced demand for 3Ms proprietary optical films and components. While this business is subject to periodic customer inventory fluctuations, 3M believes that this business will continue to be a significant growth engine for 3M. In the fourth quarter of 2004, 3M announced the phase out of its commercial videotape business, and this action, combined with a continuing decline in lens systems for the CRT rear projection television market, negatively impacted sales and operating income. Operating income increased 27.8% to $1.131 billion in 2004. 24 The strong 2003 local currency sales growth in the Display and Graphics segment was primarily due to optical systems growth, including the Corning Precision Lens acquisition that benefited sales by approximately 11%. Optical systems growth was led by sales of display enhancement films used in flat panel devices. Geographic area local currency sales growth was led by the Asia Pacific area and the Latin America, Africa and Canada area. Local currency growth was moderate in the United States and Europe. Operating income increased 65.8% to $885 million in 2003, driven primarily by local currency sales growth, production facilities running at high utilization levels and benefits from 3Ms corporate initiatives. Consumer and Office Business (14.3% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 2,861 $ 2,607 $ 2,444 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.9 % 2.6 % (3.7 )% Translation 2.8 4.1 0.5 Total sales change 9.7 % 6.7 % (3.2 )% Operating income (millions) $ 542 $ 460 $ 448 Percent change 17.9 % 2.5 % 9.3 % Percent of sales 18.9 % 17.6 % 18.3 % The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, education, home improvement, building maintenance and other markets. Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement/home care products, protective material products, and visual systems products. In 2004, local currency sales growth in Consumer and Office was 6.9%. Sales growth was fairly broad based across the many retail channels 3M serves, most notably in mass market consumer retail and home improvement. This included strong sales growth in construction and home improvement/home care products, office supply products and stationery products. Geographic area local currency growth was led by the United States. Operating income increased 17.9% to $542 million in 2004. 2003 local currency growth was led by the construction and home improvement, home care, and stationery products businesses, partially offset by lower local currency sales in the visual systems business. Geographic area local currency growth was moderate in all areas except Europe, which showed a decline. The modest increase in operating income resulted from strong gains in construction and home improvement and home care, partially offset by a decrease in visual systems operating income. Safety, Security and Protection Services Business (10.6% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 2,125 $ 1,928 $ 1,686 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.6 % 9.5 % 3.3 % Translation 3.6 4.9 (0.5 ) Total sales change 10.2 % 14.4 % 2.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 491 $ 437 $ 338 Percent change 12.3 % 29.1 % 11.9 % Percent of sales 23.1 % 22.7 % 20.1 % The Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that strive to increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, safety and security products, energy control products, cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles. Safety, Security and Protection Services local currency sales growth was 6.6% in 2004. Local currency growth was driven by strong global demand for personal protective products and solutions, along with cleaning and protective products for commercial buildings. 3Ms acquisition of Hornell Holding AB, a European based global supplier of 25 personal safety equipment, added 2.3 percentage points of growth in 2004. Operating income increased 12.3% to $491 million in 2004. 2003 local currency sales and operating income increases were primarily driven by the occupational health and environmental safety business, which experienced higher demand for respiratory masks, primarily resulting from concerns related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Security systems, commercial care, building safety solutions, and industrial mineral products also posted local currency growth and operating income improvements. All geographic areas showed local currency growth, with growth strongest in the Asia Pacific and Latin America, Africa and Canada areas. Electro and Communications Business (9.4% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 1,876 $ 1,818 $ 1,831 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 0.3 % (4.5 )% (13.3 )% Translation 2.9 3.8 0.2 Total sales change 3.2 % (0.7 )% (13.1 )% Operating income (millions) $ 291 $ 255 $ 253 Percent change 14.1 % 0.8 % 17.7 % Percent of sales 15.5 % 14.0 % 13.8 % The Electro and Communications segment serves manufacturers of electronic and electrical equipment, as well as the construction and maintenance segments of electric utilities, telecommunications and other industries, with products that speed the delivery of information and ideas, while also reducing costs. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, microinterconnect systems, telecommunications products and electrical products. Local currency sales in Electro and Communications increased 0.3% for 2004, led by electrical products for insulating, testing and sensing. Sales in the electronics and telecommunications segments were negatively impacted by the general slowdown in the semiconductor industry and continued softness in the hard line infrastructure segment of the telecommunications market. Geographically, local currency growth in this business for 2004 was led by the Latin America, Africa and Canada area along with the Asia Pacific area. Operating income was up 14.1% to $291 million in 2004. The decrease in local currency sales in 2003 resulted from continued weakness in the global telecommunications industry. Local currency sales in 3Ms telecom business were down over 10% from 2002. Geographic area local currency growth was good in the Latin America, Africa and Canada area and the Asia Pacific area, but both the United States and Europe experienced local currency declines of more than 10%. Despite a difficult economic and market environment, benefits from 3Ms corporate initiatives and productivity actions helped this business slightly improve its 2003 operating income. Operating income in 2003 was negatively impacted by $26 million due to additional employee reductions and actions to provide better alignment with the market environment while maintaining focus on key customers. 26 Transportation Business (8.4% of consolidated sales): 2004 2003 2002 Sales (millions) $ 1,683 $ 1,538 $ 1,388 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 5.2 % 5.2 % 6.5 % Translation 4.2 5.6 (0.2 ) Total sales change 9.4 % 10.8 % 6.3 % Operating income (millions) $ 428 $ 389 $ 333 Percent change 10.1 % 16.8 % 23.3 % Percent of sales 25.4 % 25.3 % 24.0 % The Transportation segment serves markets that include automotive, automotive aftermarket, marine, aerospace and specialty vehicle markets. This segment provides components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. In Transportation, local currency sales growth was 5.2% in 2004. Top line growth in this business continues to benefit from new products and solutions for customers, along with a strategy of replicating successful 3M solutions across several distinct segments of the transportation industry. Operating income increased 10.1% to $428 million in 2004. In 2003, the automotive OEM and automotive aftermarket businesses led local currency sales and operating income growth. The aerospace and aircraft maintenance business also posted local currency sales and operating income growth. All geographic areas showed local currency sales growth, led by the Asia Pacific and Latin America, Africa and Canada areas. PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary of key information and discussion related to 3Ms geographic areas follows: Geographic Area 2004 2004 vs. 2003% Change Net Sales and Operating Income (Dollars in millions) Sales % of Total Oper.

Export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. Thus, net sales in a particular geography may not be indicative of end user consumption in that geography. U.S. 2004 sales growth was led by the Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and the Industrial businesses. U.S. operating income was down 1%, as higher year on year pension expense impacted operating income by 12%. European local currency sales increased 0.8%, with growth in Safety, Security and Protection Services; Transportation; Industrial; and Health Care. Favorable exchange rates, coupled with ongoing productivity efforts, boosted operating income in Europe by 24.4% to almost $1 billion. Local currency sales growth in the Asia Pacific area was 13.6%, with all seven business segments posting positive local currency sales growth. 3M posted 4.3% local currency sales gains in Japan, despite a fairly sluggish economic picture in the second half of 2004. Growth in the rest of the Asia Pacific area was 20.7%, led by China, Korea and Taiwan. In the combined Latin America, Africa and Canada area, six of seven businesses had local currency sales increases, led by Electro and Communications; Transportation; Industrial; and Health Care. For 2004, international operations represented 60.6% of 3Ms sales. 27 Geographic Area Supplemental Information (Millions, except employees) Employees as of December 31 Capital Spending Property, Plant and Equipment net 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 United States 32,648 33,329 35,024 $ 565 $ 425 $ 422 $ 3,290 $ 3,342 $ 3,523 Europe and Middle East 16,250 16,354 16,852 143 111 209 1,284 1,231 1,136 Asia Pacific 10,439 9,916 9,556 182 102 76 810 724 676 Latin America, Africa and Canada 7,734 7,473 7,342 47 39 56 327 312 286 Total Company 67,071 67,072 68,774 $ 937 $ 677 $ 763 $ 5,711 $ 5,609 $ 5,621 Employment: Employment was virtually unchanged from year end 2003. Since March 31, 2001, employment has declined by nearly 10,600 people, with 6,900 of the decline related to the 2001/2002 corporate restructuring plan, and additional declines due to the integration of acquisitions, additional employment reduction actions and attrition. The Corning Precision Lens, Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 added approximately 1,500 employees. The Company continues to increase headcount in faster growing areas of the world, such as Asia Pacific, primarily to support increasing local sales. Sales per employee in local currencies increased approximately 7% in 2004, 8.5% in 2003 and approximately 9% in 2002. Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: The bulk of 3M capital spending historically has been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the U.S. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 60% of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements. For 2005, the Company expects to spend approximately $950 million on purchases of property, plant and equipment. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Companys pension and postretirement obligations, and potential asset impairment issues. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors. Legal Proceedings: Please refer to the section entitled Accrued Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K) for a description of the process the Company follows for the accrual and disclosure of loss contingencies, the categories of claims for which the Company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for the estimate of its related insurance receivables, and factors affecting such estimates. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense. 28 As previously disclosed in the Companys June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 Form 10 Qs, in 2004, the Companys U.S. plan measurement date was changed from September 30 to December 31. The primary reasons for this change include consistency between the U.S. and international dates, the increased clarity that results from having the same measurement and balance sheet dates, and administrative simplification. This change did not have a material impact on the determination of periodic pension cost or pension obligations. A significant element in determining the Companys pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on projected results for similar allocations among asset classes. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and, under certain circumstances, amortized over future years of service. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. For the U.S. pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 9.00% for 2004. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how this rate is determined. The Company is lowering the 2005 expected return on plan assets by 0.25 percentage points to 8.75%. The discount rate used to measure pension plan liabilities reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled as of December 31, 2004. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high, investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies. By applying this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.75% to be appropriate as of December 31, 2004, which is a reduction of 0.25 percentage points from the rate used as of September 30, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by $1.193 billion (after tax). This increase was primarily the result of the assets being above the Accumulated Benefit Obligation for the U.S. qualified plan, which caused the minimum pension liability recorded for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to be reversed. As a result, the Companys U.S. qualified plan recorded a Prepaid Pension Asset of $1.851 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $325 million, up from $168 million in 2003. Pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $342 million in 2005. As previously mentioned, the Company lowered the expected return on assets assumption from 9.00% in 2004 to 8.75% in 2005. For the U.S. pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by 0.25 percentage points would decrease/increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $19 million in 2005. For the U.S. pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would decrease/increase U.S. pension expense by approximately $30 million in 2005. Potential Asset Impairment Issues: 3M net property, plant and equipment totaled approximately $5.7 billion at December 31, 2004. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit. In addition, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004, which, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. A portion of this goodwill (approximately $300 million) is in 3Ms telecommunications business, which competes in a very uncertain industry. While the Company believes this business will maintain its value, events such as a significant adverse change in the business climate, could create future impairment losses. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, which requires recognition of an expense when goods or services are provided. SFAS No. 123R requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R effective July 1, 2005. Additional information regarding this and other accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow as evidenced by the reduction in net debt during 2004 as follows: At December 31 (Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Total Debt $ 2,821 $ 2,937 $ 3,377 Less: Cash & Cash Equiv. 2,757 1,836 618 Net Debt $ 64 $ 1,101 $ 2,759 3M believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures. The Company has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service. The Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock. The Companys financial condition and liquidity at December 31, 2004, remained strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $2.649 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with $2.638 billion at December 31, 2003. This slight increase was primarily related to an increase in cash ($921 million) offset by an increase in debt classified as short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt ($892 million). The cash balance benefited from higher net income and working capital improvements in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities (i.e. accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable). These measures may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The accounts receivable turnover index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable) totaled 7.29 at December 31, 2004, an improvement from 6.95 at December 31, 2003. Receivables increased $78 million compared with December 31, 2003, with currency translation of $120 million (due to the weaker U.S. dollar) driving this increase. The inventory turnover index (defined as quarterly factory cost fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending inventory) was 5.29 at December 31, 2004, an improvement from 5.12 at December 31, 2003. Inventories increased $81 million compared with December 31, 2003, with currency translation of $80 million accounting for almost all of this increase. Another working capital measure used by the Company also reflects the impact of accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.78 at December 31, 2004, an improvement from 5.48 at December 31, 2003. Accounts payable increased $81 million compared to December 31, 2003. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 2,990 $ 2,403 $ 1,974 Depreciation and amortization 999 964 954 Company pension contributions (591 ) (749 ) (1,086 ) Company pension expense 325 168 141 Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) 396 539 568 Accounts receivable 56 38 145 Inventories 7 281 279 Accounts payable 35 62 138 Other net 65 67 (121 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,282 $ 3,773 $ 2,992 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In both 2004 and 2003, cash flow improvements were primarily driven by higher net income, tax timing differences and certain working capital improvements (i.e. accounts receivables, inventories, accounts payable). In all periods presented, significant 30 Company pension contributions negatively impacted cash flows. In all years, with larger amounts in 2003 and 2002, a portion of the tax timing benefit relates to the tax benefit received from Company pension contributions. In 2003, 3M made $46 million of payments under the corporate restructuring plan, compared with $306 million in 2002. In the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company made a special pension contribution to 3Ms Japanese pension plan of $155 million and a discretionary contribution of $300 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan. In the third quarter of 2003, 3M made a discretionary contribution of $600 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan, compared with a discretionary contribution of $789 million in the third quarter of 2002. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. The following table recaps for breast implant and respirator masks/asbestos litigation the liabilities and associated insurance receivables, cash received from insurance, cash fees and payments made, and the pre tax expense for 2004 and 2003. Because of the time delay between payment of claims and receipt of insurance reimbursements, the December 31, 2004, amounts for both breast implant and respirator mask/asbestos liabilities are less than expected insurance recoveries. Thus, the expected net inflow of cash will increase future cash flows. The Company recorded the LePages verdict liability of $93 million pre tax in the first quarter of 2003. For a more detailed discussion of these and other legal proceedings, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

In the first three months of 2004, 3M entered into two business combination agreements. 3M acquired HighJump Software, Inc., a U.S. company that provides supply chain execution software and solutions with annual sales of approximately $36 million. 3M initially purchased 91 percent of the outstanding shares of Hornell Holding AB and subsequently acquired all of the remaining outstanding shares. Hornell Holding AB is a global supplier of personal protective equipment for welding applications with annual sales of approximately $50 million. In August 2004, 3M acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Info X Inc., a U.S. company that provides coding compliance software and data for health care organizations, with annual sales of approximately $10 million. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these 2004 business combinations and for information concerning 2003 and 2002 business combinations. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions. Proceeds from the sale of investments in 2003 include $26 million of cash received related to the sale of 3Ms 50% ownership in Durel Corporation to Rogers Corporation. Purchases of investments totaled $10 million in 2004, $16 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These purchases include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Change in short term debt net $ 399 $ (215 ) $ (204 ) Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (868 ) (719 ) (497 ) Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 358 494 1,146 Total change in debt $ (111 ) $ (440 ) $ 445 Purchases of treasury stock (1,791 ) (685 ) (942 ) Reissuances of treasury stock 508 555 522 Dividends paid to stockholders (1,125 ) (1,034 ) (968 ) Distributions to minority interests and other net (15 ) (23 ) (78 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,534 ) $ (1,627 ) $ (1,021 ) Total debt at December 31, 2004, was $2.821 billion, down from $2.937 billion at year end 2003, due to the strong cash flow generated during 2004. In 2004, the cash flow increase in net short term debt of $399 million includes the portion of short term debt with original maturities of 90 days or less. The repayment of debt of $868 million primarily related to commercial paper retirements of approximately $475 million and the retirements of $350 million in medium term notes. Proceeds from debt of $358 million primarily related to commercial paper issuances. Total debt was 21% of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity), compared with 27% at year end 2003. Debt securities, including the Companys shelf registration, its medium term notes program, dealer remarketable securities and Convertible Note are all discussed in more detail in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has a shelf registration and medium term notes program through which $1.5 billion of medium term notes may be offered. In 2004, the Company issued approximately $62 million in debt securities under its medium term notes program. The medium term notes program and shelf registration have remaining capacity of approximately $1.438 billion. The Companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (classified as current portion of long term debt) were remarketed for one year in December 2004. In addition, the Company has a Convertible Note with a book value of $556 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the dealer remarketable securities, Convertible Note and $62 million of medium term notes are classified as current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. However, the Company 32 does not anticipate redemption of these securities in 2005. For a discussion of accounting pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the Convertible Note, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of EITF Issue No. 04 08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share and proposed SFAS No. 128R, Earnings per Share. Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. On November 10, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Companys common stock between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004. In November 2004, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $200 million of the Companys common stock in 2004 and also authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the Companys common stock between January 1, 2005 and January 31, 2006. Refer to the table captioned Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5, for more information. Cash dividends paid to stockholders totaled $1.125 billion ($1.44 per share) in 2004, $1.034 billion ($1.32 per share) in 2003 and $968 million ($1.24 per share) in 2002. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2005, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock to 42 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.68 per share. This marks the 47th consecutive year of dividend increases. Other cash flows from financing activities include distributions to minority interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. Liquidity: The Companys liquidity remains strong. Primary short term liquidity needs are provided through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2004, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $671 million and averaged approximately $387 million during 2004. Medium term note shelf borrowing capacity totaled $1.438 billion as of December 31, 2004. Credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a $565 million, 364 day credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks. This facility provides up to $115 million in letters of credit ($86 million of which was utilized at December 31, 2004). In 2005, it is anticipated that the 364 day credit agreement will be replaced by a five year agreement with terms substantially the same as that of the current agreement. Committed credit facilities of $53 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations. The Company also has uncommitted lines of credit outside the United States totaling $637 million. The Company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations, if necessary. At year end 2004, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable securities and $202 million of ESOP debt) had ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. The Company currently has AA/Aa1 debt ratings. In addition, the $565 million, 364 day credit agreement requires 3M to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 0.60 to 1 at the end of each quarter. This ratio is calculated as funded debt (including all borrowed money and letters of credit utilized) to the sum of funded debt and equity. At December 31, 2004, this ratio was approximately 0.22 to 1. 3Ms cash balance at December 31, 2004 totaled $2.757 billion. 3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of more than $1.1 billion in 2004, and has a long history of dividend increases. 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of the Companys common stock between January 1, 2005 and January 31, 2006. The Company may also make additional contributions to its pension plan in the future, but exact amounts are uncertain and will depend on market conditions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: As of December 31, 2004, the Company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements. 3Ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $22 million. 3M does not consider this amount to be material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material. In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require 3M to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe 33 third party patents or other intellectual property. While 3Ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, follows: Contractual Obligations Payments due by year (Millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After 2009 Long term debt (including current portion) $ 2,132 $ 1,405 $ 39 $ 40 $ 42 $ 44 $ 562 Operating leases 340 93 56 39 19 15 118 Capital leases 106 5 5 4 5 5 82 Unconditional purchase obligations 368 154 70 46 17 11 70 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,946 $ 1,657 $ 170 $ 129 $ 83 $ 75 $ 832 Long term debt payments due in 2005 include $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity 2010), $62 million of medium term notes (final maturity 2044), and $556 million of convertible notes (final maturity 2032). These securities are classified as current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis. As discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2005. Thus, Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2005 and future years. Contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending in 2005 and beyond. For 2005, the Company expects to spend approximately $950 million on purchases of property, plant and equipment. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection swaps and forward physical contracts. 34 A variance/co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the Companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2004. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. Based on this analysis of the Companys interest rate risks, possible changes in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on after tax earnings ($5 million at December 31, 2004 and $6 million at December 31, 2003). Based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks, possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by $61 million ($67 million at December 31, 2003). When including certain commodity risks, possible changes in commodity rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by an additional $10 million (an additional $3 million at December 31, 2003). The model used analyzed over 20 different currencies and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 60% of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States. This will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations. In 2001, the Company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings. However, this hedging program will not make 3M immune to currency impacts. The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $44 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10% price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $30 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge less than one percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10% of this energy exposure. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7, contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of words like plan, expect, aim, believe, project, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could and similar expressions in connection with any discussion, expectation or projection of future operating or financial performance, events or trends. In particular, these include statements about the Companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Factors That Could Affect Future Results Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Results and trends are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic conditions. The Company operates in more than 60 countries and derives approximately 60% of its revenues from outside the United States. The Companys business may be affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region; social, political or labor conditions in a specific country or region; or potential adverse foreign tax consequences. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations. Because the Company derives approximately 60% of its revenues from outside the United States, its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. The Companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to: identify viable new products; obtain adequate intellectual property protection; gain market acceptance of new products; or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals. For example, new 3M pharmaceutical products, like any pharmaceutical under development, face substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful. 35 The Companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components and materials, including oil derived compounds, due to market demand, currency exchange risks, material shortages and other factors. The Company depends on various components and materials supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted or terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Companys receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand, currency risks or material shortages, or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. There is the possibility that acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations. As part of the Companys strategy for growth, the Company has made and may continue to make acquisitions and enter into strategic alliances. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to quickly integrate the acquired business and obtain the anticipated synergies or that acquisitions and strategic alliances will be beneficial to the Company. The Companys future results may be affected if the Company generates less operating income from its corporate initiatives than estimated. 3Ms corporate initiatives include Six Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, eProductivity and Global Business Processes. Cost reduction projects related to these initiatives are expected to contribute an additional $400 million to operating income in 2005. There can be no assurance that all of the estimated operating income improvements from the initiatives will be realized. The Companys future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving product liability, antitrust, environmental or other matters. The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Companys expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. A specific factor that may influence the Companys estimate of its future asbestos related liabilities is the pending Congressional consideration of legislation to reform asbestos related litigation and pertinent information derived from that process. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and associated accounting estimates, see the discussion of Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this document. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the context of Item 7A, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Long Term Debt and Short Term Borrowings, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The Company does not have leveraged derivative positions. 36
