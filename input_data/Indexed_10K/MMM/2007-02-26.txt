Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. 3M manages its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Electro and Communications. 3Ms strategy emphasizes a commitment to grow at a faster pace, using a four pronged approach, which includes reinvesting in its core businesses, developing adjacent emerging business opportunities, expanding on the Companys already world class capabilities outside the United States, and acquiring companies in faster growing industries. 3Ms reinvestment in the core is evidenced through its 2006 investments in new production capacity in a number of growing and highly profitable businesses, such as medical, respiratory protection, LCD films and others. In addition, 3M is investing in research and development, which should position our existing business portfolio for accelerated growth. 3M launched five new emerging business opportunities, including our Track and Trace initiative, global mining, food safety, filtration, and energy. 3M made great progress on its Track and Trace initiative in 2006, merging a number of formerly disparate efforts into one single growth engine for the future. Track and Trace has a growing array of applications from tracking packages to managing medical and legal records. 3M continued to build its capabilities in many of the worlds fastest growing emerging economies in 2006. 3M began construction of three new plants in China, one in Russia, one in Poland and one in India. By the end of 2007, 3M expects to have 10 or more plants open or under construction in China. 3M also drove outstanding growth in more developed countries. European sales growth was about 10% in U.S. dollars, and 8.3% in local currencies. 11 3M closed on 19 acquisitions in 2006, all contributing to growth in different ways. Acquisitions were made to add products and gap fillers, to expand our offerings and become more important to our customers, to add capacity, to get access to local markets via local brands, and to augment our existing technology base. With a continued focus on these strategies into 2007, 3M believes it can transform itself into a faster growing company. The Company expects to increase both research and development (excluding the pharmaceuticals business, acquired in process research and development charge and restructuring related items) and capital expenditures in 2007, with investments in growth programs around the world. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.522 billion in 2006. This included a $95 million in process research and development charge (discussed in Note 2) and approximately $75 million in restructuring related items (discussed in Note 4). Adjusted for these items, research, development and related expenses still increased by over 6%. Total capital expenditures for 2006 totaled $1.168 billion, up $225 million compared with 2005. The Company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2007, providing the capacity to meet expected growth. 3M announced in April 2006 that it would explore strategic alternatives for its global branded pharmaceuticals business. 3M believes that in todays very competitive pharmaceuticals marketplace, continued success in brand pharmaceuticals requires broad pipelines of new drugs, significant investments, and a longer term risk reward model than applies to most other 3M businesses. In December 2006 and January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business. As discussed in Note 2, the January 2007 transaction will be recorded in the first quarter of 2007. As previously disclosed, 3M had indicated that it would likely incur some restructuring related costs associated with selling the business. As a result of the above, in the fourth quarter of 2006, 3M recorded a gain on sale, which was partially offset by restructuring and other items. Including these items, in 2006, 3M reported record net sales of $22.923 billion and record net income of $3.851 billion, or $5.06 per diluted share, compared with net sales of $21.167 billion and net income of $3.111 billion, or $3.98 per diluted share. Excluding these items, the Company still achieved strong underlying operating performance, helped by the combination of an 8.3% increase in net sales, including core local currency sales growth of 5.6% (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months). In 2006, the gain on sale, net of restructuring and other items, increased operating income by $523 million and net income by $438 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre tax, $674 million after tax) and favorable income tax adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by restructuring actions ($403 million pre tax, $257 million after tax), acquired in process research and development expenses ($95 million pre tax and after tax), settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($40 million pre tax, $25 million after tax), and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million pre tax, $8 million after tax). These items are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures), Note 4 (2006 Restructuring Actions), Note 8 (Income Taxes), and Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies). In 2005, 3M adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FASB) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, and repatriated approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings to the United States pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (refer to Note 1 and Note 8 for more detail). Combined, these two items reduced net income by $110 million in 2005. The following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for discussion of the net impact of the gain on sale, restructuring and other items that increased Health Care operating income, but which reduced most of the other business segments operating income. 12 2006 2005 2006 vs. 2005 % change Net % of Oper.

Sales growth in the Industrial and Transportation segment was led by industrial adhesives and tapes, along with the automotive aftermarket business. Acquisitions, primarily CUNO, added 4.6% to Industrial and Transportation sales growth. Sales growth in Health Care was led by 3Ms core medical and dental businesses. Display and Graphics sales growth was led by display enhancement films used in flat panel devices and strong growth in the commercial graphics business. Sales growth in the Consumer and Office segment was broad based across the many channels 3M serves, most notably in the mass market consumer and home improvement retail channels. Sales growth in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment was driven by continued strong demand for personal protection products and solutions, particularly respiratory protection products. Acquisitions, primarily Security Printing and Systems Limited, which was acquired in August 2006, added 4.0% to Safety, Security and Protection Services sales growth. For the Electro and Communications segment, sales growth was led by demand for 3M electronic products for semiconductor manufacturers, along with continued strong growth in electrical products for insulating, testing and sensing. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments. Geographically, U.S. sales revenue increased 7.1%, Asia Pacific local currency sales (which exclude translation impacts) increased 9.2%, European local currency sales increased 8.3%, and the combined Latin America and Canada area local currency sales increased 6.1%. Refer to the Performance by Geographic Area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective areas. Operating income improvement for the year, excluding the gain on the branded pharmaceuticals sale and restructuring and other items, was led by the Industrial and Transportation segment and the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment. Display and Graphics was hurt by sales price declines, a sales mix shift towards larger LCD displays, and operational challenges related to the Companys new optical film manufacturing production line, which have since been resolved. The Display and Graphics segment and Electro and Communications segment were impacted the most by business specific restructuring actions (Note 4 and business segment discussion). 3Ms operating income margins remained at healthy levels, even after adjusting for net gains related to the branded pharmaceuticals sale, restructuring and other items. For the year 2006, the Company utilized $3.7 billion of cash to repurchase 3M common stock and pay dividends. In August 2006, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases of the Companys stock, raising the total authorization to $3 billion between February 13, 2006 and February 28, 2007. As of December 31, 2006, $748 million remained available for repurchases. In February 2007, 3Ms Board authorized a dividend increase of 4.3% to 48 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.92 per share for 2007, marking the 49th consecutive year of dividend increases, and also approved a $7 billion two year share repurchase authorization for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. 3Ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) as of December 31, 2006 was 26%. 3M has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service. In 2006, the Company experienced price increases affecting metals, wood pulp and oil derived raw materials. During the fourth quarter of 2006 total market demand for metals and oil derived raw materials began to soften and the Company is therefore pursuing price reductions for those commodities. The Company to date is receiving sufficient 13 quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements, but it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results, although the Company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact. 3M continued, as it has for many years, to incur expenses (insured and uninsured) in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies. The sale of the pharmaceuticals business is not presented as a discontinued operation due to the extent of the projected continuing cash flows from our contractual supply relationship with the buyers in relation to those of the business that was sold. Therefore, it will create both a sales and profitability comparability issue beginning with first quarter 2007 results. Annual sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals were $774 million, and reported operating income was $1.039 billion, including net gains of $783 million as discussed in the Pharmaceuticals Business discussion that follows. Sales growth in 2007 will be negatively impacted as these pharmaceutical sales are in the base 2006 period. 3Ms Drug Delivery Systems Division will be a source of supply to the acquiring companies, with expected annual revenues of approximately $100 million from the various arrangements with the three buyers. Such outsourcing arrangements involve a lower profitability than the other product and service offerings of most of our existing Health Care businesses. 3M restructured many areas in parallel with divesting the global branded pharmaceuticals business. The great majority of those costs will not be eliminated until late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2007. Earnings growth is expected to be slowest in the first quarter of 2007 due to these continued expenses and the strong comparable first quarter in 2006. 3M expects earnings to improve somewhat in the second quarter of 2007, and accelerate more into the second half of the year. Beginning in 2007, the Company is modifying its long term and short term incentive compensation programs to align employee and shareholder interests more closely. The Companys short term incentive compensation plan is moving away from its quarterly year over year focused profit sharing plan toward an annual bonus plan with payouts tied principally to performance measured by the operating plan. The Company is also reducing the number of traditional stock options granted under its long term incentive compensation plan by reducing the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units. These changes will reduce the annual dilution impact from 1.5% of total outstanding common stock to about 1%. However, associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees, the Company decided to provide a one time buyout grant to the impacted employees, which will result in increased stock based compensation expense in 2007. In addition, 3Ms change in the vesting period for stock options from one to three years starting with the May 2005 grant also results in higher expense in 2007 compared with 2006. Stock based compensation expense is expected to total $0.21 per diluted share in 2007, compared with $0.17 per diluted share in 2006. The preceding forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward looking statements section in Item 7 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2006, 3M adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which required 3M to expense stock based compensation. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified retrospective method. Effective January 1, 2006, all prior periods were revised to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. Stock based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is summarized by business segment in the table that follows. Stock based compensation expense Year ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Industrial and Transportation $ 51 $ 47 $ 74 Health Care 42 35 58 Display and Graphics 27 19 34 Consumer and Office 24 21 34 Safety, Security and Protection Services 21 16 26 Electro and Communications 20 17 26 Corporate and Unallocated 15 Total Company $ 200 $ 155 $ 252 14 The $45 million increase in stock option expense in 2006, compared with 2005, is primarily due to two reasons. First, effective January 1, 2006, accounting rules required the acceleration of stock based compensation expense recognition to when an employee is eligible to retire, instead of over the entire vesting period for these retirement eligible employees, resulting in recognition of approximately 25 percent of the expense in the month of grant (second quarter for 3Ms annual stock option grant). Second, 3M changed its vesting period from one to three years starting with the May 2005 grant. The third and fourth quarters of 2006 include expense from both the 2005 and 2006 stock option grants, while the third and fourth quarters of 2005 only include expense from the 2005 stock option grant. The decrease in the 2005 expense, compared with 2004, is primarily due to the change in 3Ms option vesting period.

The following table summarizes these impacts by operating expense category. Additional details on restructuring actions are in Note 4. Items included in the Other category of the table are acquired in process research and development expenses ($95 million), settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($40 million), and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million).

Approximately 1.2 percentage points of this increase related to numerous items, such as higher raw material costs, slightly lower selling prices, and higher costs associated with scaling up additional manufacturing capacity. In addition, there were supply chain inefficiencies caused by capacity constraints. Finally, we accelerated the pace of acquisitions in 2006, which increased cost of sales slightly for the year. After these acquisitions are integrated and begin meaningful contributions to growth, we expect positive impacts. Broad based sales volume growth and productivity gains helped offset some of this impact. Raw material costs increased approximately 3% for 2006, compared with 2005. Restructuring and other items also negatively impacted cost of sales by $143 million, or 0.7 percentage points. Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Cost of sales decreased 0.8 of a percentage point in 2005. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales benefited from the combination of improved selling prices, favorable product mix, productivity gains, factory efficiency and sourcing, which helped offset the impact of higher raw material prices. Raw material costs increased approximately 6% for 2005, compared with 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the same period in 2005. In dollars, SG&A increased $435 million, with restructuring and other items increasing SG&A by $238 million, and other spending increasing SG&A by $197 million. 3M continues to invest in growth oriented SG&A as sales and marketing costs increased faster than sales, while administrative expenses remained relatively flat in dollars, attributable in part to cost control efforts. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 0.3 of a percentage point when comparing 2005 with 2004, primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense driven by the change in vesting period from one to three years (further discussed in Note 1). 3M continued to invest in growth programs and brand building throughout the portfolio as a means of stimulating growth. SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2005 was impacted by a pre tax charge of approximately $30 million in connection with settlement agreements of one antitrust class action and two individual such actions, all involving direct purchasers of transparent tape. Research, Development and Related Expenses: Research, development and related expenses increased as a percent of sales by 0.6 of a percentage point, or $248 million, when comparing 2006 with 2005, while decreasing as a percent of sales by 0.2 of a percentage point when comparing 2005 to 2004. The 2006 spending included a $95 million in process research and development charge (discussed in Note 2) and $75 million in restructuring actions (Note 4). Other spending increased approximately $78 million, representing an increase of approximately 6% compared with 2005, reflecting 3Ms continuing commitment to fund future growth for the Company. Gain on Sale of Pharmaceuticals Business: In December 2006, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals businesses in the United States, Canada, and Latin America region and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. 3M received proceeds of $1.209 billion for these transactions and recognized a pre tax gain on sale of $1.074 billion. In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe to Meda AB for $817 million. 16 This transaction will be reflected in 3Ms financial statements for the period ending March 31, 2007. For more detail, refer to Note 2. Operating Income: 3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income in 2006 was 24.8% of sales, up from 22.9% of sales in 2005 and 21.6% of sales in 2004. Operating income in 2006 included the gain on sale, restructuring and other items that benefited operating income by $523 million, or 2.2% of net sales. Interest Expense and Income: (Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense $ 122 $ 82 $ 69 Interest income (51 ) (56 ) (46 ) Total $ 71 $ 26 $ 23 Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily related to increased short term debt levels and higher interest rates. Interest expense increased in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to higher interest rates. Interest Income: Interest income was lower in 2006, with lower average cash balances partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income was higher in 2005, benefiting primarily from higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes: (Percent of pre tax income) 2006 2005 2004 Effective tax rate 30.6 % 33.7 % 32.5 % The tax rate for 2006 was 30.6%, compared with 33.7% in 2005. In 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act). Refer to the following paragraph for additional discussion. No similar repatriation occurred in 2006 since this Jobs Act provision only applied to 2005. As a result, the Companys tax rate decreased by 1.6% in 2006. In addition, the Companys tax rate was reduced by 1.5% as a result of a number of items (both positive and negative), including adjustments to its reserves for tax contingencies, the sale of its pharmaceutical business and book/tax differences on the write off of in process research and development related to the Brontes Technologies Inc. (Brontes) acquisition. Refer to Note 2 and Note 8 for additional information. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 33.7%, compared with 32.5% in 2004. During 2005, 3M completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) and repatriated approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the United States pursuant to its provisions. The Jobs Act provided 3M the opportunity to tax effectively repatriate foreign earnings for U.S. qualifying investments specified by 3Ms domestic reinvestment plan. As a consequence, in the second quarter of 2005, 3M recorded a tax expense of $75 million, net of available foreign tax credits, which negatively impacted the 2005 effective worldwide tax rate by 1.6%. A half point tax rate reduction, compared with 2004, was primarily attributable to a combination of the effects of the Medicare Modernization Act and the domestic manufacturers deduction, which was a part of the Jobs Act. Minority Interest: (Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Minority interest $ 51 $ 55 $ 62 Minority interest expense eliminates the income or loss attributable to non 3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. 3Ms most significant consolidated entity with non 3M ownership interests is Sumitomo 3M Limited in Japan (3M owns 75% of Sumitomo 3M Limited). The decrease in 2006 related primarily to foreign currency translation effects which reduced Sumitomo 3M Limiteds operating income as reported in U.S. dollars, as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the Japanese yen, compared with 2005. The decrease in 2005 related primarily to lower net income in Sumitomo 3M. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change: As of December 31, 2005, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). This accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and where the liability can be reasonably 17 estimated. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the Companys long term assets. The fair value of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59 million at December 31, 2005 and an after tax charge of $35 million for 2005, which was reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The pro forma effect of applying this guidance in all prior periods presented was determined not to be material. At December 31, 2006, the asset retirement obligation liability was $57 million. Currency Effects: 3M estimates that year on year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income by approximately $20 million in 2006, $115 million in 2005 and $181 million in 2004. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year on year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an immaterial impact on net income in 2006 and increased net income by approximately $50 million in 2005 and $48 million in 2004.

The August 2005 acquisition of CUNO adds a comprehensive line of filtration products for the separation, clarification and purification of fluids and gases. In 2006, local currency sales grew 9.1%, including 4.6% growth from acquisitions, primarily related to the August 2005 acquisition of CUNO. Since CUNO was acquired in early August 2005 and is thus considered part of organic growth effective in August 2006, the acquisition benefit reflected in 2006 only reflects the months from January 2006 through July 2006. The industrial adhesives and tapes business, along with the automotive aftermarket business, which sells products to body shops for vehicle repairs, led organic sales growth in 2006. 3M also posted good sales growth in its abrasives business and its energy and advanced materials business. Growth in the automotive OEM business continues to be impacted by softness in the U.S. domestic automotive industry as new car builds continue to remain soft. Geographically, local currency sales growth in dollars was strongest in the Asia Pacific and Europe areas. Operating income increased 10.9% to $1.343 billion in 2006. Operating income included $15 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.2%. In 2005, Industrial and Transportation local currency sales grew 6.5%. The August 2005 CUNO acquisition, whose results are included in Industrial and Transportation, added 3.1% of growth in 2005. In addition, growth was led by the adhesives, tapes, and abrasives businesses. 3M continued to selectively raise selling prices to offset commodity raw material price pressures. 3M sales growth also benefited from customer focused new products and productivity solutions driving results. One of these new products is 3M Paint Replacement Film, which is an alternative to using paint around car and truck windows. In the automotive aftermarket area, the 3M Paint Preparation System shortens paint changeover and cleanup time while also reducing the use of solvents for cleaning paint guns. Sales growth in transportation was led by businesses that serve the automotive OEMs and auto body repair shops, despite challenges in the U.S. OEM Big 3 automotive market along with lower levels of distribution buy in (due to cash flow trade offs by customers in the automotive aftermarket business). The strength of the Industrial and Transportation businesses helped overcome the sales growth challenges of the personal care business. Personal care, which is 3Ms diaper tape business, has experienced significant raw material price increases in some product lines over the past year, and 3M has elected to drive profits at the expense of volume in this business. Industrial and Transportation continues to demonstrate strong operational discipline, as operating income grew 15.4% in 2005. In March 2005, 3Ms automotive business completed the purchase of 19% of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&M), the parent company of I&T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&T), a maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry founded in Austria in 1999. 3M and I&T intended to collaborate to deliver flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. The purchase price of approximately $55 million is reported in 2005 as Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and as Purchases of marketable securities and investments in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Due to its distribution involvement and voting rights, the Company is using equity method accounting for its investment in TI&M. I&T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&M, the Company was granted a put option, which gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&M to the other investors from whom 3M acquired its 19% interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and has recovered approximately half of its investment from one of the other investors. The other two TI&M investors have filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria. The Company is in the process of seeking to collect the balance of its investment. 19 Health Care Business (17.5% of consolidated sales): 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 4,011 $ 3,760 $ 3,596 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.0 % 4.2 % 0.6 % Translation 0.7 0.4 4.2 Total sales change 6.7 % 4.6 % 4.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,845 $ 1,114 $ 973 Percent change 65.6 % 14.6 % 7.2 % Percent of sales 46.0 % 29.6 % 27.0 % The Health Care segment serves markets that include medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, dental and orthodontic, and health information systems. Products provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems and microbiology products. As discussed below, the global branded pharmaceuticals business was sold in December 2006 and January 2007. In total, the combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2006 Health Care operating income by $673 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006. As discussed in Note 2, in early December 2006, the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. The Company also sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the United States, Canada and Latin America in late December 2006. The operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in Health Care, totaled $1.074 billion. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, the Health Care segment for the year 2006 included $293 million in restructuring costs, primarily employee related severance and benefit costs. Of the $293 million, $166 million was related to the pharmaceuticals business and $15 million related to Health Care severance and other costs. In addition, $112 million of severance and benefit costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to worldwide staff overhead reduction actions taken to streamline the Companys cost structure in response to the sale of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business. The Health Care business is being charged with these overhead costs until such overhead costs are reduced to zero through various restructuring actions. These costs will reduce cash flows in 2007 when the related severance is paid. Health Care also included $95 million of expensed in process research and development costs related to the Brontes acquisition and $13 million in environmental reserves related to the pharmaceuticals business. In 2006, Health Care sales were $4.011 billion. Organic local currency growth was 5.3%, with acquisitions adding an additional 0.7% of growth. Local currency growth was led by the medical supplies and dental businesses. 3Ms pharmaceutical business was approximately 19% of Health Care sales in 2006. Pharmaceutical local currency sales declined 3.5% in 2006, while the remaining businesses 2006 local currency sales growth increased 8.5%. Geographically, Health Cares local currency sales growth in dollars was strongest in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific areas. Operating income for 2006 was up 65.6%, impacted by the gain on sale of our branded pharmaceuticals business, restructuring impacts and other items as discussed in the preceding paragraph, which positively impacted operating income growth by 60.4%. In 2005, Health Care reported local currency sales growth of 4.2%. 3Ms core medical and dental businesses and health information systems businesses experienced local currency sales growth of approximately 6%. The strength of these businesses helped overcome the sales growth challenges of the pharmaceutical business. Sales of certain products within 3Ms pharmaceuticals business, primarily comprised of prescription drugs for inhalation, womens health, and cardiovascular conditions, declined due to price pressure in Europe and decreased demand for some of these older products. Health Care continued to focus on operational efficiency, which helped drive a 14.6% increase in operating income in 2005. Looking ahead, as discussed in the preceding Overview section, the sale of our branded pharmaceuticals business will impact both sales growth and operating income margins in Health Care and the total company in 2007. Sales growth in 2007 will be negatively impacted as significant pharmaceuticals sales will be in the base 2006 period. In addition, Health Care operating income is expected to decline in 2007 by approximately 2 percentage points year on year, negatively impacted by this sale. As a result, 3M believes the following disaggregated information for 3M Health Cares remaining businesses (after the sale of pharmaceuticals) and for pharmaceuticals on a stand alone basis provides useful information. 20 Health Care Business without Pharmaceuticals: 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 3,237 $ 2,963 $ 2,803 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 8.5 % 5.3 % 2.9 % Translation 0.7 0.4 4.2 Total sales change 9.2 % 5.7 % 7.1 % Operating income (millions) $ 806 $ 888 $ 779 Percent change (9.1 )% 14.0 % 12.8 % Percent of sales 24.9 % 30.0 % 27.8 % The following discussion provides information on 3M Health Cares remaining businesses (after the sale of pharmaceuticals). In total, the combination of the following items negatively impacted 2006 fourth quarter and total year operating income by $110 million. Health Care without pharmaceuticals included $95 million of expensed in process research and development costs related to the Brontes acquisition. Business specific restructuring actions totaled $15 million, primarily comprised of severance and related benefits plus asset impairments. In 2006, sales were $3.237 billion. Organic local currency growth was 7.4%, with acquisitions adding an additional 1.1% of growth. Local currency growth was led by the medical supplies and dental businesses. Geographically, local currency sales growth in dollars was strongest in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific areas. Operating income for 2006 decreased 9.1%, impacted by restructuring impacts and other items as discussed in the preceding paragraph, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 12.4%. In 2005, local currency sales growth was 5.3%, led by 3Ms medical, dental and health information systems businesses. Operational efficiency helped drive a 14.0% increase in operating income in 2005. Pharmaceuticals Business: 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 774 $ 797 $ 793 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) (3.5 )% 0.3 % (6.7 )% Translation 0.6 0.3 4.3 Total sales change (2.9 )% 0.6 % (2.4 )% Operating income (millions) $ 1,039 $ 226 $ 194 Percent change N/A 16.6 % (10.5 )% Percent of sales N/A 28.4 % 24.5 % In total, the combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2006 pharmaceuticals operating income by $783 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006. As discussed in Note 2, in early December 2006, the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. The Company also sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the United States, Canada and Latin America in late December 2006. The operating income gain related to these transactions, which is included in pharmaceuticals, totaled $1.074 billion. As discussed in Note 4, $112 million of severance and benefit costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to worldwide staff overhead reduction actions taken to streamline the Companys cost structure in response to the sale of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business. As also discussed in Note 4, the pharmaceuticals business for total year 2006 included $97 million in employee related severance and benefits and $69 million of asset impairments and other expenses. In addition, an environmental reserve of $13 million was recognized related to the pharmaceuticals business. In 2006, pharmaceuticals sales totaled $774 million, a local currency sales decrease of 3.5%. The early December 2006 sale of the branded pharmaceuticals business in the Asia Pacific region negatively impacted total year 2006 sales by approximately 0.6%. In 2005, local currency sales increased slightly. Given the relatively flat sales, operating income dollars and margins have remained at a healthy level, even after considering the impact of net gains related to the sale of branded pharmaceuticals in 2006. 21 Display and Graphics Business (16.4% of consolidated sales): 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 3,765 $ 3,511 $ 3,346 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.9 % 4.7 % 12.4 % Translation 0.3 0.2 4.7 Total sales change 7.2 % 4.9 % 17.1 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,062 $ 1,162 $ 1,115 Percent change (8.6 )% 4.2 % 28.8 % Percent of sales 28.2 % 33.1 % 33.3 % The Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, touch screen, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film and lens solutions for electronic displays; touch screens and touch monitors; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; and commercial graphics systems. The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the display lighting industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors, 2) LCD televisions, 3) hand held devices such as cellular phones, 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. The remaining lifetimes of such patents, as well as patents protecting future products, range from less than a few years to more than 15 years. These patents provide varying measures of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. 3Ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of such patents. In 2006, the Display and Graphics business posted local currency sales growth of 6.9%. Optical film sales volumes increased at double digit rates in 2006. 3M saw an acceleration in the LCD industry due to strong consumer demand for LCD TVs, which drove record sales of 3Ms proprietary optical films, despite ongoing downward pricing pressure in these consumer electronic applications. Commercial Graphics, a supplier of large format graphics solutions that cut across a range of industries, delivered strong double digit local currency growth in 2006. Traffic Safety Systems also posted solid local currency growth. Operating income declined by 8.6%. Operating income included $39 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 3.4%. These asset impairments relate to decisions the Company made in the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit certain marginal product lines in the Touch Systems and Optical Systems businesses. In optical film, selling price declines, the sales mix shift towards larger LCD displays, and operational challenges related to the Companys new optical film manufacturing production line penalized operating income in 2006. In 2005, Display and Graphics local currency sales grew 4.7%, impacted by many factors. The first half of 2005 was tempered by tough year on year optical film comparisons, while 3Ms traffic safety systems business awaited a new highway funding bill in the United States and the sluggish economies in Western Europe and Japan held back growth in the commercial graphics business. Growth rebounded in the second half of 2005 as a new U.S. highway funding bill was passed in July, the economies in Western Europe and Japan started to show some moderate growth and, as expected, 3M saw acceleration in demand for consumer electronics, especially flat panel LCD televisions and a more normal LCD component inventory situation. This growth in the second half of 2005 drove record sales of 3Ms proprietary optical films and components despite growing pricing pressure. The continued decline in lens systems for the CRT rear projection television market negatively impacted Display and Graphics sales growth by approximately 3% in 2005 and negatively impacted operating income by approximately 7.5% in 2005. 22 Consumer and Office Business (14.1% of consolidated sales): 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 3,238 $ 3,033 $ 2,901 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.1 % 3.6 % 7.1 % Translation 0.7 1.0 2.8 Total sales change 6.8 % 4.6 % 9.9 % Operating income (millions) $ 579 $ 561 $ 514 Percent change 3.2 % 9.1 % 17.3 % Percent of sales 17.9 % 18.5 % 17.7 % The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, education, and home improvement. Products provided to these and other markets include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products, home care products, protective material products (including consumer health care products such as bandages), and visual systems products. In 2006, Consumer and Office local currency sales growth of 6.1% was broad based across the portfolio, led by the construction and home improvement division, which serves the do it yourself retail channel. 3M also posted very good sales growth in the mass retail channel. 3M continues to penetrate large key accounts, primarily in the United States, with an array of unique, highly functional products featuring customer inspired designs. Operating income was $579 million, up 3.2% year on year. 3M experienced slower sales growth in the construction and home improvement market in the fourth quarter of 2006, impacted by a housing slowdown in the United States that is expected to continue into 2007. 3Ms visual systems business, which traditionally has offered analog overhead and electronic projectors and film, continued to experience a decline and reduced overall Consumer and Office sales growth by approximately 1% for the year. In 2005, Consumer and Office local currency sales increased 3.6%, with broad based growth across the many channels 3M serves. Consumer and Office experienced solid local currency sales growth in construction and home improvement, home care and in its protective materials businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2005, sales were up slightly in local currency terms compared with the exceptional fourth quarter of 2004, when local currency sales increased 8.3%, as several large retailers apparently increased their purchase rate level to meet their objectives. The continuing decline in 3Ms Visual Systems business impacted sales by approximately 2% for the year. Consumer and Office continues to drive success by combining unique functionality and customer inspired design in new and mature products such as Scotch Tape, Post It Notes, Filtrete Filters and O Cel O sponges. Operating income increased 9.1% in 2005. Safety, Security and Protection Services Business (11.4% of consolidated sales): 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 2,621 $ 2,292 $ 2,125 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 13.2 % 6.9 % 6.6 % Translation 1.2 1.0 3.6 Total sales change 14.4 % 7.9 % 10.2 % Operating income (millions) $ 575 $ 537 $ 465 Percent change 7.0 % 15.4 % 11.9 % Percent of sales 21.9 % 23.4 % 21.9 % The Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that strive to increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, safety and security products, energy control products, cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles. In August 2006, 3M completed the acquisition of Security Printing and Systems Limited, a producer of finished, personalized passports and secure cards, which expands the 3M product line related to border and civil security solutions. 23 In 2006, local currency growth in the Safety, Security and Protection Services business was up 13.2% to $2.621 billion. Growth in the business continues to be driven by strong global demand for personal safety products, especially respiratory protection. Acquisitions contributed 4.0% of growth, primarily due to the Security Printing and Systems Limited acquisition in August 2006. 3M continues to invest in additional respirator capacity, such as a new respirator manufacturing facility in Korea, which will serve the Asia Pacific region. 3M also posted outstanding growth in the corrosion protection division, a smaller but growing business, which supplies coatings for all types of commercial and industrial applications in a variety of industries. 3Ms roofing granules business experienced a challenging fourth quarter, with a sales decline of nearly 50%, resulting in sales in this business declining nearly 10% when comparing total year 2006 with 2005. Geographically, local currency growth was positive across all regions of the world, led by Europe and the United States. Operating income increased 7.0% to $575 million in 2006. Operating income includes $10 million in restructuring expenses, primarily severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.9%. In 2005, Safety, Security and Protection Services local currency sales growth was 6.9%, driven by broad based growth across the business portfolio and geographies. The continued global threat posed by terrorism, natural disasters, SARS and Avian flu helped raise the awareness in the general public about the importance of personal protective equipment, especially respiratory protection for overall health. Sales growth was driven by continued strong global demand for personal protection products and solutions, particularly respiratory protection products, along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products for commercial buildings. Roofing granules for asphalt shingles also showed solid sales growth. Operating income improved 15.4% in 2005. Electro and Communications Business (10.8% of consolidated sales): 2006 2005 2004 Sales (millions) $ 2,483 $ 2,333 $ 2,224 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 5.6 % 4.2 % 2.7 % Translation 0.8 0.7 3.1 Total sales change 6.4 % 4.9 % 5.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 438 $ 447 $ 316 Percent change (2.1 )% 41.5 % 18.6 % Percent of sales 17.6 % 19.2 % 14.2 % The Electro and Communications segment serves the electrical, electronics and communications industries, including electrical utilities; electrical construction, maintenance and repair; OEM electrical and electronics; computers and peripherals; consumer electronics; telecommunications central office, outside plant and enterprise; as well as aerospace, military, automotive and medical markets. This segment provides products that enable the efficient transmission of electrical power and speed the delivery of information and ideas. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, microinterconnect systems, high performance fluids, high temperature and display tapes, telecommunications products and electrical products. In 2006, the Electro and Communications business posted sales of $2.483 billion. Organic local currency growth for 2006 of 4.2% was attributable to the electrical and electronics markets. Acquisitions contributed 1.4% to sales growth. 3M generated good top line growth in its electrical markets division, which sells a number of insulating, testing and connecting products and solutions to both power utilities and manufacturing OEMs. 3M also continues to see good growth from its electronics markets business, driven by double digit growth in its semi conductor and assemblies business. Partially offsetting this was some sales softness in our U.S. communications markets business due to higher copper costs. Operating income declined by 2.1% to $438 million. Operating income includes $46 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 10.3%. Operating margins continue to be impacted by rising raw material costs, specifically copper costs, in our electrical and telecommunications markets businesses. In 2005, local currency sales in Electro and Communications increased 4.2%, with improving end market conditions and success in developing new applications for existing products into new applications helping the business post its best local currency growth since 2000. Local currency growth accelerated in the second half of 2005, with local currency growth in the fourth quarter of 2005 up 10.9%. Local currency growth was led by demand for 3M electronic products from semiconductor manufacturers, along with continued strong growth in electrical products used for insulating, testing and sensing. This strong sales growth helped offset weakness in the electronic solutions and communications markets. Operating margins were 19.2% in 2005, with operating income increasing 41.5% in 2005. 24 PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18. A summary of key information and discussion related to 3Ms geographic areas follow: Geographic Area 2006 2006 vs. 2005 % Change Net Sales and Total Operating Income % of Oper. Local Trans Sales Oper. (Dollars in millions) Sales Total Income Currency lation Change Income United States $ 8,853 38.6 % $ 1,908 7.1 % 7.1 % 59.0 % Asia Pacific 6,251 27.3 % 2,097 9.2 % (0.4 )% 8.8 % 0.6 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 5,726 25.0 % 1,092 8.3 % 1.4 % 9.7 % 3.3 % Latin America and Canada 2,080 9.1 % 629 6.1 % 4.4 % 10.5 % 22.7 % Other Unallocated 13 (30 ) Total Company $ 22,923 100 % $ 5,696 7.7 % 0.6 % 8.3 % 17.3 % While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3Ms results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end user consumption in that geographic area. U.S. sales revenue increased 7.1%, as all six business segments contributed to this increase. Asia Pacific local currency sales (which exclude translation impacts) increased 9.2%. All six business segments contributed to this increase in the Asia Pacific area, with optical film being the largest growth component. Sales in Japan totaled approximately $2 billion, with local currency sales up 1.5% from 2005. European local currency sales increased 8.3%, with good growth in Industrial and Transportation and Safety, Security and Protection Services. In the combined Latin America and Canada area, local currency sales increases of 6.1% were led by Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services and Consumer and Office. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the combined Latin America and Canada area sales by 4.4%, and the European area sales by 1.4%, as the U.S. dollar weakened against these currencies. Foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on Asia Pacific sales. For 2006, international operations represented 61.4% of 3Ms sales. Since 3M sold its global branded pharmaceuticals business in December 2006 and January 2007, both sales growth and operating income will be negatively impacted in 2007. Sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals totaled $332 million in the United States, $315 million in the Europe, Middle East and Africa area, $77 million in the Asia Pacific area, and $50 million in the Latin America and Canada area. The gain on sale, restructuring and other items in 2006, as discussed in the preceding overview section, increased worldwide operating income by $523 million, with the largest impact in the United States. Geographic Area Supplemental Information Employees as of Capital Property, Plant and (Millions, except December 31 Spending Equipment net employees) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 United States 34,553 33,033 32,648 $ 692 $ 532 $ 565 $ 3,382 $ 3,291 $ 3,290 Asia Pacific 12,487 11,574 10,439 252 228 182 959 865 810 Europe, Middle East and Africa 17,416 16,722 16,574 134 120 143 1,162 1,076 1,288 Latin America and Canada 10,877 9,898 8,583 90 63 47 404 361 323 Total Company 75,333 71,227 68,244 $ 1,168 $ 943 $ 937 $ 5,907 $ 5,593 $ 5,711 Employment: Employment increased by approximately 4,100 people since year end 2005, partially due to acquisitions, with more than 750 people added by our three largest 2006 acquisitions alone. In addition, 3M has increased employees in faster growing areas of the world, such as Brazil, India, Russia, China and Poland, where on a local currency basis sales increased more 25 than 20% in 2006. The increase in 2005 compared with 2004 of approximately 3,000 people was primarily attributable to the August 2005 acquisition of CUNO, which added approximately 2,300 employees. Employment increases at a manufacturing plant in Latin America also contributed to increases of approximately 600 people and 700 people in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales per employee in local currencies increased 7.7% in 2006, approximately 3% in 2005 and approximately 7% in 2004. Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: The bulk of 3M capital spending historically has been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the United States. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because more than 60% of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements. Capital expenditures are expected to increase from this $1.168 billion in 2006 to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2007. The majority of this spending is aimed directly at accelerating top line growth in many of our core businesses. 3M has about 15 significant plant construction projects under way, some adding to existing facilities and a few of the greenfield variety. Internationally, 3M is building respiratory protection capacity in Russia and Korea, medical products capacity in China, an LCD plant in Poland, abrasives and tape capacity in China and India, and chemical facilities in China, just to name a few. This is backed up by similar investments in the U.S. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Companys pension and postretirement obligations, and asset impairments. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors. Legal Proceedings: The categories of claims for which the Company has estimated its probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled Accrued Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Legal Proceedings in Note 13) for additional information about such estimates. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost, and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), which was issued in September 2006 and effective as of December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 158, the Company recognized an after tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.187 billion and $513 million for the U.S. and International pension benefit plans, respectively, and $218 million for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan. Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. The assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at 26 rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high, investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.75% to be appropriate as of December 31, 2006, which is an increase of 0.25 of a percentage point from the rate used as of December 31, 2005. A significant element in determining the Companys pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.75% for 2006 and will remain at 8.75% for 2007. Refer to Note 11 for information on how this rate is determined. As of December 31, 2005, the Company converted to the RP (Retirement Plans) 2000 Mortality Table for calculating the year end 2005 U.S. pension and postretirement obligations and 2006 expense. The impact of this change increased the year end 2005 U.S. Projected Benefit Obligations for pension by $385 million, the year end 2005 U.S. Accumulated Benefit Obligations for pension by $349 million and the 2005 U.S. Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation by $93 million. This change also increased pension expenses for 2006 by $64 million and postretirement expenses by $17 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $347 million, up from $331 million in 2005. Pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to decrease to approximately $174 million in 2007. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase U.S. 2007 pension expense by approximately $24 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $9 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase 2006 pension expense by approximately $32 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $17 million for international pension plans. See Note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation. Asset Impairments: 3M net property, plant and equipment totaled $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2006. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business. In exiting this business, the Company incurred $61 million of asset impairments for this business as assets that were not sold with the transactions did not have future value to the Company. During the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company also decided to exit certain product lines, resulting in fixed and intangible asset impairment costs of $83 million. The fair value of the assets impacted by these product exits was determined based on discounted cash flows. See Note 4 for further details of the 2006 restructuring actions. 3M goodwill totaled approximately $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2006, which, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. The majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. This Interpretation is effective as of January 1, 2007 and the cumulative effects, if any, of applying this Interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on 3Ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 27 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Refer to Note 11 for additional information concerning this standard. Additional information regarding other accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow. Net debt increased slightly in 2006, primarily related to increased short term debt supporting share repurchase activities and acquisitions. The increase in 2005 primarily related to the $1.36 billion CUNO acquisition. At December 31 (Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total Debt $ 3,553 $ 2,381 $ 2,821 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 2,084 1,072 2,757 Net Debt $ 1,469 $ 1,309 $ 64 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006, were higher compared with December 31, 2005, due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in December 2006. 3M believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures. The Company has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service. The Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). The Companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $1.623 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $1.877 billion at December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily related to an increase in debt classified as short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt, partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and inventories. The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivables, inventory and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.4 at December 31, 2006, down from 5.7 at December 31, 2005. Receivables increased $264 million, or 9.3%, compared with December 31, 2005. Currency translation (due to the stronger U.S. dollar) increased accounts receivable by $113 million year on year. Inventories increased $439 million, or 20.3%, compared with December 31, 2005. Currency translation increased inventories by $92 million year on year. Accounts payable increased $146 million compared with December 31, 2005, with $53 million of this year on year increase related to currency translation. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. 28 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 3,851 $ 3,111 $ 2,841 Depreciation and amortization 1,079 986 999 Company pension contributions (348 ) (654 ) (591 ) Company postretirement contributions (37 ) (134 ) (168 ) Company pension expense 347 331 325 Company postretirement expense 93 106 110 Stock based compensation expense 200 155 252 Gain from sale of pharmaceuticals business (1,074 ) Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) (178 ) 402 326 Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (60 ) (54 ) (54 ) Accounts receivable (103 ) (184 ) 56 Inventories (309 ) (294 ) 7 Accounts payable 68 113 35 Product and other insurance receivables and claims 58 122 12 Other net 252 198 78 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,839 $ 4,204 $ 4,228 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $365 million. This decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005. The higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the Companys repatriation of $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the United States pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The category Other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including outstanding liabilities at December 31, 2006, related to 3Ms restructuring actions (Note 4). In 2005, cash flow was essentially flat when compared with 2004. Higher net income, higher accounts payable and increased insurance receivable collections were offset by accounts receivable increases, inventory increases and other items. Product and other insurance receivables and claims increased cash flow by $122 million in 2005, benefiting from the $148 million in insurance recoveries for the breast implant matter in 2005. The category Other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts. For example, in 2005, this category includes the non cash impact of adopting FIN 47 ($35 million cumulative effect of accounting change), increases in accrued liabilities (such as the $30 million increase in liability related to legal settlement agreements), and other items. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling $200 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan. In 2005, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling $500 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan, with $200 million contributed in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $300 million contributed in the third quarter of 2005. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company made a special pension contribution to 3Ms Japanese pension plan of $155 million and a discretionary contribution of $300 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $ (1,168 ) $ (943 ) $ (937 ) Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets 49 41 69 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (888 ) (1,293 ) (73 ) Proceeds from sale of pharmaceuticals business 1,209 Purchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments net (662 ) (46 ) 3 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,460 ) $ (2,241 ) $ (938 ) 29 Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital expenditures were $1.168 billion in 2006, an increase of $225 million compared with 2005, as 3M invested in a number of growing and highly profitable businesses such as medical, respiratory protection, LCD films and others. The Company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2007. Refer to the preceding Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment section for more detail. Refer to Note 2 for information on 2006, 2005 and 2004 acquisitions. Note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments in 2006 and 2005 are primarily attributable to auction rate and asset backed securities, which are classified as available for sale. 2006 includes purchases, net of sales and maturities, of $637 million for marketable securities. Prior to 2005, purchases of and proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities were classified as Cash and Cash Equivalents. At December 31, 2004, the amount of such securities taken as a whole was immaterial to Cash and Cash Equivalents, and accordingly was not reclassified for 2004 and prior. Purchases of investments in 2005 include the purchase of 19% of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (discussed previously under the Industrial and Transportation business segment). The purchase price of approximately $55 million is reported as Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and as Purchases of marketable securities and investments in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Change in short term debt net $ 882 $ (258 ) $ 399 Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (440 ) (656 ) (868 ) Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 693 429 358 Total change in debt $ 1,135 $ (485 ) $ (111 ) Purchases of treasury stock (2,351 ) (2,377 ) (1,791 ) Reissuances of treasury stock 523 545 508 Dividends paid to stockholders (1,376 ) (1,286 ) (1,125 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 60 54 54 Distributions to minority interests and other net (52 ) (76 ) (15 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,061 ) $ (3,625 ) $ (2,480 ) Total debt at December 31, 2006, was $3.553 billion, up from $2.381 billion at year end 2005, with the increase primarily attributable to commercial paper issuances and the November 2006 issuance of a three year, $400 million, medium term note. In 2006, the increase in net short term debt of $882 million includes the portion of short term debt with original maturities of 90 days or less, which primarily represents commercial paper activity. The repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days also primarily relates to commercial paper activity. Total debt was 26% of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity), compared with 19% at year end 2005. Debt securities, including the Companys shelf registration, its medium term notes program, dealer remarketable securities and Convertible Note, are all discussed in more detail in Note 10. 3M has a shelf registration and medium term notes program through which $1.5 billion of medium term notes may be offered. In November 2006, the Company issued $400 million under its medium term notes program. In 2004, the Company issued approximately $62 million in debt securities under this program. The medium term notes program and shelf registration have remaining capacity of approximately $1.038 billion. The Companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (classified as current portion of long term debt) were remarketed for one year in December 2006. In addition, the Company has Convertible Notes with a book value of $542 million at December 31, 2006. The next put option date for these Convertible Notes is November 2007. At December 31, 2006, the Convertible Notes, dealer remarketable securities, $62 million of medium term notes, and $71 million of floating rate notes are classified as current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. For a discussion of accounting pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the Convertible Note, refer to Note 1 for discussion of EITF 30 Issue No. 04 08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share and proposed SFAS No. 128R, Earnings per Share. Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. On February 13, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of $2.0 billion of the Companys common stock between February 13, 2006 and February 28, 2007. On August 15, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, raising the total authorization to $3 billion for the period from February 13, 2006 to February 28, 2007. As of December 31, 2006, $748 million remained available for repurchase. Refer to the table captioned Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5, for more information. Cash dividends paid to stockholders totaled $1.376 billion ($1.84 per share) in 2006, $1.286 billion ($1.68 per share) in 2005 and $1.125 billion ($1.44 per share) in 2004. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. Other cash flows from financing activities include distributions to minority interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. Liquidity: The Companys liquidity remains strong. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006, were higher when compared with December 31, 2005, due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in December 2006. Primary short term liquidity needs are provided through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2006, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $1.349 billion and averaged approximately $1.080 billion during 2006. Medium term note shelf borrowing capacity totaled $1.038 billion as of December 31, 2006. Credit support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a $565 million credit agreement among a group of primary relationship banks. In March 2005, the Company replaced its 364 day credit agreement with a five year credit agreement with similar terms. This $565 million credit facility provides up to $115 million in letters of credit ($98 million of which was utilized at December 31, 2006), with provisions for increasing this limit up to $150 million. Committed credit facilities of $55 million are in place across several international subsidiary locations ($9 million of which was utilized at December 31, 2006). To benefit from the SEC Securities Offering Reform rules applicable to well known seasoned issuers, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC on February 24, 2006, which became effective automatically, to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. No securities were issued off this shelf. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. The Company believes it unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations, if necessary. At December 31, 2006, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable securities and $127 million of ESOP debt) had ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. The Company currently has AA/Aa1 debt ratings. In addition, the $565 million, five year credit agreement requires 3M to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 0.60 to 1 at the end of each quarter. This ratio is calculated as funded debt (including all borrowed money and letters of credit utilized) to the sum of funded debt and equity. At December 31, 2006, this ratio was approximately 0.27 to 1. 3Ms cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2006 totaled $1.447 billion, with an additional $637 million in current and long term marketable securities. 3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.376 billion in 2006, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2007, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 4.3% to 48 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.92 per share. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors also authorized a $7 billion two year share repurchase authorization for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. In 2007, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $400 million to its U.S. and international pension plans. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2007. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. plans funding status as of the 2007 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: As of December 31, 2006, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements. 3Ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long term liabilities are estimated at approximately $25 million. 3M does not consider this amount to be material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material. 31 In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require 3M to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property. While 3Ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006, follows: Contractual Obligations Payments due by year After (Millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2011 Long term debt, including current portion (Note 10) $ 2,161 $ 1,114 $ 89 $ 444 $ $ $ 514 Interest on long term debt 780 85 37 37 28 28 565 Operating leases (Note 13) 359 85 65 50 26 19 114 Capital leases (Note 13) 79 6 6 5 5 5 52 Unconditional purchase obligations 396 162 110 84 11 8 21 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,775 $ 1,452 $ 307 $ 620 $ 70 $ 60 $ 1,266 Long term debt payments due in 2007 include $542 million of Convertible Notes (final maturity 2032), $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity 2010), $62 million of medium term notes (final maturity 2044) $42 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2037), and $29 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2027). These securities are classified as the current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis. As discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2007. Thus, Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2007 and future years. Contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending in 2007 and beyond. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. 32 A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the Companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2006. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. The model used analyzed seventeen currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures.
