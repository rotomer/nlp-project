Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3Ms financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3Ms MD&A is presented in nine sections: Reference (pages) Overview 12 Results of Operations 15 Performance by Business Segment 18 Performance by Geographic Segment 27 Critical Accounting Estimates 28 New Accounting Pronouncements 30 Financial Condition and Liquidity 30 Financial Instruments 35 Forward Looking Statements 35 OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. 3M manages its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Electro and Communications. 3Ms strategy continues to emphasize a commitment to grow at a faster pace, using a four pronged approach, which includes reinvesting in its core businesses, developing adjacent emerging business opportunities, expanding on the Companys already world class capabilities internationally, and acquiring companies in complementary faster growing industries. The Company will continue to invest in research and development and plant start ups in 2008, including investments in emerging markets around the world. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.368 billion in 2007. Capital expenditures totaled $1.422 billion in 2007, up $254 million compared with 2006. The Company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2008, providing the capacity to meet expected growth. In December 2006 and January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business, resulting in gains in the fourth quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007. In addition, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses in the second quarter of 2007. In both 2007 and 2006, these gains on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate were partially offset by restructuring and other items. Refer to Note A at the end of this overview section for additional details. Including these items, in 2007, 3M reported record net sales of $24.462 billion and record net income of $4.096 billion, or $5.60 per diluted share, compared with net sales of $22.923 billion and net income of $3.851 billion, or $5.06 per diluted share, in 2006. Excluding the items in Note A in both years, the Company still achieved strong underlying operating performance, helped by a 6.7% increase in net sales, which included the divestiture impacts discussed above that reduced sales growth by 3.8%. The following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for discussion of the gain on sale of businesses, restructuring and other items that impacted reported operating income results. 2007 2006 2007 vs. 2006 % change (Dollars in millions) Net Sales % of Total Oper.

Local currency sales growth (which includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes divestiture and translation impacts) was 7.3%, with organic local currency growth of 4.9% (including 0.7% benefit from pharmaceuticals supply agreements) and acquisitions adding 2.4%. Divestitures, primarily the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business (Health Care segment), decreased worldwide sales growth by 3.8%. The sale of the pharmaceuticals business is not presented as a discontinued operation due to the extent of the projected continuing cash flows from 3Ms contractual supply relationship with the buyers in relation to those of the business that was sold. The breadth of 3Ms product lines was evident during 2007 as the Company experienced solid sales growth across the portfolio. Health Care led all segments with local currency sales growth of 18.3% (excluding divestitures). This includes a 4.4% benefit from acquisitions and 4.5% benefit due to the pharmaceuticals supply agreements. The sale of 3Ms global branded pharmaceuticals business reduced Health Care sales growth by 23.7%. Local currency sales increased 10.8% in Safety, Security and Protection Services, including 7.4% from numerous acquisitions. Local currency sales increased 5.8% in Industrial and Transportation, 5.0% in Consumer and Office, 2.3% in Electro and Communications, and 1.8% (excluding the impact of the Opticom/Canoga divestiture) in Display and Graphics. While 3M experienced broad based sales growth, there was softness in certain markets in 2007. Within Display and Graphics, optical film sales increased slightly year on year, but 3M experienced an attachment rate loss in LCD desktop monitors and LCD TV segments, particularly in the second half of 2007, as competition continued to intensify in this market. 3M also experienced weakness in its roofing granules business for residential asphalt shingles and in its electronic solutions business due to softness in certain segments of the consumer electronics market. Refer to the section entitled Performance by Business Segment for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments. Geographically, the European region (which includes Europe, Middle East and Africa) led local currency sales growth in 2007, with an increase of 11.7%, 7.4% of which was organic (excluding acquisitions, divestiture and translation impacts). Sales growth in Europe was led by Safety, Security and Protection Services and Health Care (without Pharmaceuticals). The combined Latin America and Canada area local currency sales increased 10.6%, of which 9.6% was organic, with growth led by Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services and Health Care (without Pharmaceuticals). Asia Pacific local currency sales increased 4.9%, of which 4.5% was organic, with all six business segments contributing to this increase. United States local currency sales increased 5.7%, of which 2.6% was organic. Organic volume growth in the U.S. was led by Health Care (without Pharmaceuticals) and Industrial and Transportation, which was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the U.S. housing, road construction and mass retail markets, primarily the roofing granules, protective materials, traffic safety and office supply businesses. Divestitures, primarily the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business, reduced sales in Europe by 6.6%, in the United States by 4.2%, in the combined Latin America and Canada area by 2.8%, and in Asia Pacific by 1.3%. Currency effects increased total international sales by 5.2%, with Europe positively impacted by 8.5%, the combined Latin America and Canada area by 5.9%, and Asia Pacific by 2.0%, as the U.S. dollar weakened in aggregate against the multitude of currencies in these geographic areas. Operating income for 2007 increased 8.7% year on year, including a net 2.2 percentage point benefit from the impact of items discussed in Note A below. Operating income margins were approximately 25% in both 2007 and 2006, with items in Note A positively impacting these margins in both years by approximately 2.5 percentage points. 3M generated $4.275 billion of operating cash flows in 2007, an increase of $436 million compared to 2006. In 2007, the Company utilized $4.619 billion of cash to repurchase 3M common stock and pay dividends, compared to $3.727 billion in 2006. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $4.1 billion remained available for repurchase. In February 2008, 3Ms Board authorized a dividend increase of 4.2% for 2008, marking the 50th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3Ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) as of December 31, 2007 was 30%. 3M has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors, with a stable outlook, and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service, with a negative outlook. The Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. In 2007, the Company experienced cost increases affecting metals, wood pulp and oil derived raw materials. Costs for these materials have remained high throughout the year, and 3M would expect this level to carry over into early 2008, with some moderation occurring later in the year. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. 13 In 2007, the Company modified elements of its long term incentive compensation programs. With the May 2007 Management Stock Ownership Program (MSOP) Annual Grant, the Company reduced the number of traditional stock options granted by reducing the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units. These changes will reduce the annual dilution impact from approximately 1.5% of total outstanding common stock to approximately 1%. However, associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees, the Company provided a one time buyout grant of restricted stock units to the impacted employees, which resulted in increased stock based compensation expense in 2007. Stock based compensation expense totaled $0.18 per diluted share in 2007, compared with $0.17 per diluted share in 2006. The Companys MSOP, including restricted stock units, is discussed further in Note 15. The preceding forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward looking statements section in Item 7 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). (Note A). In 2007, gains on sale of businesses and real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased operating income by $681 million and net income by $448 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. 2007 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of businesses ($849 million pre tax, $550 million after tax) and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million pre tax, $37 million after tax), which were partially offset by increases in environmental liabilities ($134 million pre tax, $83 million after tax), restructuring actions ($41 million pre tax, $27 million after tax), and other exit activities ($45 million pre tax, $29 million after tax). These items, except the gain on sale of real estate, are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures), Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Other Exit Activities) and Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies). Gains on sale of businesses include the second quarter 2007 sale of 3Ms Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses, and the first quarter 2007 sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. Concerning the real estate sale, 3M sold its current lab facility located in Suwon, Korea and is currently building a new state of the art customer oriented R&D facility closer to Seoul and many of 3Ms major customers. In 2006, gains of sale of businesses, net of restructuring and other items, increased operating income by $523 million and net income by $438 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre tax, $674 million after tax) and favorable income tax adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by restructuring actions ($403 million pre tax, $257 million after tax), acquired in process research and development expenses ($95 million pre tax and after tax), settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($40 million pre tax, $25 million after tax), and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million pre tax, $8 million after tax). These items, except the settlement costs and environmental obligations, are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures), Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Other Exit Activities), Note 8 (Income Taxes) and Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies). Concerning settlement costs, the Company recorded $40 million in 2006 with respect to a settlement in principle related to the antitrust class action brought on behalf of direct purchasers who did not purchase private label tape. Concerning environmental obligations, the Company increased its reserves by $13 million during 2006 for estimated environmental remediation costs at a European pharmaceutical plant. 14 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales: 2007 2006 U.S. Intl.

All business segments have contributed positive local currency sales growth for four consecutive years. Acquisitions increased 2007 sales by 2.4%, led by the August 2006 acquisition of Security Printing and Systems Limited and the late 2006 acquisitions of Softmed Systems Inc. and Biotrace International PLC. In 2006, local currency sales growth of 7.7% was broad based, as all business segments made positive contributions to local currency sales growth. Acquisitions increased 2006 sales by 2.1%, driven by the August 2005 acquisition of CUNO and the August 2006 acquisition of Security Printing and Systems Limited. Refer to both the Performance by Business Segment and Performance by Geographic Area sections for additional discussion of sales change. Operating Expenses: 2007 Versus 2006 Versus (Percent of net sales) 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Cost of sales 52.1 % 51.1 % 49.2 % 1.0 % 1.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 20.5 22.1 21.9 (1.6 ) 0.2 Research, development and related expenses 5.6 6.6 6.0 (1.0 ) 0.6 Gain on sale of businesses (3.5 ) (4.6 ) 1.1 (4.6 ) Operating income 25.3 % 24.8 % 22.9 % 0.5 % 1.9 % As discussed in the preceding overview section, the 2007 gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of environmental liability charges, restructuring and other exit activities, benefited 2007 operating income by $681 million, or 2.8% of net sales. In addition, the 2006 gain on sale, net of restructuring and other items, benefited 2006 operating income by $523 million, or 2.2% of net sales. The following tables summarize these items by operating expense category. Items included in the Other category of the table for 2006 are acquired in process research and development expenses ($95 million), settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($40 million), and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million). 15 2007 Gain on Sale, Restructuring and Other Summary (Millions) Gain on Sale of businesses Environ mental liabilities Restructuring and other exit activities Gain on sale of real estate Total Cost of sales $ $ $ 64 $ $ 64 Selling, general and administrative expenses 134 26 (52 ) 108 Research, development and related expenses (4 ) (4 ) Gain on sale of businesses (849 ) (849 ) Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ (849 ) $ 134 $ 86 $ (52 ) $ (681 ) 2006 Gain on Sale, Restructuring and Other Summary (Millions) Gain on sale of pharma ceuticals business Pharma ceuticals restructuring actions Overhead reduction actions Business specific actions Total restruc turing actions Other Total Cost of sales $ $ 32 $ 24 $ 74 $ 130 $ 13 $ 143 Selling, general and administrative expenses 66 81 51 198 40 238 Research, development and related expenses 68 7 75 95 170 Gain on sale of businesses (1,074 ) (1,074 ) Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ (1,074 ) $ 166 $ 112 $ 125 $ 403 $ 148 $ (523 ) Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased 1.0 percentage point in 2007 compared to 2006, with this increase primarily due to the sale of the branded pharmaceuticals business, which had lower than average cost of sales. Raw material costs increased approximately 1% in 2007, compared with 2006. In 2007, restructuring and other exit costs increased cost of sales by $64 million, or 0.3 percentage points. These charges primarily related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit manufacturing operations, the phase out of operations at the Companys New Jersey roofing granule facility and charges related to the Companys decision to close an Electro and Communications facility in Wisconsin. In 2006, restructuring and other items increased cost of sales by $143 million, or 0.7 percentage points. Cost of sales increased 1.9 percentage points in 2006. Approximately 1.2 percentage points of this increase related to numerous items, such as higher raw material costs, slightly lower selling prices, and higher costs associated with scaling up additional manufacturing capacity. In addition, there were supply chain inefficiencies caused by capacity constraints. Finally, 3M accelerated the pace of acquisitions in 2006, which increased cost of sales slightly for the year. Broad based sales volume growth and productivity gains helped offset some of this impact. Raw material costs increased approximately 3% for 2006, compared with 2005. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2007 when compared to 2006, as expenses incurred in 2006 in the Companys now divested global branded Pharmaceuticals business did not repeat in 2007. Non pharmaceutical ongoing SG&A expenses, after adjusting for the following items, were up approximately 7% in dollars, reflecting the Companys continued investment in sales and marketing to support growth markets. In 2007, SG&A includes increases in environmental liabilities, restructuring charges and other exit activities, net of the gain on sale of real estate ($108 million combined net expense), which increased SG&A as a percent of sales by 0.4 percentage points. 2006 included restructuring actions and settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($238 million combined expense), which increased 2006 SG&A as a percent of sales by 1.0 percentage points. In dollars, SG&A decreased $51 million when comparing 2007 to 2006, with the change in restructuring and other items year on year decreasing SG&A by $130 million, pharmaceutical SG&A spending decreasing $241 million and other SG&A spending increasing $320 million, or approximately 7% in dollars. The Company continues to constrain administrative costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.2 of a percentage point in 2006 when compared to 2005. In dollars, SG&A increased $435 million, with restructuring and other items increasing SG&A by $238 million and other spending increasing SG&A by $197 million. 3M continues to invest in growth oriented SG&A as sales and marketing costs increased faster than sales, while administrative expenses remained relatively flat in dollars, attributable to ongoing cost control efforts. 16 Research, Development and Related Expenses: Research, development and related expenses (R&D) as a percent of net sales decreased 1.0 percentage point in 2007 when compared to 2006, as expenses incurred in 2006 in the Companys now divested R&D intensive Pharmaceuticals business did not repeat in 2007. Non pharmaceutical ongoing R&D expenses, after adjusting for the following items, were up approximately 11% in dollars, as the Company continued to aggressively invest in future technologies and growth opportunities. 2006 spending included a $95 million in process research and development charge (discussed in Note 2) and $75 million in restructuring actions (Note 4), which increased 2006 R&D as a percent of sales by 0.7 percentage points. In dollars, R&D spending decreased $154 million when comparing 2007 to 2006, with the change in restructuring and other items year on year decreasing R&D by $174 million, 2006 pharmaceutical SG&A spending decreasing $120 million and other R&D spending increasing $140 million, or approximately 11% in dollars, reflecting 3Ms continuing commitment to fund future growth for the Company. R&D increased as a percent of sales by 0.6 of a percentage point, or $248 million, when comparing 2006 to 2005. The 2006 spending included a $95 million in process research and development charge (discussed in Note 2) and $75 million in restructuring actions (Note 4). Other spending increased approximately $78 million, representing an increase of approximately 6% compared with 2005. Gain on Sale of Businesses: In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe to Meda AB. 3M received proceeds of $817 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, a pre tax gain of $781 million in 2007 (recorded in the Health Care segment). In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses to TorQuest Partners Inc., a Toronto based investment firm. 3M received proceeds of $80 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre tax gain of $68 million (recorded in the Display and Graphics segment) in 2007. In December 2006, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals businesses in the United States, Canada, and Latin America region and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. 3M received proceeds of $1.209 billion for these transactions and recognized a pre tax gain on sale of $1.074 billion in 2006 (recorded in the Health Care segment). For more detail, refer to Note 2. Operating Income: 3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income margins over the past several years have been in excess of 22%, helped by solid sales growth and an ongoing strong commitment to maintaining operational discipline throughout 3Ms global operations. Operating income margins of 25.3% in 2007 were positively impacted by 2.8 percentage points ($681 million) from the gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of environmental liabilities, restructuring and other exit activities. Operating income margins of 24.8% for 2006 were positively impacted by 2.2 percentage points ($523 million) from the gain on sale of portions of the pharmaceuticals business, net of restructuring and other actions. Adjusting for the preceding items, operating income margins in 2007 were similar to 2006. Interest Expense and Income: (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ 210 $ 122 $ 82 Interest income (132 ) (51 ) (56 ) Total $ 78 $ 71 $ 26 Interest Expense: Interest expense increased year on year in both 2007 and 2006, primarily due to higher average debt balances and higher interest rates. Interest Income: Interest income increased in 2007 due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates. Interest income was lower in 2006, with lower average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances partially offset by higher interest rates. 17 Provision for Income Taxes: (Percent of pre tax income) 2007 2006 2005 Effective tax rate 32.1 % 30.6 % 33.7 % The effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.1%, compared with 30.6% in 2006. The Companys 2007 tax rate benefited from reduced international tax rates and an increased benefit for the domestic manufacturers deduction, but was penalized by the elimination of the foreign export sales benefit. The Companys 2006 tax rate included benefits from adjustments to its reserves for tax contingencies following the settlement of income tax audits. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. The tax rate for 2006 was 30.6%, compared with 33.7% in 2005. As discussed above, the Companys 2006 tax rate included benefits from adjustments to its reserves for tax contingencies. In 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act). The Jobs Act provided 3M the opportunity to tax effectively repatriate foreign earnings for U.S. qualifying investments specified by 3Ms domestic reinvestment plan. As a consequence, in the second quarter of 2005, 3M recorded a tax expense of $75 million, net of available foreign tax credits, which negatively impacted the 2005 effective worldwide tax rate by 1.6%. No similar repatriation occurred in 2006 since this Jobs Act provision only applied to 2005. Minority Interest: (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Minority interest $ 55 $ 51 $ 55 Minority interest expense eliminates the income or loss attributable to non 3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. 3Ms most significant consolidated entity with non 3M ownership interests is Sumitomo 3M Limited in Japan (3M owns 75% of Sumitomo 3M Limited). Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change: As of December 31, 2005, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). This accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and where the liability can be reasonably estimated. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the Companys long term assets. The fair value of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59 million at December 31, 2005 and an after tax charge of $35 million for 2005, which was reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Income. At December 31, 2007, the asset retirement obligation liability was $59 million. Currency Effects: 3M estimates that year on year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income by approximately $150 million in 2007, $20 million in 2006 and $115 million in 2005. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year on year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased net income by approximately $10 million in 2007, had an immaterial impact on net income in 2006, and increased net income by approximately $50 million in 2005. PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2007, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. The reportable segments are the Health Care segment, Industrial and Transportation segment, Display and Graphics segment, Consumer and Office segment, Safety, Security and Protection Services segment, and Electro and Communications segment. Information related to 3Ms business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Local currency sales (which include both core and acquisition volume impacts, plus price impacts) are provided for each segment. The divestiture impact, translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each segment. 18 As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2006, 3M adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which required 3M to expense stock based compensation. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified retrospective method. Effective January 1, 2006, all prior periods were revised to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. For additional discussion, refer to Note 15. Stock based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is summarized by business segment in the table that follows. Stock based compensation expense Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Industrial and Transportation $ 58 $ 50 $ 46 Health Care 40 42 35 Display and Graphics 33 27 19 Consumer and Office 24 24 21 Safety, Security and Protection Services 23 21 16 Electro and Communications 21 21 18 Corporate and Unallocated 29 15 Total Company $ 228 $ 200 $ 155 As discussed in the preceding overview section, the combination of the 2007 gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of environmental liability charges, restructuring and other exit activities benefited 2007 operating income by $681 million, or 2.8% of net sales.

Industrial and Transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, closures for disposable diapers, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. The August 2005 acquisition of CUNO added a comprehensive line of filtration products for the separation, clarification and purification of fluids and gases. In 2007, local currency sales increased 5.8%, including 1.8% growth from acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2007, this segment added four complementary gap filling acquisitions, bringing total completed acquisitions for the year to seven. In combination with focused investments in research and development, these acquisitions will help strengthen the core tapes, adhesives and abrasives platforms for many years to come. Sales growth was broad based, led by industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, abrasives and automotive OEM businesses. All geographic areas contributed positively to growth. Significant manufacturing investments were made in emerging economies such as India, China and Poland to simplify the supply chain and get closer to local customers. Good operational discipline helped deliver operating income growth of 11.8%, with operating income margins of 20.6%. Operating income included $9 million in restructuring and other exit activity expenses, primarily comprised of severance and related benefits. In 2006, local currency sales grew 9.0%, including 4.6% growth from acquisitions, primarily related to the August 2005 acquisition of CUNO. Since CUNO was acquired in early August 2005 and is thus considered part of organic growth effective in August 2006, the acquisition benefit reflected in 2006 only reflects the months from January 2006 through July 2006. The industrial adhesives and tapes business, along with the automotive aftermarket business, which sells products to body shops for vehicle repairs, led organic sales growth in 2006. 3M also posted good sales growth in its abrasives business and its energy and advanced materials business. Growth in the automotive OEM business was impacted by softness in the U.S. domestic automotive industry. Geographically, local currency sales growth in dollars was strongest in the Asia Pacific and Europe areas. Operating income increased 11.0% to $1.342 billion in 2006. 20 Operating income included $15 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.2%. In March 2005, 3Ms automotive business completed the purchase of 19% of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&M) for approximately $55 million. TI&M is the parent company of I&T Innovation Technology Entwicklungs und Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed the firms flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&M, the Company was granted a put option, which gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&M to the other investors from whom 3M acquired its 19% interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&M investors have filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria. The Company is pursuing recovery of the balance of its investment both through the Austrian bankruptcy proceedings and pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded. Health Care Business (16.2% of consolidated sales): 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ 3,968 $ 4,011 $ 3,760 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 18.3 % 6.0 % 4.2 % Divestitures (23.7 ) Translation 4.3 0.7 0.4 Total sales change (1.1 )% 6.7 % 4.6 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,882 $ 1,845 $ 1,114 Percent change 2.0 % 65.6 % 14.6 % Percent of sales 47.4 % 46.0 % 29.6 % The Health Care segment serves markets that include medical, clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information systems. Products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems and microbiology solutions. As discussed in Note 2, the global branded pharmaceuticals business was sold in December 2006 and January 2007. In 2007, Health Care sales were $3.968 billion. Local currency growth was 18.3% (excluding divestitures), including 4.4 percentage points of growth from acquisitions and 4.5 percentage points of growth from supply agreements related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business. The sale of the pharmaceuticals business reduced Health Care sales growth by 23.7%. 3M provides disaggregated information on sales growth for Health Cares remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals) further below. The combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2007 Health Care operating income by $791 million. As discussed in Note 2, in January 2007 the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Europe region. The operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in Health Care, totaled $781 million. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, a net operating income gain of $10 million was recorded in 2007, which primarily related to adjustments to restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. In 2006, Health Care sales were $4.011 billion. Organic local currency growth was 5.3%, with acquisitions adding an additional 0.7% of growth. Local currency growth was led by the medical supplies and dental businesses. 3Ms pharmaceutical business was approximately 19% of Health Care sales in 2006. Pharmaceutical local currency sales declined 3.5% in 2006, while the remaining businesses 2006 local currency sales growth increased 8.5%. Geographically, Health Cares local currency sales growth was strongest in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific areas. Operating income for 2006 was up 65.6%, impacted by the gain on sale of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business, restructuring impacts and other items as discussed in the following paragraph, which positively impacted operating income growth by 60.4%. The combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2006 Health Care operating income by $673 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006. As discussed in Note 2, in early December 2006, the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. The Company also sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the United States, Canada and Latin America in late December 2006. The 21 operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in Health Care, totaled $1.074 billion. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, the Health Care segment for the year 2006 included $293 million in restructuring costs, primarily employee related severance and benefit costs. Of the $293 million, $166 million was related to the pharmaceuticals business and $15 million related to Health Care severance and other costs. In addition, $112 million of severance and benefit costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to worldwide staff overhead reduction actions taken to streamline the Companys cost structure in response to the sale of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business. Health Care also included $95 million of expensed in process research and development costs related to the Brontes acquisition and $13 million in environmental reserves related to the pharmaceuticals business. 3M believes the following disaggregated information for 3M Health Cares remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals) and for pharmaceuticals on a stand alone basis provides useful information. Health Care Business without Pharmaceuticals: 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ 3,968 $ 3,237 $ 2,963 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 18.3 % 8.5 % 5.3 % Translation 4.3 0.7 0.4 Total sales change 22.6 % 9.2 % 5.7 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,086 $ 806 $ 888 Percent change 34.6 % (9.1 )% 14.0 % Percent of sales 27.4 % 24.9 % 30.0 % The following discussion provides information on 3M Health Cares remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals). In 2007, sales growth was broad based across all platforms, led by infection prevention solutions and skin and wound care therapy products in medical, HFA based components (non CFC) for drug inhalers in drug delivery, and healthcare funding and performance management solutions for the hospital market in health information systems. Geographically, Health Care (without pharmaceuticals) achieved strong growth rates in all major regions, led by Europe, the United States, and the combined Latin America and Canada area. Local currency sales increased 18.3%, with acquisitions contributing 4.4 percentage points of this growth. Much of the acquisition growth came from two deals that closed in late 2006 Biotrace International, PLC, a U.K. based provider of microbiology products, and SoftMed, a Maryland based provider of health information software solutions. Health Care also closed five complementary acquisitions in 2007 to strengthen the portfolio and accelerate growth into the future in the medical, oral care and health information systems businesses. Sales growth also included 4.5 percentage points of growth due to supply agreements related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business. Operating income increased 34.6%, with an operating income margin of 27.4%. Operating income for 2007 included $5 million in restructuring expenses, primarily severance and related benefits. In 2006, sales were $3.237 billion. Organic local currency growth was 7.4%, with acquisitions adding an additional 1.1% of growth. Local currency growth was led by the medical supplies and dental businesses. Geographically, local currency sales growth was strongest in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific areas. Operating income for 2006 included $95 million of expensed in process research and development costs related to the Brontes acquisition and also included business specific restructuring actions that totaled $15 million, primarily comprised of severance and related benefits plus asset impairments. Including this combined operating income penalty of $110 million, or 12.4 percentage point negative impact on operating income growth, 2006 operating income decreased 9.1%. 22 Pharmaceuticals Business: 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ $ 774 $ 797 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) N/A (3.5 )% 0.3 % Translation N/A 0.6 0.3 Total sales change N/A (2.9 )% 0.6 % Operating income (millions) $ 796 $ 1,039 $ 226 Percent change N/A N/A 16.6 % Percent of sales N/A N/A 28.4 % The combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2007 pharmaceuticals operating income by $796 million. As discussed in Note 2, in January 2007 the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Europe region. The operating income gain related to this sale totaled $781 million. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, a net operating income gain of $15 million was recorded in 2007, which primarily related to adjustments to restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. Drug Delivery Systems Division (part of Health Care without Pharmaceuticals) is a source of supply to the acquiring companies and records sales and operating income related to the pharmaceuticals supply agreements. In total, the combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2006 pharmaceuticals operating income by $783 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006. As discussed in Note 2, in early December 2006, the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa.

The operating income gain related to these transactions totaled $1.074 billion. As discussed in Note 4, $112 million of severance and benefit costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to worldwide staff overhead reduction actions taken to streamline the Companys cost structure in response to the sale of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business. As also discussed in Note 4, the pharmaceuticals business for total year 2006 included $97 million in employee related severance and benefits and $69 million of asset impairments and other expenses. In addition, an environmental reserve of $13 million was recognized related to the pharmaceuticals business. Display and Graphics Business (15.9% of consolidated sales): 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ 3,892 $ 3,770 $ 3,547 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 1.8 % 6.0 % 4.6 % Divestitures (0.4 ) Translation 1.8 0.3 0.2 Total sales change 3.2 % 6.3 % 4.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,174 $ 1,044 $ 1,148 Percent change 12.4 % (9.0 )% 2.9 % Percent of sales 30.2 % 27.7 % 32.4 % The Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, touch screen, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film and lens solutions for electronic displays; touch screens and touch monitors; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; and commercial graphics systems. The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. The remaining lifetimes of such patents, as well as patents protecting future products, range from less than a few years to more than 10 years. These patents provide varying measures of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. 3Ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M with respect to some of these products. 23 In 2007, Display and Graphics local currency sales increased 1.8%, excluding the impact of the Opticom/Canoga business sale. The Company recorded positive sales growth in all major businesses commercial graphics, traffic safety systems and optical systems. Throughout the year, commercial graphics saw strong performance in the vehicle wrapping market where 3M provides films, inks and other products for this rolling billboard industry. The traffic safety systems business also experienced growth for the year, with faster growth internationally as the 3M reflective solutions for highway construction projects are a perfect match in developing economies that are adding infrastructure. In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses. 3M received proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized an operating income gain of $68 million in the Display and Graphics segment in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, Display and Graphics recorded restructuring and other exit activity expenses of $17 million in 2007. Operating income in 2007 was $1.174 billion, including this aggregate net operating income benefit of $51 million, which contributed 1.3 percentage points of the 30.2% operating income margin. Operating income in 2006 (as discussed below) included $39 million in restructuring expenses. These year on year impacts contributed 8.7 percentage points of the reported 12.4% operating income growth. Optical systems continues to focus on market segmentation, with strong penetration in handhelds, computer displays and LCD televisions. 3M continues to experience attachment rate pressure in LCD desktop monitors and LCD TV segments, although in the fourth quarter of 2007 3M saw a mix shift back to 1080p LCD TVs from 720p, which impacts 3M business as 3M films are used more heavily in the 1080p sets. 3M believes over the long term that 1080p LCD TVs will gain an increasing share of the overall LCD TV market. While 3M remains optimistic about the longer term prospects for the optical film business, continuing price and attachment rate pressure is expected in 2008. Due to this pressure, 3M expects Display and Graphics operating income margins in 2008 to decline a few percentage points when compared to 2007 (excluding the net operating income benefit of 1.3 percentage points in 2007 discussed in the preceding paragraph). 3Ms continued investment in this business has led to a solid stream of new products. 3Ms brightness enhancement films provide an environmental solution through reduced energy consumption an increasingly important requirement from both retail customers and government units. 3M has made significant sustainable factory improvements by relentlessly reducing costs and by adding needed capacity to secure future growth. In 2006, the Display and Graphics business posted local currency sales growth of 6.0%. Optical film sales volumes increased at double digit rates in 2006. 3M saw an acceleration in the LCD industry due to strong consumer demand for LCD TVs, which drove record sales of 3Ms proprietary optical films, despite ongoing downward pricing pressure in these consumer electronic applications. Commercial Graphics, a supplier of large format graphics solutions that cut across a range of industries, delivered strong double digit local currency growth in 2006. Traffic Safety Systems also posted solid local currency growth. Operating income declined by 9.0%. Operating income included $39 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 3.4%. These asset impairments relate to decisions the Company made in the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit certain marginal product lines in the Touch Systems and Optical Systems businesses. In optical film, selling price declines, the sales mix shift towards larger LCD displays, and operational challenges related to the Companys new optical film manufacturing production line penalized operating income in 2006. Consumer and Office Business (13.9% of consolidated sales): 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ 3,403 $ 3,164 $ 2,926 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 5.0 % 7.4 % 6.1 % Translation 2.6 0.7 1.0 Total sales change 7.6 % 8.1 % 7.1 % Operating income (millions) $ 688 $ 629 $ 609 Percent change 9.3 % 3.4 % 9.4 % Percent of sales 20.2 % 19.9 % 20.8 % The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, home improvement, building maintenance and other markets. Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products, home care products, protective material products and consumer health care products. In 2007, Consumer and Office experienced broad based local currency sales growth of 5.0%, led by the construction and home improvement and home cleaning businesses. In construction and home improvement, products such as Scotch Blue Painters Tape, Filtrete home furnace filters and Command mounting and fastening products, helped drive results. Geographically, international growth is gaining traction, while a slowdown in the United States was driven by soft 24 overall U.S. retail sales and a soft residential housing environment. Approximately 60% of global sales for this segment are in the United States. Operating income increased 9.3% and now exceeds 20% of sales. In 2006, Consumer and Office local currency sales growth of 7.4% was broad based across the portfolio, led by the construction and home improvement division, which serves the do it yourself retail channel. 3M also posted very good sales growth in the mass retail channel and continued to penetrate large key accounts, primarily in the United States, with an array of unique, highly functional products featuring customer inspired designs. Operating income was $629 million, up 3.4% year on year. 3M experienced slower sales growth in the construction and home improvement market in the fourth quarter of 2006, impacted by a housing slowdown in the United States. Safety, Security and Protection Services Business (12.6% of consolidated sales): 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ 3,070 $ 2,663 $ 2,320 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 10.8 % 13.7 % 6.8 % Translation 4.5 1.1 1.0 Total sales change 15.3 % 14.8 % 7.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 611 $ 549 $ 513 Percent change 11.3 % 7.1 % 14.3 % Percent of sales 19.9 % 20.6 % 22.1 % The Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, safety and security products, energy control products, cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, roofing granules for asphalt shingles, and supply chain execution software solutions. In August 2006, 3M completed the acquisition of Security Printing and Systems Limited, a producer of finished, personalized passports and secure cards, which expands the 3M product line related to border and civil security solutions. 3Ms new emerging business opportunity in its Track and Trace initiative within 3Ms Safety, Security and Protection Services segment resulted in the merging of a number of formerly separate efforts into one concerted effort for future growth. Track and Trace has a growing array of applications from tracking packages to managing medical and legal records. In 2007, local currency sales in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment were up 10.8%. Acquisitions contributed 7.4 percentage points of this growth, including a carry over benefit from the August 2006 acquisition of Security Printing and Systems Limited. In addition, during 2007 3M closed two small, but strategic, gap filling acquisitions. These included E. Wood, a U.K. based provider of corrosion protection products and Rochford Thompson, a manufacturer of optical character recognition passport readers used by airlines and immigration authorities. Sales growth was led by the respiratory protection business, followed by the security systems, corrosion protection and building and commercial services businesses. 2007 sales growth was held back by market softness in the U.S. residential construction market, which negatively impacted the roofing granules business. The decline in the roofing granules business reduced Safety, Security and Protection Services 2007 sales growth by approximately 1.5%. Geographically, sales growth was led by Europe and the combined Latin America and Canada area. This segment recorded a restructuring charge of $29 million in the second quarter of 2007 related to the phase out of operations at its New Jersey roofing granule facility. This included fixed asset impairments and employee related restructuring liabilities. Including this charge, operating income margins were approximately 20% for total year 2007. In 2006, local currency sales in the Safety, Security and Protection Services business were up 13.7%. Growth in the business was driven by strong global demand for personal safety products, especially respiratory protection. Acquisitions contributed 4.1% of growth, primarily due to the Security Printing and Systems Limited acquisition in August 2006. 3M continued to invest in additional respirator capacity, such as a new respirator manufacturing facility in Korea, which will serve the Asia Pacific region. 3M also posted outstanding growth in corrosion protection, a smaller but growing business, which supplies coatings for all types of commercial and industrial applications in a variety of industries. 3Ms roofing granules business experienced a challenging fourth quarter, with a sales decline of nearly 50%, resulting in sales in this business declining nearly 10% when comparing total year 2006 with 2005. Geographically, local currency growth was positive across all regions of the world, led by Europe and the United States. Operating income increased 7.1% to $549 million in 2006. Operating income includes $10 million in restructuring expenses, primarily severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.9%. 25 Electro and Communications Business (11.3% of consolidated sales): 2007 2006 2005 Sales (millions) $ 2,775 $ 2,631 $ 2,509 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 2.3 % 4.0 % 1.5 % Translation 3.2 0.8 0.7 Total sales change 5.5 % 4.8 % 2.2 % Operating income (millions) $ 481 $ 411 $ 422 Percent change 17.0 % (2.6 )% 40.7 % Percent of sales 17.3 % 15.6 % 16.8 % The Electro and Communications segment serves the electrical, electronics and communications industries, including electrical utilities; electrical construction, maintenance and repair; OEM electrical and electronics; computers and peripherals; consumer electronics; telecommunications central office, outside plant and enterprise; as well as aerospace, military, automotive and medical markets; with products that enable the efficient transmission of electrical power and speed the delivery of information and ideas. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, micro interconnect systems, high performance fluids, high temperature and display tapes, telecommunications products, electrical products, and visual systems products. In 2007, the Electro and Communications segment local currency sales increased 2.3%, including 1.5 percentage points from acquisitions. Strong sales growth in the communications and electrical markets businesses was partially offset by the flexible circuits business, which supplies components primarily to the ink jet printer market. This business continues to penalize segment results as the ink jet market has become commoditized and as a number of applications go end of life. Softness in this business held back overall Electro and Communications sales and operating income growth by 2.5 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively. Operating income increased 17% as this segment has driven productivity improvements and taken actions to improve its competitiveness. Operating income in 2007 was penalized by a $23 million charge related to consolidating its global flexible circuits manufacturing operations and $18 million in restructuring expenses, primarily for asset impairment charges related to the Companys decision to close a facility in Wisconsin. Combined, these two items negatively impacted 2007 operating income by $41 million and operating income margins by 1.5 percentage points. In 2006, the Electro and Communications business organic local currency growth of 2.7% was attributable to the electrical and electronics markets. Acquisitions contributed 1.3 percentage points to sales growth. 3M generated good top line growth in its electrical markets division, which sells a number of insulating, testing and connecting products and solutions to both power utilities and manufacturing OEMs. 3M saw good growth from its electronics markets business, driven by double digit growth in its semi conductor and assemblies business. Partially offsetting this was some sales softness in 3Ms U.S. communications markets business due to higher copper costs and a decline in 3Ms visual systems business, which traditionally offered analog overhead and electronic projectors and film. Operating income declined by 2.6% to $411 million. Operating income included $46 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 10.9%. Operating margins were impacted by rising raw material costs, specifically copper costs, in 3Ms electrical and telecommunications markets businesses. 26 PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 17. Operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by the gain on sale businesses and other items as discussed in Note A at the end of the preceding overview section. A summary of key information and discussion related to 3Ms geographic areas follow: Geographic Area 2007 2007 vs. 2006 % Change Net Sales and Total Operating Income % of Oper.

Export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3Ms results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end user consumption in that geographic area. U.S. local currency sales increased 5.7%, with acquisitions contributing 3.1 percentage points. U.S. local currency sales growth was led by Health Care (without Pharmaceuticals) and Industrial and Transportation, which was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the U.S. housing, road construction and mass retail markets, primarily roofing granules, protective materials, traffic safety and office supply businesses. Asia Pacific local currency sales increased 4.9%, with all six business segments contributing to this increase. Sales in Japan totaled approximately $2 billion, with local currency sales up 2% from 2006. European local currency sales increased 11.7%, with good growth across all segments, especially Safety, Security and Protection Services and Health Care (without Pharmaceuticals). In the combined Latin America and Canada area, local currency sales increases of 10.6% were led by Industrial and Transportation; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Health Care (without Pharmaceuticals). Foreign currency translation positively impacted European area sales by 8.5%, the combined Latin America and Canada area sales by 5.9%, and the Asia Pacific area by 2%, as the U.S. dollar weakened against these currencies. For 2007, international operations represented approximately 63% of 3Ms sales. Since 3M sold its global branded pharmaceuticals business in December 2006 and January 2007, both sales growth and operating income were negatively impacted when comparing 2007 to 2006. Sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals totaled $332 million in the United States, $315 million in the Europe, Middle East and Africa area, $77 million in the Asia Pacific area, and $50 million in the Latin America and Canada area. In 2007, the gain on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased worldwide operating income by $681 million, with the largest impact in the Europe, Middle East and Africa area. In 2006, the gain on sale, restructuring and other items increased worldwide operating income by $523 million, with the largest impact in the United States. These items are discussed in more detail in the preceding overview section. 27 Geographic Area Supplemental Information (Millions, except Employees as of Capital Property, Plant and Employees) December 31, Spending Equipment net 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 United States 34,138 34,553 33,033 $ 841 $ 692 $ 532 $ 3,668 $ 3,382 $ 3,291 Asia Pacific 12,970 12,487 11,574 299 252 228 1,116 959 865 Europe, Middle East and Africa 17,675 17,416 16,722 203 134 120 1,308 1,162 1,076 Latin America and Canada 11,456 10,877 9,898 79 90 63 490 404 361 Total Company 76,239 75,333 71,227 $ 1,422 $ 1,168 $ 943 $ 6,582 $ 5,907 $ 5,593 Employment: Employment increased by approximately 900 people since year end 2006, with acquisitions adding approximately 2,500 employees, while restructuring and the pharmaceuticals divestiture reduced employment. Employment increased by approximately 4,100 people in 2006 compared with 2005, partially due to acquisitions, with more than 750 people added by 3Ms three largest 2006 acquisitions alone. In addition, 3M has increased employees in faster growing areas of the world, such as Brazil, India, Russia, China and Poland, where on a local currency basis sales increased more than 15% in both 2007 and 2006. Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: The bulk of 3M capital spending historically has been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the United States. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 63% of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements. Capital expenditures were $1.422 billion in 2007 and are expected to total $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2008. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Companys pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors. Legal Proceedings: The categories of claims for which the Company has estimated its probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled Accrued Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Legal Proceedings in Note 13) for additional information about such estimates. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost, and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), which was issued in September 2006 and effective as of December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. 28 Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. The assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high, investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 6.00% to be appropriate as of December 31, 2007, which is an increase of 0.25 of a percentage point from the rate used as of December 31, 2006. A significant element in determining the Companys pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.75% for 2007 and will be reduced to 8.50% for 2008. Refer to Note 11 for information on how this rate is determined. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $190 million, down from $347 million in 2006. Pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to decrease to approximately $90 million in 2008. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase 2008 pension expense by approximately $26 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $11 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase 2008 pension expense by approximately $32 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $21 million for international pension plans. See Note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation. Asset Impairments: 3M net property, plant and equipment totaled $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2007. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit. Impairments recorded in 2007 and 2006 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in Note 4. 3M goodwill totaled approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, which, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. The majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. Income Taxes: The extent of 3Ms operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, the Company follows FIN 48 guidance to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Companys current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Companys estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. 29 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow. Increases in long term debt have been used, in part, to fund share repurchase activities and acquisitions. On November 15, 2007, 3M (Safety, Security and Protection Services Business) announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement for 3Ms acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Aearo Holding Corp. a global leader in the personal protection industry that manufactures and markets personal protection and energy absorbing products for approximately $1.2 billion. The sale is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter of 2008. At December 31 (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total Debt $ 4,920 $ 3,553 $ 2,381 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 2,955 2,084 1,072 Net Debt $ 1,965 $ 1,469 $ 1,309 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2007 totaled approximately $3 billion, helped by strong cash flow generation and by the timing of debt issuances. At December 31, 2006, cash balances were higher due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in December 2006. 3M believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures. The Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). The Companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $4.476 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.623 billion at December 31, 2006. Working capital was higher primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, receivables and inventories and decreases in short term debt and accrued income taxes. The Companys liquidity remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2007 totaling approximately $3 billion. Primary short term liquidity needs are provided through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2007, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $349 million and averaged $1.249 billion during 2007. The Company believes it unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. In June 2007, the Company established a medium term notes program through which up to $3 billion of medium term notes may be offered, with remaining shelf borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. On April 30, 2007, the Company replaced its $565 million credit facility with a new $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which has provisions for the Company to request an increase of the facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders discretion), and providing for up to $150 million in letters of credit. As of December 31, 2007, there are $110 million in letters of credit drawn against the facility. At December 31, 2007, available short term committed lines of credit internationally totaled approximately $67 million, of which $13 million was utilized. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. The Company has a well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective February 24, 2006, to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable securities and $87 million of ESOP debt) had ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. The Company has an AA credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moodys Investors Service. In addition, under the $1.5 billion five year credit facility agreement, 3M is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2007, this ratio was approximately 35 to 1. 3Ms cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2007 totaled $1.896 billion, with an additional $1.059 billion in current and long term marketable securities. 3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. As previously discussed, 3M expects to complete 30 the acquisition of Aearo Holding Corp. for approximately $1.2 billion in 2008. 3M paid dividends of $1.380 billion in 2007, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2008, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 4.2% to 50 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.00 per share. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. At December 31, 2007, the Company has $4.1 billion remaining under this authorization, which the Company does not currently expect to fully utilize by February 28, 2009. In 2008, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $400 million to its U.S. and international pension plans. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2008. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. plans funding status as of the 2008 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.3 at December 31, 2007, down from 5.4 at December 31, 2006. Receivables increased $260 million, or 8.4%, compared with December 31, 2006. Currency translation increased accounts receivable by $159 million year on year, as the U.S. dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies. Inventories increased $251 million, or 9.7%, compared with December 31, 2006. Currency translation increased inventories by $132 million year on year. Accounts payable increased $103 million compared with December 31, 2006, with $65 million of this year on year increase related to currency translation. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net income $ 4,096 $ 3,851 $ 3,111 Depreciation and amortization 1,072 1,079 986 Company pension contributions (376 ) (348 ) (654 ) Company postretirement contributions (3 ) (37 ) (134 ) Company pension expense 190 347 331 Company postretirement expense 65 93 106 Stock based compensation expense 228 200 155 Gain from sale of businesses (849 ) (1,074 ) Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) (34 ) (178 ) 402 Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (74 ) (60 ) (54 ) Accounts receivable (35 ) (103 ) (184 ) Inventories (54 ) (309 ) (294 ) Accounts payable (4 ) 68 113 Product and other insurance receivables and claims 158 58 122 Other net (105 ) 252 198 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,275 $ 3,839 $ 4,204 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In both 2007 and 2006, the Company made discretionary contributions of $200 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan, and in 2005 made discretionary contributions totaling $500 million. 31 In 2007, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $436 million, including an increase in net income of $245 million. Since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income, the pre tax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted, as shown above, to properly reflect operating cash flows. The cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities; however, when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities. Thus, operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business. Non pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments, which benefited cash flows. Accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007, but decreased cash flow less than in 2006, resulting in a year on year benefit to cash flows of $323 million. The category Other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3Ms restructuring actions (Note 4). In 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $365 million. This decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005. The higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the Companys repatriation of $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the United States pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The category Other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including outstanding liabilities at December 31, 2006, related to 3Ms restructuring actions (Note 4). Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $ (1,422 ) $ (1,168 ) $ (943 ) Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets 103 49 41 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (539 ) (888 ) (1,293 ) Proceeds from sale of businesses 897 1,209 Purchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments net (406 ) (662 ) (46 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,367 ) $ (1,460 ) $ (2,241 ) Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2007, numerous plants were opened or expanded internationally. This included two facilities in Korea (respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant), an optical plant in Poland, industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both Brazil and the Philippines, a plant in Russia (corrosion protection, industrial adhesive and tapes, and respirators), a plant in China (optical systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, and personal care), an expansion in Canada (construction and home improvement business), in addition to investments in India, Mexico and other countries. In addition, 3M expanded manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical. 3M also exited several high cost underutilized manufacturing facilities and streamlined several supply chains by relocating equipment from one facility to another. The streamlining work has primarily occurred inside the U.S. and is in addition to the streamlining achieved through plant construction. As a result of this increased activity, capital expenditures were $1.422 billion in 2007, an increase of $254 million when compared to 2006. The Company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2008. Refer to the preceding Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment section for more detail. Refer to Note 2 for information on 2007, 2006 and 2005 acquisitions. Note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium term note securities, auction rate securities and other securities, which are classified as available for sale. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3Ms diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $1.059 billion as of December 31, 2007. Purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, totaled $429 million for 2007 and $637 million for 2006. Purchases of investments in 2005 include the purchase of 19% of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH for approximately $55 million, which is reported as Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and as Purchases of marketable securities and investments in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The recovery of approximately $25 million of this investment in 2007 reduced Investments and is shown in cash flows within Proceeds from sale of marketable securities and investments. This investment is discussed in more detail under the preceding section 32 entitled Industrial and Transportation Business. Additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Change in short term debt net $ (1,222 ) $ 882 $ (258 ) Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (1,580 ) (440 ) (656 ) Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 4,024 693 429 Total cash change in debt $ 1,222 $ 1,135 $ (485 ) Purchases of treasury stock (3,239 ) (2,351 ) (2,377 ) Reissuances of treasury stock 796 523 545 Dividends paid to stockholders (1,380 ) (1,376 ) (1,286 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 74 60 54 Distributions to minority interests and other net (20 ) (52 ) (76 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,547 ) $ (2,061 ) $ (3,625 ) Total debt at December 31, 2007, was $4.920 billion, up from $3.553 billion at year end 2006. The net change in short term debt is primarily due to commercial paper activity. In 2007, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days is primarily comprised of commercial paper repayments of approximately $1.15 billion and the November 2007 redemption of approximately $322 million in Convertible Notes. In 2007, proceeds from debt included long term debt and commercial paper issuances totaling approximately $4 billion. This was comprised of Eurobond issuances in December 2007 and July 2007 totaling approximately $1.5 billion in U.S. dollars, a March 2007 long term debt issuance of $750 million and a December 2007 fixed rate note issuance of $500 million, plus commercial paper issuances (maturities greater than 90 days) of approximately $1.25 billion. Increases in long term debt have been used, in part, to fund share repurchase activities. The Company accelerated purchases of treasury stock when compared to prior years, buying back $3.2 billion in shares in 2007. Total debt was 30% of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity), compared with 26% at year end 2006. Debt securities, including 2007 debt issuances, the Companys shelf registration, dealer remarketable securities and Convertible Notes, are all discussed in more detail in Note 10. The Company has a well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective February 24, 2006, to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. On June 15, 2007, the Company registered 150,718 shares of the Companys common stock under this shelf on behalf of and for the sole benefit of the selling stockholders in connection with the Companys acquisition of assets of Diamond Productions, Inc. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. In connection with this shelf registration, in June 2007 the Company established a medium term notes program through which up to $3 billion of medium term notes may be offered. In December 2007, 3M issued a five year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65% under this medium term notes program. This program has a remaining capacity of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. The Companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (classified as current portion of long term debt) were remarketed for one year in December 2007. At December 31, 2007, $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity 2010) and $62 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2044) are classified as current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. The Company has Convertible Notes with a book value of $222 million at December 31, 2007. The next put option date for these Convertible Notes is November 2012. In November 2007, 364,598 outstanding bonds were redeemed resulting in a payout from 3M of approximately $322 million. Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $4.1 billion remained available for repurchase. Refer to the table titled Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5, for more information. Cash dividends paid to stockholders totaled $1.380 billion ($1.92 per share) in 2007, $1.376 billion ($1.84 per share) in 2006 and $1.286 billion ($1.68 per share) in 2005. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2008, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 4.2% to 50 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.00 per share. This marked the 50th consecutive year of dividend increases. Other cash flows from 33 financing activities primarily include distributions to minority interests, excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: As of December 31, 2007, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements. 3Ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $21 million. 3M does not consider this amount to be material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material. In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property. While 3Ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, follows: Contractual Obligations Payments due by year After (Millions) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2012 Long term debt, including current portion (Note 10) $ 4,559 $ 540 $ 477 $ 24 $ $ 500 $ 3,018 Interest on long term debt 2,671 211 185 170 169 169 1,767 Operating leases (Note 13) 441 98 79 58 35 30 141 Capital leases (Note 13) 84 7 6 6 6 5 54 Unconditional purchase obligations and other 787 626 120 33 5 2 1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,542 $ 1,482 $ 867 $ 291 $ 215 $ 706 $ 4,981 Long term debt payments due in 2008 include $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity 2010) and $62 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2044). These securities are classified as the current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending in 2008 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis. Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled Unconditional purchase obligations and other, include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long term portion of the liability of $304 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 8 for further details. As discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2008 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2008 and future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. 34 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the Companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2007. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. The model used analyzed 17 currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures. Adverse impact on Positive impact on (Millions) after tax earnings after tax earnings 2007 2006 2007 2006 Foreign exchange rates $ (54 ) $ (56 ) $ 57 $ 61 Interest rates (13 ) (15 ) 15 17 Commodity rates (3 ) (6 ) 2 5 The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1% price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $60 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10% price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $38 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1% of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10% of this energy exposure. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7, contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may also make forward looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the Companys representatives may from time to time make oral forward looking statements. Forward looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Companys expected future business and financial performance. Words such as plan, expect, aim, believe, project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward looking statements. In particular, these include statements about the Companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 35 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the context of Item 7A, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Long Term Debt and Short Term Borrowings, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The Company does not have leveraged derivative positions. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). 36
