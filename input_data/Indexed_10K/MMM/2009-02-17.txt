Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3Ms financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3Ms MD&A is presented in nine sections: Beginning page Overview 12 Results of Operations 16 Performance by Business Segment 19 Performance by Geographic Area 29 Critical Accounting Estimates 30 New Accounting Pronouncements 32 Financial Condition and Liquidity 32 Financial Instruments 38 Forward Looking Statements 38 OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2008, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Consumer and Office; Display and Graphics; and Electro and Communications. 3M had record sales in 2008 despite a dramatic fourth quarter 2008 economic downturn. 3M is responding to this lower demand with aggressive cost and cash management, along with tighter operational discipline. 3M expects to manage through these worldwide market challenges and is positioning itself to benefit when growth returns. 3M streamlined its operations through 2008 and will continue to optimize to protect against the downside throughout 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008 alone, 3M announced reductions of over 2,400 full time positions worldwide, which brought total year reductions to approximately 3,500. These job eliminations spanned all sectors and all geographies, but were particularly focused on those developed economies experiencing the most sales pressure. In addition, 3M has furloughed factory workers until production volumes return to more normal levels and contract workers are also being reduced to only those considered essential. These 2008 actions in total are expected to save the Company $250 to $300 million in 2009. 3M also decided to defer merit pay increases in 2009 except in those cases where local laws prohibit it, with estimated cost avoidance of approximately $100 million in 2009. In addition, 3M has amended its practice on banked vacation effectively phasing it out which will reduce expenses by an estimated $100 million in both 2009 and 2010. While this market is difficult to predict, in 2009 for planning purposes, 3M is assuming year on year declines in organic sales volume, negative foreign currency impacts on sales, operating margin declines, and earnings per share declines. 3M will work to conserve cash by reducing capital expenditures by more than 30 percent in 2009 and by focusing on reducing working capital. 3M has halted stock repurchases until the credit market offers more visibility. The strength of 3Ms customer focused diversified business and technology platforms, unparalled geographic reach, and relentless attention to operational excellence, along with 3Ms balance sheet strength, provide a strong foundation for stability and consistency in an uncertain global economy. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, sales decreased 11.2 percent compared to the same period last year, due to an increasingly challenging global economy. Local currency sales (which include volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but exclude divestiture and translation impacts) increased in Safety, Security and Protection Services and in Health Care. Sales in local currencies for the other four business segments dropped during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2008 net income was $536 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $851 million, or $1.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. In response to difficult economic conditions, in the fourth quarter of 2008, 3M took actions which resulted in net pre tax charges of $219 million for restructuring actions and exit activities, which reduced net income by $140 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, as 3M aggressively balanced its cost structure to a slower growth environment. The fourth quarter of 2007 included net pre tax charges of $20 million related to restructuring, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses, which reduced net income by $12 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Refer to the Special Items summary at the end of this overview section for more detail on these items that impacted results. For total year 2008, sales increased 3.3 percent to $25.3 billion, with local currency sales up 1.4 percent. Operating income margins were 20.6 percent, including restructuring and other items that negatively impacted operating income by $269 million, or 1.1 percentage points. In addition to the fourth quarter items noted in the preceding paragraph, refer to the Special Items summary at the end of this overview section for discussion of other items impacting 12 Table of Contents results. In 2008, restructuring and other special items negatively impacted net income by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. In 2007, the largest special item was the gain on sale of businesses, primarily the global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe, which, combined with other items, benefited 2007 net income by $448 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. Including these special items, 3M reported net income of $3.460 billion, or $4.89 per diluted share for 2008, compared to net income of $4.096 billion, or $5.60 per diluted share, for 2007. In December 2006 and January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business, resulting in gains in the fourth quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007. In addition, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses in the second quarter of 2007. In both 2007 and 2006, these gains on sale of businesses were partially offset by restructuring and the net impact of other special items. Refer to Special Items at the end of this overview section for additional details. Including these special items, in 2007, 3M reported net sales of $24.462 billion and net income of $4.096 billion, or $5.60 per diluted share, compared with net sales of $22.923 billion and net income of $3.851 billion, or $5.06 per diluted share, in 2006. Excluding the special items in both years, the Company still achieved strong underlying operating performance, helped by a 6.7 percent increase in net sales, which included the divestiture impacts discussed above that reduced sales growth by 3.8 percent. The following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for discussion of the gain or loss on sale of businesses, restructuring and other items that impacted reported operating income results. 2008 vs. 2007 2008 2007 % change Net % of Oper.

Safety, Security and Protection Services sales growth was led by acquisitions, primarily Aearo, along with organic growth in personal protection solutions, protective window films and cleaning solutions for commercial buildings, and RFID solutions (Track and Trace). Geographic area sales growth in this business segment was strong in every region, helped by Aearo, with organic sales growth led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. Health Care sales growth was strongest in orthodontics, dental and medical, with positive sales growth in all major geographies, led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. Industrial and Transportation had broad based sales growth across the portfolio and all major geographies, with strong sales growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, abrasives, and closure systems for personal hygiene products. Sales in Consumer and Office were led by the home care and do it yourself markets, with sales growth geographically led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. Consumer and Office experienced weakness in 2008 as slowdowns in the U.S. office markets and residential housing markets persist. Electro and Communications sales growth was led by electrical markets and electronic markets materials, with geographic sales growth strongest in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The electronics solutions and communications markets businesses remain soft. 3M also continued to experience declines in the flexible circuits business, where a number of product solutions are going end of life. Within Display and Graphics, positive sales growth in Traffic Safety Systems and Commercial Graphics was more than offset by lower sales in Optical Systems. Optical Systems sales were down 34 percent when compared to 2007, resulting in a sales decline for total Display and Graphics of 16.6 percent. Selling price and attachment rate pressure remain intense in segments of the LCD market as OEMs aggressively pursue cost reductions from their component suppliers, including 3M. In addition, demand dropped significantly in November and December of 2008 as numerous orders were canceled for large size LCD panels due to weak holiday season sales, reflecting the global downturn in consumer and corporate demand. Refer to the Performance by Business Segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments. 13 Table of Contents Worldwide total sales growth was 3.3 percent in 2008. Local currency sales growth was 1.4 percent for 2008, including a 3.3 percentage point benefit from acquisitions. Local currency sales increased 18.3 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services (including 14.1 percentage points from acquisitions), 6.8 percent in Health Care (including 1.7 percentage points from acquisitions) and 4.6 percent in Industrial and Transportation (including 3.9 percentage points from acquisitions). Local currency sales declined 0.3 percent in Consumer and Office, 1.7 percent in Electro and Communications and 17.9 percent in Display and Graphics. In 2007, worldwide total sales increased 6.7 percent. Local currency sales growth was 7.3 percent, with organic local currency growth of 4.9 percent (including 0.7 percentage point benefit from pharmaceuticals supply agreements) and acquisitions adding 2.4 percent. Divestitures, primarily the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business (Health Care segment), decreased worldwide sales growth by 3.8 percent. The sale of the pharmaceuticals business was not presented as a discontinued operation due to the extent of the projected continuing cash flows from 3Ms contractual supply relationship with the buyers in relation to those of the business that was sold. Geographically, Latin America and Canada led local currency sales growth in 2008, with a combined increase of 12.8 percent, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa (hereafter referred to as Europe) with a 2.8 percent increase and the United States with a 2.7 percent increase. Local currency sales in Asia Pacific declined 5.9 percent. Asia Pacific was negatively impacted by Optical Systems sales, which were down 34 percent in that region. Excluding Optical Systems, Asia Pacific sales increased nearly 6 percent on a local currency basis. Of the local currency sales growth, acquisitions contributed 3.2 percent to the combined Latin America and Canada, 3.2 percent to Europe, 5.3 percent to the United States, and 0.8 percent to Asia Pacific. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international sales by 3.4 percent, as the U.S. dollar weakened in aggregate against many currencies in these geographic areas. Foreign currency translation positively impacted Latin America and Canada by 2.4 percent, Europe by 4.0 percent and Asia Pacific by 3.2 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2008, foreign currency negatively impacted international sales by 7.5 percent. While difficult to predict given the current exchange rate volatility, foreign currency is also expected to have a significant negative impact in 2009. Worldwide operating income for 2008 decreased 15.7 percent year on year, with most of this impact due to the year on year change in special items discussed at the end of this overview. In the preceding table, Health Care operating income in 2007 included significant gains related to the sale of portions of its pharmaceuticals business in 2007, negatively impacting the 2008 versus 2007 year on year comparisons for this business segment. Worldwide operating income margins were 20.6 percent in 2008, including a 1.1 percent penalty from special items in 2008. Operating income for 2007 increased 8.7 percent year on year, including a net 2.2 percentage point benefit from the impact of items discussed in Special Items below. Operating income margins were approximately 25 percent in both 2007 and 2006, with special items positively impacting these margins in both years by approximately 2.5 percentage points. 3M generated $4.533 billion of operating cash flow in 2008, an increase of $258 million compared to 2007, which followed an increase of $436 million when comparing 2007 to 2006. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company utilized approximately $1.4 billion of cash each year to pay dividends. In 2008, repurchases of 3M common stock totaled approximately $1.6 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in 2007 and $2.4 billion in 2006. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $2.6 billion remained available for repurchase. In February 2009, 3Ms Board of Directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining $2.6 billion is fully utilized. With the Companys current emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength, share repurchase activity has been suspended. However, extension of this program will provide flexibility to resume repurchase activity when business conditions permit. In February 2009, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 2 percent for 2009, marking the 51st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3Ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2008 was 40 percent, compared to 30 percent at December 31, 2007. A portion of the increase in debt was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the U.S. in the current market environment. 3M has an AA credit rating from Standard & Poors, with a stable outlook, and an Aa1 credit rating from Moodys Investors Service, with a negative outlook. The Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. In 2008, the Company experienced cost increases affecting metals, wood pulp and oil derived raw materials. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. 14 Table of Contents In 2009, 3M is changing its annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant date to more closely align the award with the timing of the Companys performance review process. In 2009 and forward, under the annual grant, 3M will grant shares in February instead of May as in previous years. Accounting rules requires recognition of expense under a non substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. 3M employees in the United States are eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years of service. Approximately 25 percent of the stock based compensation award expense dollars are for this retiree eligible population. Therefore, in 2006, 2007 and 2008 the second quarter of each year (because of the May grant date) reflected higher stock based compensation expense than the other quarters. In 2009, the retiree eligible impact will shift to the first quarter of 2009. In addition, both the first and second quarter of 2009 will reflect accelerated stock based compensation expense related to the earlier February grant date. These and other factors result in a first quarter 2009 estimate of $0.08 per diluted share for stock based compensation expense compared to $0.04 in the first quarter of 2008. In the second quarter of 2009 estimated stock based compensation is estimated at $0.04 per diluted share compared to $0.06 in the second quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 16 for additional discussion of the Companys stock based compensation programs. During 2008 the funded status of the Companys global pension plans declined from 100 percent to 85 percent. As of December 31, 2008, the U.S. pension plans funded status was 89 percent with the qualified plan at 92 percent, and the international plans at 75 percent. By utilizing an effective hedging strategy for both fixed income and equity investments, the Company was able to limit the decline in U.S. pension plans assets to a negative 13.6% return in 2008, much better than the overall market. In 2009, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $600 million to $850 million to its U.S. and international pension plans. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2009. The changes in 3Ms defined benefit pension and postretirement plans funded status, which are required to be measured as of each year end, significantly impacted several balance sheet line amounts at December 31, 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, these required annual measurements decreased prepaid pension benefits assets by $1.7 billion, increased deferred taxes within other assets by $1.1 billion, increased pension and postretirement benefits long term liabilities by $1.7 billion and decreased stockholders equity (reflected after taxes) by $2.3 billion. Other pension and postretirement changes during the year, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet captions. Refer to critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3Ms pension and post retirement plans. The preceding forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward looking statements section in Item 7 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). Special Items: Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in the Companys underlying operations. In 2008, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $269 million and net income by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. 2008 included restructuring actions ($229 million pre tax, $147 million after tax and minority interest), exit activities ($58 million pre tax, $43 million after tax) and losses related to the sale of businesses ($23 million pre tax, $32 million after tax), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($41 million pre tax, $28 million after tax). Divestiture impacts, restructuring actions and exit activities are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures) and Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities). Concerning the real estate gain, 3M received proceeds and recorded a gain in 2008 for a sale leaseback transaction relative to an administrative location in Italy. 3M anticipates leasing back the facility through late 2009 at which time a new location will be utilized. In 2007, gains on sale of businesses and real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased operating income by $681 million and net income by $448 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. 2007 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of businesses ($849 million pre tax, $550 million after tax) and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million pre tax, $37 million after tax), which were partially offset by increases in environmental liabilities ($134 million pre tax, $83 million after tax), restructuring actions ($41 million pre tax, $27 million after tax), and other exit activities ($45 million pre tax, $29 million after tax). These items, except the gain on sale of real estate, are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures), Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities) and Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies). Gains on sale of businesses include the second quarter 2007 sale of 3Ms Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses, and the first quarter 2007 sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. Concerning the real estate sale, 3M sold a laboratory facility located in Suwon, Korea. 15 Table of Contents In 2006, gains on sale of businesses, net of restructuring and other items, increased operating income by $523 million and net income by $438 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3Ms branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre tax, $674 million after tax) and favorable income tax adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by restructuring actions ($403 million pre tax, $257 million after tax), acquired in process research and development expenses ($95 million pre tax and after tax), settlement costs of an antitrust class action ($40 million pre tax, $25 million after tax), and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million pre tax, $8 million after tax). These items, except the settlement costs and environmental obligations, are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures), Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities) and Note 8 (Income Taxes). Concerning settlement costs, the Company recorded $40 million in 2006 with respect to a settlement in principle related to the antitrust class action brought on behalf of direct purchasers who did not purchase private label tape. Concerning environmental obligations, the Company increased its reserves by $13 million during 2006 for estimated environmental remediation costs at a European pharmaceutical plant.

In 2007, the gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of environmental liability charges, restructuring and exit activities, benefited 2007 operating income by $681 million, or 2.8 percent of net sales. In 2006, the gain on sale of businesses, net of restructuring and other items, benefited 2006 operating income by $523 million, or 2.2 percent of net sales. The following tables summarize these items by operating expense category. Items included in the Other category of the table for 2006 are acquired in process research and development expenses ($95 million), settlement costs of a antitrust class action ($40 million), and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million). 16 Table of Contents 2008 Restructuring and Other Summary Loss Gain on sale Restructuring Exit on sale of of real (Millions) actions activities businesses estate Total Cost of sales $ 84 $ 38 $ $ $ 122 Selling, general and administrative expenses 135 17 (41 ) 111 Research, development and related expenses 10 3 13 Loss on sale of businesses 23 23 Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ 229 $ 58 $ 23 $ (41 ) $ 269 2007 Gain on Sale, Restructuring and Other Summary Gain on Environ Restructuring Gain on sale Sale of mental and exit of real (Millions) businesses liabilities activities estate Total Cost of sales $ $ $ 64 $ $ 64 Selling, general and administrative expenses 134 26 (52 ) 108 Research, development and related expenses (4 ) (4 ) Gain on sale of businesses (849 ) (849 ) Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ (849 ) $ 134 $ 86 $ (52 ) $ (681 ) 2006 Gain on Sale, Restructuring and Other Summary Gain on sale of Pharmaceuticals Overhead Business Total pharmaceuticals restructuring reduction specific restructuring (Millions) business actions actions actions actions Other Total Cost of sales $ $ 32 $ 24 $ 74 $ 130 $ 13 $ 143 Selling, general and administrative expenses 66 81 51 198 40 238 Research, development and related expenses 68 7 75 95 170 Gain on sale of businesses (1,074 ) (1,074 ) Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ (1,074 ) $ 166 $ 112 $ 125 $ 403 $ 148 $ (523 ) Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased 0.8 percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007, with this increase primarily due to the decline in Optical Systems sales and the rapid volume declines of certain other businesses in the fourth quarter. For the majority of the year 3Ms broad based portfolio performed as expected, with benefits from selling price increases, foreign currency translation, and a continuous focus on driving operational excellence, helping to offset raw material inflation of approximately 4 percent for 2008, compared with 2007. In 2008, restructuring and exit costs increased cost of sales by $122 million, or 0.4 percentage points as a percent of net sales, similar to the 0.3 percentage point impact in 2007, as discussed below. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased 1.0 percentage point in 2007 compared to 2006, with this increase primarily due to the sale of the branded pharmaceuticals business, which had lower than average cost of sales. Raw material costs increased approximately 1 percent in 2007, compared with 2006. In 2007, restructuring and exit costs increased cost of sales by $64 million, or 0.3 percentage points. These charges primarily related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit manufacturing operations, the phaseout of operations at the Companys New Jersey roofing granule facility and charges related to the Companys decision to close an Electro and Communications facility in Wisconsin. In 2006, restructuring and other items increased cost of sales by $143 million, or 0.7 percentage points. 17 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.3 percentage points in 2008 when compared to 2007, or 4.6 percent in dollars. In 2008, SG&A expenses related to restructuring actions and exit activities were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined increased SG&A by $111 million, or 0.5 percentage points, similar to the 0.4 percentage point impact in 2007, as discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2008, as part of its restructuring program, 3M took aggressive actions to reduce general and administrative expenses and also pared back selling and marketing costs in certain businesses. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2007 when compared to 2006, as expenses incurred in 2006 in the Companys now divested global branded pharmaceuticals business did not repeat in 2007. Non pharmaceutical ongoing SG&A expenses, after adjusting for the following items, were up approximately 7 percent in dollars, as the Company invested in sales and marketing to support growth markets. In 2007, SG&A includes increases in environmental liabilities, restructuring charges and exit activities, net of the gain on sale of real estate ($108 million combined net expense), which increased SG&A as a percent of sales by 0.4 percentage points. 2006 included restructuring actions and settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($238 million combined expense), which increased 2006 SG&A as a percent of sales by 1.0 percentage points. In dollars, SG&A decreased $51 million when comparing 2007 to 2006, with the change in restructuring and other items year on year decreasing SG&A by $130 million, pharmaceutical SG&A spending decreasing $241 million and other SG&A spending increasing $320 million, or approximately 7 percent in dollars. Research, Development and Related Expenses: Research, development and related expenses (R&D) in 2008 as a percent of net sales was 5.6 percent, the same as in 2007, while spending in dollars increased. 3Ms long term commitment to R&D is unchanged, but in the current economic environment 3M is closely scrutinizing all discretionary investments. R&D as a percent of net sales decreased 1.0 percentage point in 2007 when compared to 2006, as expenses incurred in 2006 in the Companys now divested R&D intensive pharmaceuticals business did not repeat in 2007. Non pharmaceutical ongoing R&D expenses, after adjusting for the following items, were up approximately 11 percent in dollars, as the Company invested in future technologies and growth opportunities. 2006 spending included a $95 million in process research and development charge (discussed in Note 2) and $75 million in restructuring actions (Note 4), which increased 2006 R&D as a percent of sales by 0.7 percentage points. In dollars, R&D spending decreased $154 million when comparing 2007 to 2006, with the change in restructuring and other items year on year decreasing R&D by $174 million, 2006 pharmaceutical SG&A spending decreasing $120 million and other R&D spending increasing $140 million, or approximately 11 percent in dollars. (Gain)/Loss on Sale of Businesses: In June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software, a 3M Company, to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre tax loss of $23 million (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment) in the second quarter of 2008. In January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe to Meda AB. 3M received proceeds of $817 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, a pre tax gain of $781 million in 2007 (recorded in the Health Care segment). In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses to TorQuest Partners Inc., a Toronto based investment firm. 3M received proceeds of $80 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre tax gain of $68 million (recorded in the Display and Graphics segment) in 2007. In December 2006, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals businesses in the United States, Canada, and Latin America region and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. 3M received proceeds of $1.209 billion for these transactions and recognized a pre tax gain on sale of $1.074 billion in 2006 (recorded in the Health Care segment). For more detail, refer to Note 2. Operating Income: 3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income decreased in 2008 to 20.6 percent of sales, negatively impacted by restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses that were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by 1.1 percentage points ($269 million). Operating income margins of 25.3 percent in 2007 were positively impacted by 2.8 percentage points ($681 million) from the gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of environmental liabilities, restructuring and other exit activities. Operating income margins of 24.8 percent for 2006 were positively impacted by 2.2 percentage points ($523 million) from the gain on sale of portions of the pharmaceuticals business, net of restructuring and other actions. Adjusting for the preceding items, operating income margins in 2007 were similar to 2006. 18 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Income: (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 215 $ 210 $ 122 Interest income (105 ) (132 ) (51 ) Total $ 110 $ 78 $ 71 Interest Expense: Interest expense increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily related to higher average U.S. and international long term debt balances, which were partially offset by lower short term debt balances and interest rates. Interest expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to higher average debt balances and higher interest rates. Interest Income: Interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher average cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest income increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes: (Percent of pre tax income) 2008 2007 2006 Effective tax rate 31.1 % 32.1 % 30.6 % The effective tax rate for 2008 was 31.1 percent compared with 32.1 percent in 2007. The Companys 2008 tax rate benefited from reduced international tax rates. The tax rate for 2007 was 32.1 percent compared with 30.6 percent in 2006. The Companys 2006 tax rate included benefits from adjustments to its reserves for tax contingencies following the settlement of income tax audits. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. Minority Interest: (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Minority interest $ 60 $ 55 $ 51 Minority interest expense eliminates the income or loss attributable to non 3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. 3Ms most significant consolidated entity with non 3M ownership interests is Sumitomo 3M Limited in Japan (3M owns 75 percent of Sumitomo 3M Limited). Currency Effects: 3M estimates that year on year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income by approximately $160 million in 2008, $150 million in 2007 and $20 million in 2006. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks other than instruments hedging foreign currency risks on tax obligations. 3M estimates that year on year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased net income by approximately $40 million in 2008, increased net income by approximately $10 million in 2007 and had an immaterial impact on net income in 2006.

The following tables summarize these special items by business segment. 2008 Restructuring and Other Summary Loss Gain on Restructuring Exit on sale of sale of (Millions) actions activities businesses real estate Total Industrial and Transportation $ 40 $ 26 $ $ $ 66 Health Care 51 9 60 Safety, Security and Protection Services 12 3 23 38 Consumer and Office 18 18 Display and Graphics 24 18 42 Electro and Communications 7 7 Corporate and Unallocated 77 2 (41 ) 38 Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ 229 $ 58 $ 23 $ (41 ) $ 269 2007 Gain on Sale, Restructuring and Other Summary Gain on Restructuring Gain on sale of Environmental and exit sale of (Millions) businesses liabilities activities real estate Total Industrial and Transportation $ $ $ 9 $ $ 9 Health Care: Gain on sale of pharmaceuticals business (781 ) (781 ) Restructuring actions and other (10 ) (10 ) Safety, Security and Protection Services 29 29 Consumer and Office Display and Graphics (68 ) 17 (51 ) Electro and Communications 41 41 Corporate and Unallocated 134 (52 ) 82 Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ (849 ) $ 134 $ 86 $ (52 ) $ (681 ) 2006 Gain on Sale, Restructuring and Other Summary Gain on sale of Pharmaceuticals Overhead Business Total pharmaceuticals restructuring reduction specific restructuring (Millions) business actions actions actions actions Other Total Industrial and Transportation $ $ $ $ 15 $ 15 $ $ 15 Health Care: Gain on sale of pharmaceuticals business (1,074 ) (1,074 ) Restructuring actions and other 166 112 15 293 108 401 Safety, Security and Protection Services 10 10 10 Consumer and Office Display and Graphics 31 31 31 Electro and Communications 54 54 54 Corporate and Unallocated 40 40 Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ (1,074 ) $ 166 $ 112 $ 125 $ 403 $ 148 $ (523 ) 20 Table of Contents Due to the significant impact of the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 on sales and operating income results, the following discusses both fourth quarter 2008 and total year 2008 results for each business segment. Industrial and Transportation Business (30.9% of consolidated sales): 2008 2007 2006 Sales (millions) $ 7,818 $ 7,266 $ 6,632 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 4.6 % 5.8 % 9.0 % Translation 3.0 3.8 0.8 Total sales change 7.6 % 9.6 % 9.8 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,477 $ 1,497 $ 1,338 Percent change (1.4 )% 11.9 % 11.0 % Percent of sales 18.9 % 20.6 % 20.2 % The Industrial and Transportation segment serves a broad range of markets, such as appliance, paper and packaging, food and beverage, electronics, automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and automotive aftermarket (auto body shops and retail). Industrial and Transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. 2008 can be characterized as a tale of two distinct chapters for Industrial and Transportation. The first was January through October, characterized by outstanding top and bottom line growth across most of the portfolio; the second chapter was the combined months of November and December, when many large customers slowed their operations. 3M expects that the strength of its new products, supply chain improvements and expansion into areas like energy, aerospace, filtration and now renewable energy, will help carry it through some very challenging times. Among 3Ms business segments, Industrial and Transportation has been among those most affected by recent economic contractions, particularly in big industries such as automotive and electronics. With worldwide industrial production in decline, 3Ms Industrial and Transportation business had fourth quarter 2008 sales of $1.7 billion, an 11.3 percent decline compared to 2007. Local currency sales were down 6.3 percent, including a positive 3.2 percent impact from acquisitions. Not all divisions within Industrial were impacted equally in the fourth quarter. Those that are heavily linked to automotive manufacturing, namely automotive OEM and 3M Dyneon, saw declines of more than 20 percent, as did businesses selling to the electronics industry, such as high tech tapes and adhesives. Most other divisions experienced local currency sales contractions of less than 10 percent in the fourth quarter. The most significant bright spot in the quarter was the automotive aftermarket business, which contributed solid local currency growth. Geographically, fourth quarter 2008 local currency sales were down in all regions, with the largest declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, followed by Europe. Local currency sales were flat in Latin America. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 42 percent to $203 million, which included net charges of $36 million for restructuring actions and exit activities. Full year 2008 sales looked far more positive, with sales up 7.6 percent to $7.8 billion. Local currency growth rates were strongest in the automotive aftermarket business. 3M also drove strong sales growth in two of its largest divisions, namely abrasives and industrial tapes and adhesives. Closure systems for personal hygiene products also showed good growth. Geographically, all major regions drove positive local currency sales growth. Strong market penetration continued in emerging economies, especially the high growth BRICP countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and Poland), where the business drove strong organic local currency growth. Operating income declined, but increased after adjusting for $66 million in restructuring actions and exit activities (discussed further below). Strong operational discipline was the key to protecting the bottom line as full year operating margins totaled 18.9 percent, with operating income margins at 19.7 percent after adjusting for restructuring and exit activities. Industrial and Transportation restructuring and exit activities totaled $66 million for total year 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008, restructuring actions totaling $40 million (partially offset by a $4 million reduction in previously accrued exit activity charges) were comprised of severance and related benefits totaling $33 million and asset impairments of $7 million. Net exit activity charges of $26 million in 2008 largely related to employee reductions at an Industrial and Transportation manufacturing facility located in the United Kingdom, which totaled $19 million. This compared to restructuring actions and exit activities of $9 million in 2007. 21 Table of Contents Industrial and Transportation continues to invest in innovative new products along with complementary gap fill acquisitions, evidenced by the closing of eight acquisitions in 2008, with some of the larger acquisitions summarized as follows. In July 2008, 3M acquired K&H Surface Technologies Pty. Ltd., an Australian based manufacturing company specializing in a range of repair products for the professional do it yourself automotive refinish markets. In August 2008, 3M acquired Polyfoam Products Inc., a structural adhesives company specializing in foam adhesives for tile roofing and other adhesive products for the building industry. In October 2008, 3M completed its acquisition of EMFI S.A. and SAPO S.A.S., manufacturers of polyurethane based structural adhesives and sealants headquartered in Haguenau, France. In October 2008, 3M also completed its acquisition of Meguiars Inc., a 100 year old business that manufactures the leading Meguiars brand of car care products for cleaning and protecting automotive surfaces, which is headquartered in Irvine, California. In 2007, local currency sales increased 5.8 percent, including 1.8 percent growth from acquisitions. Sales growth was broad based, led by industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, abrasives and automotive OEM businesses. All geographic areas contributed positively to growth. Significant manufacturing investments were made in emerging economies such as India, China and Poland to simplify the supply chain and get closer to local customers. Good operational discipline helped deliver operating income growth of 11.9 percent, with operating income margins of 20.6 percent. Operating income in 2007 included $9 million in restructuring and other exit activity expenses, primarily comprised of severance and related benefits. Operating income in 2006 included $15 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits. In March 2005, 3Ms automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&M) for approximately $55 million. TI&M is the parent company of I&T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed the firms flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&M, the Company was granted a put option, which gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&M to the other investors from whom 3M acquired its 19 percent interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&M investors have filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria. The Company is pursuing recovery of the balance of its investment both through the Austrian bankruptcy proceedings and pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company received approximately $6 million of its investment back in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded. Health Care Business (17.0% of consolidated sales): 2008 2007 2006 Sales (millions) $ 4,293 $ 3,968 $ 4,011 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) 6.8 % 18.3 % 6.0 % Divestitures (0.1 ) (23.7 ) Translation 1.5 4.3 0.7 Total sales change 8.2 % (1.1 )% 6.7 % Operating income (millions) $ 1,173 $ 1,882 $ 1,845 Percent change (37.7 )% 2.0 % 65.6 % Percent of sales 27.3 % 47.4 % 46.0 % The Health Care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information systems. Products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems and anti microbial solutions. As discussed in Note 2, the global branded pharmaceuticals business was sold in December 2006 and January 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Health Care sales topped $1 billion, despite a nearly 7 percentage point penalty from currency translation. In local currency terms, sales rose 4.5 percent, including 2.2 percent from acquisitions. 3M saw solid local currency growth in the medical products area, specifically in core infection prevention and skin and wound care products. Geographically, the U.S. and Asia Pacific led sales growth. Operating income margins of 24.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 were the highest in the Company, which includes the impact of $50 million in restructuring and exit activity charges that reduced operating income margins by 4.9 percentage points. This is a highly competitive 22 Table of Contents environment where 3Ms brand presence and high quality are clearly making a difference. Doctors, hospitals and other medical service providers continue to show a strong preference for 3M products. For full year 2008, Health Cares results were strong, with sales increasing 8.2 percent to $4.3 billion and operating income margins of 27.3 percent. As discussed further below, both 2007 and 2006 operating income results include significant gains from the sale of 3Ms pharmaceuticals business in December 2006 and January 2007, negatively impacting the 2008 versus 2007 year on year operating income comparison. Local currency sales were up 6.8 percent, largely organic, but also included 1.7 percent from acquisitions. In 2008, 3M closed a number of important bolt on acquisitions in Health Care, including TOP Service, a German orthodontic technology and services company offering a digital lingual solution; Imtec, an Oklahoma based manufacturer of dental implants and cone beam computed tomography; and Solumed, a Quebec based developer and marketer of leading edge medical products designed to prevent infections in operating rooms and hospitals. Full year 2008 sales were led by strong increases in 3Ms medical, dental and orthodontics businesses. Sales grew in all geographies, led by strong gains in Asia Pacific and Latin America. In 2007, Health Care sales were $3.968 billion. Local currency growth was 18.3 percent (excluding divestitures), including 4.4 percentage points of growth from acquisitions and 4.5 percentage points of growth from supply agreements related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business. The sale of the pharmaceuticals business reduced Health Care sales growth by 23.7 percent. 3M provides disaggregated information on sales growth for Health Cares remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals) further below. The combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2007 Health Care operating income by $791 million. As discussed in Note 2, in January 2007 the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Europe region. The operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in Health Care, totaled $781 million. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, a net operating income gain of $10 million was recorded in 2007, which primarily related to adjustments to restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. The combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2006 Health Care operating income by $673 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006. As discussed in Note 2, in early December 2006, the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa. The Company also sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the United States, Canada and Latin America in late December 2006. The operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in Health Care, totaled $1.074 billion. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, the Health Care segment for the year 2006 included $293 million in restructuring costs, primarily employee related severance and benefit costs. Of the $293 million, $166 million was related to the pharmaceuticals business and $15 million related to Health Care severance and other costs.

Acquisitions contributed 7.4 percentage points of this growth, including a carry over benefit from the August 2006 acquisition of Security Printing and Systems Limited. Sales growth was led by the respiratory protection business, followed by the security systems, corrosion protection and building and commercial services businesses. 2007 sales growth was held back by market softness in the U.S. residential construction market, which negatively impacted the roofing granules business. The decline in the roofing granules business reduced Safety, Security and Protection Services 2007 sales growth by approximately 1.5 percent. Geographically, sales growth was led by Europe and the combined Latin America and Canada area. This segment recorded a restructuring charge of $29 million in the second quarter of 2007 related to the phaseout of operations at its New Jersey roofing granule facility.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, Consumer and Office sales declined 11.2 percent to $765 million. Local currency sales were down 6.5 percent and currency impacts reduced sales by just under 5 percentage points. U.S. sales declined by 13 percent, heavily impacted by the ongoing slump in U.S. consumer retail spending levels. More than 50 percent of sales in Consumer and Office are generated within the United States. By far the biggest contributor to this decline was the retail and wholesale office channel. The combination of massive office worker layoffs, coupled with across the board declines in office retail foot traffic, had a dramatic and negative impact on sales. 3M businesses serving other U.S. retail channels performed well in the fourth quarter despite this rough economic environment. This business posted positive local currency sales for its home care products, such as Scotch Brite Scrub Sponges, and for its do it yourself retail channel. Elsewhere around the globe, 3Ms Consumer and Office business drove positive local currency sales growth in both Latin America and Asia Pacific, but overall growth was muted by declines in Europe. Worldwide operating income declined in the fourth quarter, including the impact of $18 million in restructuring charges, which contributed 11.4 percentage points of this 35.5 percent decline. For total year 2008, Consumer and Office sales grew just over 1 percent. This business has successfully created new products and designed new programs and planograms with their large U.S. customers in order to mitigate what is a very tough end market situation. Sales growth was led by home care and do it yourself products. Operating income declined 4.1 percent and margins were in excess of 19 percent, an outstanding return considering what was a slow U.S. market environment and a synchronized slowdown in growth across most others areas of the world. Geographically, sales growth was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. Operating income was negatively impacted by the $18 million in restructuring charges discussed in the preceding paragraph. Going forward, 3M expects sales growth in the Consumer and Office segment to continue to be led by international operations as U.S. growth will remain uncertain over the near term due to challenging economic conditions. In 2007, Consumer and Office experienced broad based local currency sales growth of 5.0 percent, led by the construction and home improvement and home cleaning businesses. In construction and home improvement, products such as Scotch Blue Painters Tape, Filtrete Furnace Filters and Command Mounting Products, helped drive results. Geographically, international growth led sales, while a slowdown in the United States was driven by soft overall U.S. retail sales and a soft residential housing environment. Operating income increased 9.2 percent and exceeded 20 percent of sales. 26 Table of Contents Display and Graphics Business (12.9% of consolidated sales): 2008 2007 2006 Sales (millions) $ 3,255 $ 3,904 $ 3,747 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) (17.9 )% 2.7 % 5.0 % Divestitures (0.3 ) (0.4 ) Translation 1.6 1.9 0.3 Total sales change (16.6 )% 4.2 % 5.3 % Operating income (millions) $ 580 $ 1,163 $ 1,045 Percent change (50.1 )% 11.3 % (9.7 )% Percent of sales 17.8 % 29.8 % 27.9 % The Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film solutions for electronic displays; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; commercial graphics systems; and projection systems, including mobile display technology and visual systems products. The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. Results in this business continue to be affected by end market challenges in 3Ms optical films business, which is in the midst of transition from a hyper growth business a few years ago to one that is more commoditized in nature. Demand for optical films slowed considerably in November and December of 2008 as TV, desktop monitor and notebook PC makers cancelled orders for large size LCD panels due to weak holiday season sales, reflecting the global downturn in both consumer and corporate demand. For the fourth quarter, 3M posted sales of $685 million in Display and Graphics. Sales declined 28 percent, or about 8 percent excluding optical. Traffic safety systems posted local currency sales growth of nearly 3 percent, as highway infrastructure projects around the world continue to grow at a modest rate. Local currency sales declined by 6.3 percent in 3Ms commercial graphics business and by 48 percent in optical systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 80 percent, which included net charges of $22 million for restructuring actions and exit activities. For the full year of 2008, sales declined 16.6 percent, driving operating income down 50 percent to $580 million. Operating margins were at 17.8 percent for 2008. 3M has taken aggressive action during 2008 to reduce its cost structure across all businesses within Display and Graphics with particular focus on the optical film business. 3M continues to champion the energy saving story in the LCD monitor segment, and is gaining traction, but volumes remain low at this early stage. Second half 2008 restructuring charges and exit activities of $42 million reduced operating income for total year 2008. These expenses were comprised of severance/related benefits and asset impairments. In 2007, 3M recorded a gain on the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses, which was partially offset by expenses related to restructuring and exit activities. These items on a combined basis benefited operating income by $51 million in 2007 (as discussed in more detail in the next paragraph). In aggregate, these items contributed approximately 6.0 percentage points of this 50.1 percent operating income decline when comparing 2008 to 2007. In addition, the 2008 restructuring and exit activity charges reduced 2008 operating income margins by 1.3 percentage points, while the 2007 net benefit contributed 1.3 percentage points of the 29.8 percent operating income margin for 2007. In 2007, Display and Graphics local currency sales increased 2.7 percent, excluding the impact of the Opticom/Canoga business sale. The Company recorded positive sales growth in all major businesses commercial graphics, traffic safety systems and optical systems. Throughout the year, commercial graphics saw strong performance in the vehicle wrapping market where 3M provides films, inks and other products for this rolling billboard industry. The traffic safety systems business also experienced growth for the year, with faster growth internationally as the 3M reflective solutions for highway construction projects are a perfect match in developing economies that are adding infrastructure. In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses. 3M received proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized an operating income gain of $68 million in the Display and Graphics segment in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, Display and Graphics recorded restructuring and other exit activity expenses of $17 million in 2007. Operating income in 2007 was $1.163 billion, including this aggregate net operating income benefit of $51 million, 27 Table of Contents which contributed 1.3 percentage points of the 29.8 percent operating income margin. Operating income in 2006 (as discussed in more detail in the next paragraph) included $31 million in restructuring expenses. These year on year impacts contributed 7.9 percentage points of the reported 11.3 percent operating income growth. Operating income in 2006 included $31 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits. These asset impairments relate to decisions the Company made in the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit certain marginal product lines in the Optical Systems business. Electro and Communications Business (11.0% of consolidated sales): 2008 2007 2006 Sales (millions) $ 2,791 $ 2,763 $ 2,654 Sales change analysis: Local currency (volume and price) (1.7 )% 1.0 % 5.5 % Translation 2.7 3.1 0.8 Total sales change 1.0 % 4.1 % 6.3 % Operating income (millions) $ 531 $ 492 $ 410 Percent change 8.0 % 19.7 % (0.6 )% Percent of sales 19.0 % 17.8 % 15.5 % The Electro and Communications segment serves the electrical, electronics and communications industries, including electrical utilities; electrical construction, maintenance and repair; original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electrical and electronics; computers and peripherals; consumer electronics; telecommunications central office, outside plant and enterprise; as well as aerospace, military, automotive and medical markets; with products that enable the efficient transmission of electrical power and speed the delivery of information and ideas. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, micro interconnect systems, high performance fluids, high temperature and display tapes, telecommunications products, electrical products, and touch screens and touch monitors. This business serves a number of end markets, the most important being consumer electronics and telecommunications, along with the global power utility industry. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the weak holiday season experienced by the consumer electronics retailers had a large and negative impact on sales in this business. Likewise the global telecommunications sector continues to cut capital spending on new capacity and on upgrades of existing equipment. 3M had a large number of equipment orders cancelled during the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of this end market contraction, sales in Electro and Communications declined by 15 percent in the fourth quarter. Sales in local currency decreased about 12 percent, and currency impacts hurt sales by about 3 percentage points. Operating income declined 38.8 percent, which included $7 million in restructuring expenses. For the full year 2008, sales in Electro and Communications increased 1 percent to $2.8 billion, while operating income increased 8 percent to $531 million. Operating margins were at 19 percent. The Electrical Markets and Electronic Markets Materials businesses drove growth. The Communications Markets and Electronics Solutions businesses remain soft. 3M also continued to experience declines in the flexible circuits business where a number of product solutions are going end of life. Operating income in 2008 was impacted by $7 million in restructuring expenses, while 2007 included $18 million in restructuring expenses, primarily for asset impairment charges related to the Companys decision to close a facility in Wisconsin, and $23 million for employee reductions and fixed asset impairments related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit manufacturing operations. In aggregate, these items contributed 6.9 percentage points of the reported 8.0 percent operating income growth when comparing 2008 to the 2007. In 2007, the Electro and Communications segment local currency sales increased 1.0 percent, driven by 1.5 percentage points from acquisitions. Strong sales growth in the communications and electrical markets businesses was offset by declines in the flexible circuits business, which supplies components primarily to the ink jet printer market, as a number of applications go end of life. Softness in this business held back overall Electro and Communications sales and operating income growth by approximately 2.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Operating income increased 19.7 percent as this segment has driven productivity improvements and taken actions to improve its competitiveness. Operating income in 2007 was penalized by a $23 million charge related to consolidating its global flexible circuits manufacturing operations and $18 million in restructuring expenses, primarily for asset impairment charges related to the Companys decision to close a facility in Wisconsin. Combined, these two items negatively impacted 2007 operating income by $41 million and operating income margins by 1.5 percentage points. In 2006, operating income included $54 million in restructuring 28 Table of Contents expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits, including expenses related to the decision to exit certain marginal product lines in the 3M Touch Systems business. PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18. Operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by the gain on sale of businesses and other items as discussed at the end of the preceding overview section. As discussed in Note 18, effective in 2008, the Company changed its allocations of R&D to more closely align these costs with the geographic areas that benefit, with no change in worldwide results. The operating income presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. A summary of key information and discussion related to 3Ms geographic areas follow: Geographic Area 2008 2008 vs. 2007 % Change Net Sales and Operating Income % of Oper. Local Total Sales Oper.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3Ms results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end user consumption in that geographic area. In 2008, U.S. local currency sales increased 2.7 percent, with acquisitions contributing 5.3 percentage points. U.S. organic local currency sales growth was led by Health Care. Safety, Security and Protection Services and Industrial and Transportation also drove positive sales growth, helped by acquisitions. This was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the U.S. housing, road construction and mass retail markets and office supply businesses. Asia Pacific local currency sales declined 5.9 percent. The significant decrease in Optical Systems within Display and Graphics more than offset the sales growth in the other five business segments. Sales in Japan totaled approximately $2.2 billion, with local currency sales down 5.2 percent from 2007. Europe local currency sales increased 2.8 percent, helped by acquisitions, with growth in Safety, Security and Protection Services, Health Care, and Industrial and Transportation. In the combined Latin America and Canada area, local currency sales increased 12.8 percent, with growth in all business segments. Foreign currency translation positively impacted Europe sales by 4.0 percent, the combined Latin America and Canada area sales by 2.4 percent, and the Asia Pacific area by 3.2 percent, as the U.S. dollar weakened in aggregate against currencies in these geographic areas. For 2008, international operations represented approximately 64 percent of 3Ms sales. In 2008, restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses, which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $269 million, with the largest impact in the United States and Europe. In 2007, the gain on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased worldwide operating income by $681 million, with the largest impact in Europe. In 2006, the gain on sale, restructuring and other items increased worldwide operating income by $523 million, with the largest impact in the United States. Since 3M sold its global branded pharmaceuticals business in December 2006 and January 2007, both sales growth and operating income were negatively impacted when comparing 2007 to 2006. Sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals totaled $332 million in the United States, $315 million in Europe, $77 million in the Asia Pacific area, and $50 million in the Latin America and Canada area. In addition to 2008 sales and operating income results provided above, refer to Note 18 for geographic area results for 2007 and 2006. 29 Table of Contents Geographic Area Supplemental Information (Millions, except Employees as of Capital Property, Plant and Employees) December 31, Spending Equipment net 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 United States 33,662 34,138 34,553 $ 780 $ 841 $ 692 $ 3,901 $ 3,668 $ 3,382 Asia Pacific 13,960 12,970 12,487 338 299 252 1,304 1,116 959 Europe, Middle East and Africa 19,185 17,675 17,416 253 203 134 1,263 1,308 1,162 Latin America and Canada 12,376 11,456 10,877 100 79 90 418 490 404 Total Company 79,183 76,239 75,333 $ 1,471 $ 1,422 $ 1,168 $ 6,886 $ 6,582 $ 5,907 Employment: Employment increased by approximately 2,900 people since year end 2007, with acquisitions during 2008 adding approximately 3,700 people as of December 31, 2008. In 2008 and 2007, 3M increased employees in the BRICP countries (Brazil, India, Russia, China and Poland), where total sales increased more than 15 percent in both years. These increases were offset by reductions in employment in 2008 for a portion of the job eliminations that were announced in connection with restructuring and exit activities. Employment increased by approximately 900 people when comparing year end 2007 to year end 2006, with acquisitions adding approximately 2,500 employees, while restructuring and the pharmaceuticals divestiture reduced employment. Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: The bulk of 3M capital spending historically has been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the United States. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 64 percent of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements. Capital expenditures were $1.471 billion in 2008, similar to 2007. Capital expenditures are expected to be reduced by more than 30 percent in 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Companys pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors. Legal Proceedings: The categories of claims for which the Company has estimated its probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled Accrued Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Legal Proceedings in Note 14) for additional information about such estimates. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost, and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), which was issued in September 2006 and effective as of December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes 30 Table of Contents in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. The assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 6.14% to be appropriate as of December 31, 2008, which is an increase from the 6.00% rate used as of December 31, 2007. A significant element in determining the Companys pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, refer to Note 11 for information on how the 8.50% expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2009 is determined. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $89 million, down from $190 million in 2007. Pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $125 million in 2009. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase 2009 pension expense by approximately $26 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $9 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease 2009 pension expense by approximately $30 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $12 million for international pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate of 0.25 of a percentage point would increase 2009 pension expense by approximately $31 million for U.S. pension and plans and approximately $14 million for international pension plans. See Note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation. Asset Impairments: 3M net property, plant and equipment totaled $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2008. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Impairments recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in Note 4. 3M goodwill totaled approximately $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2008, which, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3M has six business segments at December 31, 2008), but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. As of December 31, 2008, 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. 3M completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. As of December 31, 2008, 3M had 34 primary reporting units, with eight reporting units accounting for nearly 80 percent of the goodwill. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. These eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Occupational Health and Environmental Safety, CUNO, Optical Systems, ESPE, Communication Markets, Security Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, and Health Information Systems. These 31 Table of Contents eight reporting units all generated operating income for total year 2008. As part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3M used discounted cash flow models for its CUNO, Optical Systems and Security Systems divisions. A weighted average discounted cash flow analysis was performed for the CUNO and Optical Systems Divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on managements estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. The discounted cash flows for the CUNO, Optical Systems and Security Systems divisions were all in excess of their respective net book values, with no impairment indicated. In 2008, in addition to using discounted cash flows for certain reporting units, 3M used an adjusted industry price earnings ratio approach for the remaining reporting units. 3M adjusted the stated applicable industry price earnings ratio downward for its annual test in the fourth quarter, unlike prior years when no adjustment was required. Without this adjustment, the addition of each reporting units estimated market values would have been significantly in excess of 3Ms total Company market value, which would have resulted in an unusually high implied control premium. The control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3Ms total Company market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total Company. For example, at year end 2008, 3Ms market value was approximately $40 billion, but if each reporting unit was sold individually, 3Ms value would be approximately $52 billion using a 30 percent control premium. 3M factored down its price/earnings ratio significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the price/earnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of approximately 30 percent for the total Company. Even after including this adjustment to the price earnings ratio, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. In addition, 3Ms market value at December 31, 2008 of approximately $40 billion is significantly in excess of its book value of approximately $10 billion. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2009 for any triggering events or other signs of impairment. Income Taxes: The extent of 3Ms operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, the Company follows FIN 48 guidance to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Companys current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Companys estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The strength of 3Ms capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3M stable access to capital markets in these uncertain times. During recent dislocation in the financial markets, 3M has had uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market. Interest rates on commercial paper issued by the Company have not been materially negatively impacted by the market difficulties. 3M borrowed $850 million via a long term debt issue in August 2008 with a coupon of 4.375%. 3M also raised $800 million via a three year debt issue in October 2008 with a coupon of 4.5%. Despite the market turmoil, 3M was able to secure funding to alleviate concerns about having ample liquidity to meet its foreseeable needs. As indicated in the table below, at December 31, 2008, 3M had $2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $6.7 billion of debt. Debt is comprised of $1.552 billion of short term debt, including $575 million of commercial paper, and $5.166 billion of long term debt. Approximately $900 million of the long term debt is classified as current, including $350 million in Dealer Remarketable Securities, which ultimately mature in December 2010, and a $62 million floating rate note, which has a put option. At December 31, 2008, the majority of the Companys long term debt balance does not mature until 2011 or later. Thus, while credit markets remain volatile, 3Ms capital structure remains very strong. 3M is committed to managing its capital structure very carefully. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow. Increases in long term debt have been used to partially fund share repurchase activities and acquisitions. On April 1, 2008, 3M (Safety, Security and Protection Services Business) completed its acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Aearo a global leader in the personal protection 32 Table of Contents industry that manufactures and markets personal protection and energy absorbing products for approximately $1.2 billion, inclusive of debt assumed, which was immediately paid off. At December 31 (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Total Debt $ 6,718 $ 4,920 $ 3,553 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 2,574 2,955 2,084 Net Debt $ 4,144 $ 1,965 $ 1,469 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2008 totaled approximately $2.6 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of $4.5 billion. At December 31, 2007, cash balances were higher due to strong cash flow generation and by the timing of debt issuances. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). The Companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $3.759 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $4.476 billion at December 31, 2007. Working capital decreases were attributable to declines in cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities and accounts receivable, while increases in short term debt and other current liabilities also decreased working capital. This was partially offset by working capital increases attributable to decreases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes, combined with increases in inventory. Primary short term liquidity needs are met through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2008, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $575 million and averaged $1.106 billion during 2008. The Company believes it unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. In June 2007, the Company established a medium term notes program through which up to $3 billion of medium term notes may be offered, with remaining shelf borrowing capacity of $850 million as of December 31, 2008 (see additional discussion in following paragraph). Effective April 30, 2007, the Company has a $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which has provisions for the Company to request an increase of the facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders discretion), and providing for up to $150 million in letters of credit. At December 31, 2008, available short term committed lines of credit, including the preceding $1.5 billion five year credit facility, totaled approximately $1.582 billion, of which approximately $143 million was utilized for letters of credit in connection with normal business activities. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. The Company has a well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective February 24, 2006, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. In connection with this shelf registration, in June 2007 the Company established a medium term notes program through which up to $3 billion of medium term notes may be offered. In December 2007, 3M issued a five year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65% under this medium term notes program. In August 2008, 3M issued a five year, $850 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375% under this medium term notes program. In October 2008, the Company issued a three year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.50%, under this medium term notes program, reducing remaining capacity to $850 million as of December 31, 2008. The Company has the ability to increase the amount of securities that are authorized to be issued under this program. The Company has an AA credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poors and an Aa1 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moodys Investors Service. At December 31, 2008, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable securities and $44 million of ESOP debt) had ratings triggers (BBB /Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. In addition, under the $1.5 billion five year credit facility agreement, 3M is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2008, this ratio was approximately 30 to 1. 33 Table of Contents 3Ms cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2008 totaled $1.849 billion, with an additional $725 million in current and long term marketable securities. 3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.398 billion in 2008, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2009, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 2 percent to 51 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.04 per share. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company has $2.6 billion remaining under this authorization. In February 2009, 3Ms Board of Directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining $2.6 billion is fully utilized. In 2009, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $600 million to $850 million to its U.S. and international pension plans. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2009. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. qualified plans funding status as of the 2009 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 4.5 at December 31, 2008, down from 5.3 at December 31, 2007. Receivables decreased $167 million, or 5.0 percent, compared with December 31, 2007. Currency translation decreased accounts receivable by $97 million year on year, as the U.S. dollar strengthened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies. Inventories increased $161 million, or 5.6 percent, compared with December 31, 2007. Currency translation decreased inventories by $134 million year on year. Accounts payable decreased $204 million compared with December 31, 2007. Currency translation decreased accounts payable by $35 million year on year. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 3,460 $ 4,096 $ 3,851 Depreciation and amortization 1,153 1,072 1,079 Company pension contributions (421 ) (376 ) (348 ) Company postretirement contributions (53 ) (3 ) (37 ) Company pension expense 89 190 347 Company postretirement expense 16 65 93 Stock based compensation expense 202 228 200 Loss/(Gain) from sale of businesses 23 (849 ) (1,074 ) Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) (44 ) (34 ) (178 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (21 ) (74 ) (60 ) Accounts receivable 197 (35 ) (103 ) Inventories (127 ) (54 ) (309 ) Accounts payable (224 ) (4 ) 68 Product and other insurance receivables and claims 153 158 58 Other net 130 (105 ) 252 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,533 $ 4,275 $ 3,839 34 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company made discretionary contributions of $200 million to its U.S. qualified pension plan. In 2008, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $258 million. Net income decreased $636 million, primarily due to gains from the sale of businesses in 2007 which did not repeat in 2008. Accounts receivable decreases benefited cash flows in 2008, but increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable negatively impacted cash flows. The category Other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including outstanding liabilities at December 31, 2008 related to 3Ms restructuring actions (Note 4). In 2007, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $436 million, including an increase in net income of $245 million. Since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income, the pre tax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted, as shown above, to properly reflect operating cash flows. The cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities; however, when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities. Thus, operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business. Non pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments, which benefited cash flows. Accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007, but decreased cash flow less than in 2006, resulting in a year on year benefit to cash flows of $323 million. The category Other net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3Ms restructuring actions (Note 4). Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $ (1,471 ) $ (1,422 ) $ (1,168 ) Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets 87 103 49 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (1,394 ) (539 ) (888 ) Proceeds from sale of businesses 88 897 1,209 Purchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments net 291 (406 ) (662 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,399 ) $ (1,367 ) $ (1,460 ) Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2008, major facility efforts included completion of production lines in the United States for both Consumer and Office and Health Care, an R&D laboratory in Korea, a tape building in Poland, and numerous tape lines and building expansions in China. In 2008, 3M also made progress towards completion of investments in a Singapore multi purpose manufacturing facility and film production facilities and made progress towards completion of manufacturing cost reduction investments in two of its U.S. film manufacturing plants. For 2009, 3M has already cut capital spending plans more than 30 percent. A substantial amount of the 2009 expected spending will be carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations. In 2007, numerous plants were opened or expanded internationally. This included two facilities in Korea (respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant), industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both Brazil and the Philippines, a plant in Russia (corrosion protection, industrial adhesive and tapes, and respirators), a plant in China (optical systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, and personal care), an expansion in Canada (construction and home improvement business), in addition to investments in India, Mexico and other countries. In addition, 3M expanded manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical. As a result of this increased activity, capital expenditures were $1.422 billion in 2007, an increase of $254 million when compared to 2006. Refer to Note 2 for information on 2008, 2007 and 2006 acquisitions. Note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available for sale. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in 35 Table of Contents asset backed securities. The coupon interest rates for asset backed securities are either fixed rate or floating. Floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly LIBOR rate. Each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective LIBOR rate +/ an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. Terms of the reset are unique to individual securities. Fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond. The spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3Ms diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $725 million as of December 31, 2008. Proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, total approximately $282 million in 2008. Purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, totaled $429 million in 2007 and $637 million in 2006. In 2005, 3M purchased 19 percent of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH for approximately $55 million. In 2007, the recovery of approximately $25 million reduced Investments and is shown in cash flows within Proceeds from sale of marketable securities and investments. This investment is discussed in more detail under the preceding section entitled Industrial and Transportation Business. Additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Change in short term debt net $ 361 $ (1,222 ) $ 882 Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (1,080 ) (1,580 ) (440 ) Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 1,756 4,024 693 Total cash change in debt $ 1,037 $ 1,222 $ 1,135 Purchases of treasury stock (1,631 ) (3,239 ) (2,351 ) Reissuances of treasury stock 289 796 523 Dividends paid to stockholders (1,398 ) (1,380 ) (1,376 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 21 74 60 Distributions to minority interests and other net (84 ) (20 ) (52 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,766 ) $ (2,547 ) $ (2,061 ) Total debt at December 31, 2008, was $6.718 billion, up from $4.920 billion at year end 2007. Total debt was 40 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity), compared with 30 percent at year end 2007. The net change in short term debt is primarily due to commercial paper activity. In 2008, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days primarily represents debt acquired upon the acquisition of Aearo that was immediately repaid and repayment of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days. Proceeds from debt primarily include a five year, $850 million, fixed rate note issued in August 2008 with a coupon rate of 4.375%, and a three year, $800 million, fixed rate note issued in October 2008 with a coupon rate of 4.5% (refer to Note 10 for more information). Total debt at December 31, 2007, was $4.920 billion, up from $3.553 billion at year end 2006. The net change in short term debt is primarily due to commercial paper activity. In 2007, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days is primarily comprised of commercial paper repayments of approximately $1.15 billion and the November 2007 redemption of approximately $322 million in Convertible Notes. In 2007, proceeds from debt included long term debt and commercial paper issuances totaling approximately $4 billion. This was comprised of Eurobond issuances in December 2007 and July 2007 totaling approximately $1.5 billion in U.S. dollars, a March 2007 long term debt issuance of $750 million and a December 2007 fixed rate note issuance of $500 million, plus commercial paper issuances (maturities greater than 90 days) of approximately $1.25 billion. Increases in long term debt were used, in part, to fund share repurchase activities. Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2007, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. In 2008, the Company purchased $1.6 billion in shares. In 2007, the Company accelerated purchases of treasury stock when compared to prior years, buying back $3.2 billion in shares. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $2.6 billion remained available for repurchase. In February 2009, 3Ms Board of Directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining $2.6 billion is fully utilized. For more information, refer to the table titled Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5. 36 Table of Contents Cash dividends paid to stockholders totaled $1.398 billion ($2.00 per share) in 2008, $1.380 billion ($1.92 per share) in 2007 and $1.376 billion ($1.84 per share) in 2006. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2009, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 2.0 percent to 51 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.04 per share. This marked the 51st consecutive year of dividend increases. Other cash flows from financing activities primarily include distributions to minority interests, excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: As of December 31, 2008, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled Warranties/Guarantees in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property. While 3Ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008, follows: Contractual Obligations Payments due by year After (Millions) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2013 Long term debt, including current portion (Note 10) $ 6,058 $ 892 $ 109 $ 899 $ 723 $ 849 $ 2,586 Interest on long term debt 2,944 282 239 238 202 179 1,804 Operating leases (Note 14) 395 111 73 57 32 22 100 Capital leases (Note 14) 69 8 7 7 6 5 36 Unconditional purchase obligations and other 935 622 168 105 21 11 8 Total contractual cash obligations $ 10,401 $ 1,915 $ 596 $ 1,306 $ 984 $ 1,066 $ 4,534 Long term debt payments due in 2009 include $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity 2010) and $62 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2044). These securities are classified as the current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Long term debt payments due in 2010 and 2011 include floating rate notes totaling $85 million and $100 million, respectively, as a result of put provisions. Additionally, payments due in 2012 include the $224 million carrying amount of Convertible Notes, as a result of the put provision. Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending in 2009 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis. Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled Unconditional purchase obligations and other, include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long term portion of the net tax liability of $314 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 8 for further details. 37 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2009 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2009 and future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the Companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2008. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. The model used analyzed 17 currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. Foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased substantially in 2008 primarily due to increases in volatility during 2008, which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model. The decline in interest rate risk of loss or benefit during 2008 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures. Adverse impact on Positive impact on after tax earnings after tax earnings (Millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Foreign exchange rates $ (108 ) $ (54 ) $ 131 $ 57 Interest rates (5 ) (13 ) 5 15 Commodity rates (3 ) (3 ) 2 The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $63 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $42 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7, contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may also make forward looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the Companys representatives may from time to time make oral forward looking statements. Forward looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Companys expected future business and financial performance. Words such as plan, expect, aim, believe, project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward looking statements. In particular, these include statements about the Companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those 38 Table of Contents reflected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the context of Item 7A, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Long Term Debt and Short Term Borrowings, Derivatives, Fair Value Measurements, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The Company does not have leveraged derivative positions. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). 39 Table of Contents
