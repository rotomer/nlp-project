Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3Ms financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3Ms MD&A is presented in eight sections: Overview Results of Operations Performance by Business Segment Performance by Geographic Area Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Pronouncements Financial Condition and Liquidity Financial Instruments OVERVIEW 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Display and Graphics; and Electro and Communications. Fourth quarter 2011 sales totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of 5.7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to 3M was $954 million, or $1.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $928 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. 3Ms sales growth was led by its industrial oriented businesses, along with steady growth in consumer and health care. The business environment remained challenging, impacted by deteriorating demand in Western Europe and slower consumer electronics activity. While sales grew across much of the portfolio, sales of optical films for LCD TVs remained weak and momentum also slowed in other parts of electronics. Four of the Companys six business segments showed growth in sales, led by Industrial and Transportation at 14.3 percent, Safety, Security and Protection Services at 9.4 percent, Consumer and Office at 6.1 percent, and Health Care at 5.4 percent. A slowdown in electronics related businesses negatively impacted both the Electro and Communications and Display and Graphics business segments. Electro and Communications sales decreased 2.7 percent and Display and Graphics sales declined 8.8 percent. Sales declined 17 percent in optical systems, which is part of Display and Graphics, impacted by end market weakness and lower attachment rates in LCD TVs. Fourth quarter 2011 sales increased in every major geographic region, with Latin America/Canada up 9.7 percent, the U.S. up 7.4 percent, Europe/Middle East/Africa up 4.4 percent, and Asia Pacific up 2.8 percent. Excluding optical systems, Asia Pacific sales increased 7.6 percent. Of the 5.7 percent worldwide sales growth, 3.3 points was from the combined impact of higher organic volume of 1.3 points and selling price growth of 2.0 points, 2.3 points was from acquisitions, and 0.1 points was from favorable currency effects. Organic volume growth of 1.3 percent reflected slower growth in Asia Pacific, partially due to weakness across the electronics market and slower growth in China, in addition to weakness in Western Europe. During 2011, 3M was impacted by the first quarter earthquake and tsunami in Japan and by the fourth quarter flooding in Thailand. Automobile and electronic manufacturers were most impacted; thus, 3Ms automotive OEM and electronics related businesses were most affected. 3M estimates that combined direct and indirect business disruption resulting from the 2011 Japan natural disaster, net of the benefit from sales of 3M products used in the reconstruction efforts and initial insurance recoveries, plus the impact of Thailand flooding, reduced 2011 sales growth by an estimated 0.8 percentage points and earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share, with most of this impact in the first half of 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the flooding in Thailand reduced sales growth by an estimated $35 million and operating income by $20 million, with this operating income effect offset by $23 million in insurance recoveries related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Japan represented approximately 9 percent of total 3M sales for total year 2011. As conditions improve, 3M has been working to capture additional sales for its businesses, such as products used in clean up (construction and home improvement products), safety related products (respirator masks and personal protective equipment), energy savings/refurbishment products (window films) and products that help in the rebuilding effort (traffic safety, telecommunication/utility and commercial construction). Related to these natural disasters, based on 3Ms current assessment, no material asset or investment impairments have been recorded. In addition, 3M is not aware of any significant issues related to these natural 14 Table of Contents disasters concerning inventory, customer receivables, lease terminations, environmental exposures, guarantees, indemnifications, debt covenant compliance, or significant tax issues. 3M does have certain insurance coverage which limits its exposure and resulted in some initial recovery in the fourth quarter of 2011 (as discussed above). Sales in 2011 increased 11.1 percent to $29.6 billion, led by Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services, and Health Care. All major geographic regions showed improvement, led by Latin America/Canada. The increase in global sales reflected improved market penetration and new product flow along with significant growth in important end markets such as general industrial and personal safety. Net income attributable to 3M was $4.283 billion, or $5.96 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $4.085 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, in 2010 (including the first quarter 2010 special item discussed below). Fourth quarter 2010 sales grew nearly 10 percent to $6.7 billion, despite negative comparisons from H1N1 and moderating sales growth in optical films for LCD TVs. Sales growth was broad based, with organic sales volumes expanding in all businesses, led by an 18.7 percent increase in Electro and Communications and a 14.7 percent increase in Display and Graphics. Geographically, organic sales volume was strongest in Asia Pacific at 18.1 percent and Latin America at 12.2 percent. Net income attributable to 3M in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $928 million, or $1.28 per diluted shares, compared to $935 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter income was penalized by year on year H1N1 related comparisons, increases in raw material costs, and investments to accelerate future growth. 3M invested in research and development, sales and marketing (including advertising and merchandising investments), and also incurred acquisition related costs in the fourth quarter. 3M made several large fourth quarter 2010 acquisitions, including Arizant Inc., Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. For total year 2010, the Company posted 2010 sales of $26.7 billion, up 15.3 percent. During the year, 3M invested significantly to improve long term growth. For example, research, development and related expenses of $1.4 billion helped to drive innovation and new product sales. 3M also accelerated sales and marketing investments in high growth markets to help secure future growth. All businesses posted positive organic volume growth, led by Display and Graphics at 26.5 percent, Electro and Communications at 26.0 percent, and Industrial and Transportation at 16.6 percent. Including special items (discussed below), net income attributable to 3M in 2010 was $4.085 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.193 billion or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2009. In 2010, 3M recorded a one time, non cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. 3M has been aggressively restructuring the company since early 2008 and continued this effort through the third quarter of 2009, with these restructuring actions and exit activities resulting in an aggregate reduction of approximately 6,400 positions. The related net restructuring charges and other special items reduced net income attributable to 3M for year 2009 by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. These restructuring actions and exit activities resulted in savings of almost $400 million in 2009 and additional incremental savings of more than $150 million in 2010, with the majority of 2010s benefit in the first half of the year. In addition, 3M amended its policy regarding banked vacation in 2009, which added more than $100 million to operating income in 2009, with a benefit of approximately $80 million in 2010. The following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. In addition to the discussion below, refer to the section entitled Performance by Business Segment and Performance by Geographic Area later in MD&A for a more detailed discussion of the sales and income results of the Company and its respective business segments (including Corporate and Unallocated). Refer to Note 17 for additional information on business segments, including Elimination of Dual Credit. 15 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2011 vs. 2010 % change (Dollars in millions) Net Sales % of Total Oper.

Electro and Communications sales increased 8.6 percent and Consumer and Office sales increased 7.8 percent. Sales declined 5.4 percent in Display and Graphics, due to fewer orders for optical films. Total company local currency sales growth (which includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes divestiture and translation impacts) was 8.0 percent and foreign currency impacts added 3.1 percent. 3Ms business segments all posted operating income margins in excess of 20 percent in 2011 and 2010. Worldwide operating income margins for 2011 were 20.9 percent, compared to 22.2 percent for 2010. In 2010, sales increased 15.3 percent, led by Electro and Communications at 27.5 percent, Display and Graphics at 24.0 percent, Industrial and Transportation at 18.4 percent, and Consumer and Office at 11.0 percent. Sales growth in these business segments was led by consumer electronics, automotive OEM, renewable energy, and broad based consumer and office growth, as well as sales growth in those businesses that serve the broad industrial manufacturing sector. Local currency sales (which includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes divestiture and translation impacts) increased 14.4 percent. Foreign currency effects added 1.0 percent to sales, while divestiture impacts reduced sales by 0.1 percent. Operating income margins for 2010 were 22.2 percent, compared to 20.8 percent in 2009. 3M generated approximately $5.3 billion of operating cash flows in 2011, an increase of $110 million when compared to 2010. This followed an increase of $233 million when comparing 2010 to 2009. Refer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2011, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, which replaced the Companys previous repurchase program. The current authorization has no pre established end date. In 2011, the Company purchased $2.701 billion of treasury stock, of which a portion was under the previous authorization, compared to $854 million of treasury stock repurchases in 2010. In 2009, the Company placed added emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength. As a result, share repurchase activity was minimal and no broker repurchases of stock were made. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $4.6 billion of 3M common stock remained available for repurchase under the current authorization. In February 2012, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 7.3 percent for 2012, marking the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3Ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 25 percent at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, compared to 30 percent at December 31, 2009. 3M has an AA credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors and an Aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service. The Company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital markets to meet its funding needs. In 2011, the Company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. This was driven by higher basic feedstock costs, including petroleum based materials, metals, minerals and woodpulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. 16 Table of Contents On a worldwide basis, 3Ms pension and postretirement plans were 82 percent funded at year end 2011. The U.S. qualified plans, which are approximately 71 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, were 86 percent funded, the international pension plans were 87 percent funded, and the U.S. non qualified pension plan is not funded. Asset returns in 2011 for the U.S. qualified plan were 8.7%. The year end 2011 discount rate was 4.15%, down 1.08 percentage points from the 2010 discount rate of 5.23%. The decrease in discount rates, both U.S. and internationally, resulted in a significantly higher valuation of the projected benefit obligation, which reduced the plans funded status. The changes in 3Ms defined benefit pension and postretirement plans funded status significantly impacted several balance sheet lines. These changes increased long term liabilities by approximately $2.4 billion and decreased stockholders equity by approximately $1.6 billion, with the other major impact primarily related to increased deferred taxes within other assets. Other pension and postretirement changes during the year, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet captions. 3M expects to contribute approximately $800 million to $1 billion of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2012, with approximately $300 million in each of the first and second quarters. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2012. 3M expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2012 to increase by approximately $89 million pre tax, or approximately 9 cents per diluted share, when compared to 2011. This 9 cents per diluted share increase includes the costs associated with a voluntary incentive program (discussed in next paragraph). Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within MD&A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3Ms pension and post retirement plans. 3M expects to incur early retirement/restructuring costs of approximately 4 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. Of this amount, approximately 3 cents per diluted share relates to special termination benefits for the voluntary retirement incentive program in the United States (discussed in Note 11). The remainder relates to selective restructuring in a few developed countries. These actions, in aggregate, are expected to be neutral to full year 2012 earnings, with the costs incurred in the first quarter of 2012, and the associated benefits realized over the remainder of 2012. There are a few major items that will negatively impact earnings in 2012. As discussed further above, 3M expects that pension and postretirement expense will decrease 2012 earnings, when compared to 2011, by approximately 9 cents per diluted share. 3Ms early assessment of the income tax rate indicates an expected 2012 effective tax rate of approximately 29.5 percent compared to 27.8 percent for 2011. In addition, currency effects are expected to have a negative impact on earnings. 3M currently expects that sales growth and related incremental income, in addition to expected productivity improvements, selling price increases in excess of raw material inflation, and other benefits, should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings. Forward looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). Special Items: Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in the Companys underlying operations. In 2010, 3M recorded a one time, non cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act). The charge is due to a reduction in the value of the companys deferred tax asset as a result of the Acts change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements. This item is discussed in more detail in Note 8 (Income Taxes). In 2009, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $194 million and net income attributable to 3M by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. 2009 included restructuring actions ($209 million pre tax, $128 million after tax and noncontrolling interest), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($15 million pre tax, $9 million after tax). The gain on sale of real estate relates to the June 2009 sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility, which is recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment. Restructuring is discussed in more detail in Note 4 (Restructuring Actions). 17 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales: 2011 2010 U.S. Intl. Worldwide U.S. Intl.

All major geographic areas showed local currency sales increases, led by Latin America/Canada and the United States. Worldwide local currency sales growth was led by Industrial and Transportation at 15.9 percent, Safety, Security and Protection Services at 11.8 percent, and Health Care at 8.4 percent. Acquisitions added 3.3 percent to worldwide growth and currency impacts benefited 2011 worldwide sales growth by 3.1 percent. Worldwide selling prices rose 1.0 percent in 2011, despite selling price declines in 3Ms optical systems business, where prices typically decline each year, which is common for the electronics industry. Selling prices in 3Ms non optical systems businesses increased by approximately 1.6 percent. In 2010, local currency sales increased 14.4 percent. All major geographic areas showed local currency sales increases, led by Asia Pacific. Worldwide local currency sales growth was led by Electro and Communications at 26.1 percent, Display and Graphics at 23 percent, Industrial and Transportation at 17.2 percent and Consumer and Office at 10 percent. Refer to the sections entitled Performance by Business Segment and Performance by Geographic Area later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change. Operating Expenses: (Percent of net sales) 2011 2010 2009 2011 Versus 2010 2010 Versus 2009 Cost of sales 53.0 % 51.9 % 52.4 % 1.1 % (0.5 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 20.8 20.5 21.2 0.3 (0.7 ) Research, development and related expenses 5.3 5.4 5.6 (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Operating income 20.9 % 22.2 % 20.8 % (1.3 )% 1.4 % As discussed in the preceding overview section, 2009 included restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by $194 million, or 0.9 percent of net sales. There were no special items that impacted operating income in 2011 or 2010. The following tables summarize the 2009 special items by income statement caption. 2009 Restructuring and Other Summary (Millions) Restructuring actions Gain on sale of real estate Total Cost of sales $ 110 $ (15 ) $ 95 Selling, general and administrative expenses 91 91 Research, development and related expenses 8 8 Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ 209 $ (15 ) $ 194 18 Table of Contents Pension and postretirement expense increased in both 2011 and 2010. The year on year increase for 2011 compared to 2010, and 2010 compared to 2009, was $233 million and $99 million, respectively. These increases negatively impacted cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 53.0 percent in 2011, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from 2010 levels. On a dollar basis, selling price increases largely offset raw material inflation for total year 2011, as selling prices increased 1 percent year on year and gross raw material prices increased approximately 4 percent year on year. However, measured as a percent of sales, selling price/gross raw material impacts accounted for approximately 0.5 percentage points of the cost of sales increase. As discussed in the preceding paragraph, cost of sales as a percent of net sales was also negatively impacted by higher pension and postretirement costs. These impacts were partially offset by organic sales volume growth of 3.7 percent. Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.9 percent in 2010, a decrease of 0.5 percentage points from 2009. A number of positive factors impacted year on year results. These factors included 13.7 percent growth in organic sales volume, improved factory utilization levels, along with cost savings related to prior years restructuring actions. In addition, 2009 included a penalty of 0.5 percentage points (as a percent of net sales) related to special items. As discussed in Note 4 (Restructuring Actions), in 2009, 3M recorded $209 million in restructuring charges, of which $110 million was recorded in cost of sales. This was partially offset by a $15 million gain on sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility, which was also recorded in cost of sales. In addition, 3M decided to swap Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars in 2009, given the economic conditions in Venezuela at that time, which also negatively impacted cost of sales in 2009. These year on year net benefits were partially offset by pricing impacts, as selling prices declined 0.2 percent year on year, and gross raw material prices increased approximately 2 percent year on year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13 percent in 2011 when compared to 2010, due to several factors. Approximately 5 percentage points of this growth in SG&A was due to increases from businesses acquired in the last twelve months, primarily related to SG&A spending for the Winterthur Technologie AG, Arizant Inc., Cogent Inc. and Attenti Holdings S.A. acquisitions. Another 3 percentage points of growth in 2011 SG&A was due to foreign exchange effects, which resulted in higher translated costs from 3Ms non U.S. subsidiaries. Finally, 2011 SG&A increased in part due to higher year on year pension and postretirement expense and continued investments to support future growth, such as sales representatives, advertising and promotional investments. SG&A expenses, measured as a percent of net sales, increased 0.3 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 12 percent in 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2010, sales and marketing expenses increased 14 percent, which included advertising and promotion investment increases of over 20 percent in 2010, which helped drive sales volumes. In addition, 3M increased both sales coverage and its marketing strength, particularly in faster growing emerging economies. In 2010, general and administrative costs remained under control, as these costs increased at approximately half the rate of 2010 sales growth. SG&A expenses, measured as a percent of net sales, decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009. As indicated in Note 4, restructuring expenses of $91 million were recorded in SG&A expenses in 2009. Measured as a percent of sales, these restructuring expenses increased 2009 SG&A expenses by 0.4 percentage points. Research, Development and Related Expenses: Research, development and related expenses (R&D) expense increased 9.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased 11 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, as 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives. In 2011, R&D expense increased versus 2010 due to R&D related to businesses acquired in the last 12 months, foreign exchange effects, and higher pension and postretirement expense, in addition to 3Ms continued investment in new products. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.3 percent in 2011, compared to 5.4 percent in 2010 and 5.6 percent in 2009. Operating Income: 3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income was 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, compared to 22.2 percent of sales in 2010, primarily due to higher cost of 19 Table of Contents sales (as a percent of sales) in 2011 when compared to 2010. Operating income was 20.8 percent of sales in 2009. 2009 was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, net of a gain on sale of real estate, which on a combined basis decreased operating income by 0.9 percentage points ($194 million). Interest Expense and Income: (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 186 $ 201 $ 219 Interest income (39 ) (38 ) (37 ) Total $ 147 $ 163 $ 182 Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased in both 2011 and 2010, driven by lower average U.S. debt balances and lower interest rates. Interest Income: In 2011, interest income increased slightly, as higher international cash balances and better investment yields were largely offset by a lower U.S. cash balance. In 2010, interest income also increased slightly, with higher average cash and cash equivalent balances largely offset by lower interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes: (Percent of pre tax income) 2011 2010 2009 Effective tax rate 27.8 % 27.7 % 30.0 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.8 percent, compared to 27.7 percent in 2010, an increase of 0.1 percent. The year on year change in international income taxes increased the effective tax rate for 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 2.5 percent, which includes a partial offsetting benefit from the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary in 2011. This 2.5 percent net increase was due primarily to certain 2010 tax benefits, which did not repeat in 2011, related to net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance resulting from the 2010 corporate alignment transactions that allowed the Company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary. These transactions are described in the section of Note 6 entitled Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Shares and Transfers of Ownership Interests Involving Non Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. Other significant items impacting the year on year comparison include a one time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million, which benefited the 2011 tax rate when compared to 2010 by 1.5 percent, as this charge did not repeat in 2011. This 2010 charge was a result of the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The Companys effective tax rate also benefited during 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 0.7 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.7 percent, compared to 30.0 percent in 2009, a decrease of 2.3 percent. This included an approximately 1.8 percent decrease related to the year on year change in international income taxes, due primarily to the corporate alignment transactions discussed above. Additionally, the Companys effective tax rate benefited in 2010 compared to 2009 by approximately 1.3 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves, and by approximately 0.9 percent from additional Domestic Manufacturers deductions. These benefits were partially offset by a 1.5 percent increase related to the one time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million. On December 17, 2010, the provision for the research and development credit was extended by the 2010 Tax Relief Act for expenditures incurred up to December 31, 2011. The expiration of this research and development credit will have a negative impact on the effective tax rate in 2012 and forward if this credit is not extended in future years. The company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2012 will be approximately 29.5 percent. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. Refer to Note 8 for further discussion of income taxes. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest $ 74 $ 78 $ 51 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non 3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily 20 Table of Contents related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which is 3Ms most significant consolidated entity with non 3M ownership interests. As of December 31, 2011, 3Ms effective ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited is 75 percent. Currency Effects: 3M estimates that year on year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $154 million in 2011 and increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $15 million in 2010. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year on year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an immaterial impact on net income attributable to 3M in 2011 and decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $115 million in 2010. PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. The reportable segments are Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Display and Graphics; and Electro and Communications. Information related to 3Ms business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Local currency sales change amounts are separated into organic local currency sales (which include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts) and acquisition impacts. The divestiture impact, translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each segment. In addition to these six operating business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to Corporate and Unallocated, which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 17. Corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under or over absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. The primary item driving higher 2011 expenses when compared to 2010 relates to pension and postretirement expense, as a portion of the 2011 increase in these expenses was not allocated directly to the six operating business segments. The primary items driving higher 2010 expenses when compared to 2009 relates to increased pension and postretirement expense, in addition to increased stock based compensation expense. As discussed in the preceding overview and results of operations section, the combination of restructuring actions and other special items significantly impacted 2009 results. There were no special items that impacted operating income in 2011 or 2010. The following table summarizes special items by business segment. 2009 Restructuring and Other Summary (Millions) Restructuring actions Gain on sale of real estate Total Industrial and Transportation $ 89 $ $ 89 Health Care 20 20 Consumer and Office 13 13 Safety, Security and Protection Services 16 (15 ) 1 Display and Graphics 22 22 Electro and Communications 11 11 Corporate and Unallocated 38 38 Total operating income penalty (benefit) $ 209 $ (15 ) $ 194 The following discusses total year results for 2011 compared to 2010, and also discusses 2010 compared to 2009, for each business segment. 21 Table of Contents Industrial and Transportation Business (34.0% of consolidated sales): 2011 2010 2009 Sales (millions) $ 10,073 $ 8,429 $ 7,120 Sales change analysis: Organic local currency sales (volume and price) 10.0 % 17.0 % (12.8 )% Acquisitions 5.9 0.2 2.6 Local currency sales 15.9 % 17.2 % (10.2 )% Translation 3.6 1.2 (2.7 ) Total sales change 19.5 % 18.4 % (12.9 )% Operating income (millions) $ 2,057 $ 1,754 $ 1,230 Percent change 17.3 % 42.6 % (19.9 )% Percent of sales 20.4 % 20.8 % 17.3 % The Industrial and Transportation segment serves a broad range of markets, such as automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and automotive aftermarket (auto body shops and retail), renewable energy, electronics, paper and packaging, food and beverage, and appliance. Industrial and Transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, energy control products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. Year 2011 results: Sales in Industrial and Transportation increased 19.5 percent to $10.1 billion. In local currency terms, sales increased 15.9 percent, with 10.0 percent of this increase attributable to organic local currency growth. Acquisitions increased sales by 5.9 percent, primarily driven by Winterthur and Alpha Beta (discussed below). Foreign currency impacts added 3.6 percent to 2011 sales growth. Geographically, local currency sales increased in all major regions, led by Asia Pacific and Europe. Local currency sales growth was broad based across the portfolio, led by abrasives systems, renewable energy, aerospace and aircraft maintenance, industrial adhesives and tapes, and energy and advanced materials. In addition, despite the Japan and Thailand natural disasters, 3M also achieved growth in its automotive aftermarket and automotive OEM businesses. 3M continues to invest in its Industrial and Transportation business. In March 2011, 3M acquired a controlling interest in Winterthur via completion of a public tender offer. Winterthur, based in Zug, Switzerland, is a leading global supplier of precision grinding technology serving customers in the area of hard to grind precision applications in industrial, automotive, aircraft, and cutting tools. In addition, in February 2011, 3M completed its acquisition of the tape related assets of Alpha Beta, a leading manufacturer of box sealing tape and masking tape headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. Operating income was $2.1 billion in 2011, 17.3 percent higher than 2010. 3M achieved operating income margins of 20.4 percent, even with continued investments to support growth. Year 2010 results: Sales in Industrial and Transportation increased 18.4 percent to $8.4 billion. In local currency terms, sales increased 17.2 percent, driven almost entirely by organic volume. Foreign currency impacts added 1.2 percent to 2010 sales growth. Geographically, local currency sales growth increased in all major geographic regions, led by Asia Pacific. Local currency sales growth was broad based across the portfolio, led by renewable energy, automotive OEM, energy and advanced materials, aerospace, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes. Operating income increased 43 percent to $1.8 billion in 2010, with operating income margins of 20.8 percent. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $89 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee related liabilities for severance and benefits of $84 million and fixed asset impairments of $5 million. Investment: In March 2005, 3Ms automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of TI&M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&M) for approximately $55 million. TI&M is the parent company of I&T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a 22 Table of Contents Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed the firms flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&M, the Company was granted a put option, which gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&M to the other investors from whom 3M acquired its 19 percent interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&M investors from whom 3M purchased its shares have filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria. The Company has recovered approximately 6.7 million Euros through this bankruptcy process, which in addition to prior recoveries, results in a remaining investment balance of approximately 12 million Euros (approximately $15 million) as of December 31, 2011. The Company is pursuing recovery of the balance of its investment, first, from the bank that held the 3M purchase price paid to the two bankrupt investors and, to the extent not made whole, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded. Health Care Business (17.0% of consolidated sales): 2011 2010 2009 Sales (millions) $ 5,031 $ 4,513 $ 4,282 Sales change analysis: Organic local currency sales (volume and price) 4.6 % 4.1 % 2.7 % Acquisitions 3.8 1.2 0.9 Local currency sales 8.4 % 5.3 % 3.6 % Divestitures (0.2 ) Translation 3.1 0.3 (3.9 ) Total sales change 11.5 % 5.4 % (0.3 )% Operating income (millions) $ 1,489 $ 1,362 $ 1,347 Percent change 9.3 % 1.1 % 14.9 % Percent of sales 29.6 % 30.2 % 31.4 % The Health Care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information systems. Products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, inhalation and transdermal drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products (oral care), health information systems, and food safety products. Year 2011 results: Health Care sales increased 11.5 percent to $5.0 billion. Local currency sales increased 8.4 percent, including 3.8 percent from acquisitions. Acquisition growth primarily related to Arizant Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia in surgical settings. Currency impacts increased sales by 3.1 percent in Health Care. On a geographic basis, all regions posted positive sales growth. Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and Europe all reported sales growth of 10 percent or more, while the U.S. grew at 9 percent. Local currency sales growth was led by the infection prevention, health information systems, food safety, skin and wound care, and oral care businesses. Sales in the drug delivery systems business increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, but were down slightly for total year 2011 when compared to 2010. Operating income in Health Care increased 9.3 percent in 2011 to $1.5 billion. Operating income margins were 29.6 percent, compared to 30.2 percent in 2010, with this decrease due in part to growth investments in the health information systems and infection prevention businesses. 3M has also been investing in emerging markets over the past couple of years to improve market penetration levels. The year on year decline in operating income margins was also due in part to sales declines in drug delivery systems. 3Ms long term expectation is that Health Care operating income margins will be in the high 20s, as 3M continues to invest to grow this business. Year 2010 results: Health Care local currency sales increased 5.3 percent, including a benefit of 1.2 percent from acquisitions, primarily related to the Arizant Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter (discussed above). Currency impacts increased sales by 0.3 percent. On a geographic basis, all regions posted positive local currency sales growth, led by Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada. Local currency sales growth was broad based, led by skin and wound care, drug delivery systems, health information systems, infection prevention and oral care. 23 Table of Contents Operating income increased 1.1 percent to $1.4 billion, and operating income margins were 30.2 percent. Health Care recorded charges of $20 million related to restructuring actions in 2009, with this charge comprised of employee related liabilities for severance and benefits. Lower year on year H1N1 related sales penalized both sales and operating income in 2010. Consumer and Office Business (14.0% of consolidated sales): 2011 2010 2009 Sales (millions) $ 4,153 $ 3,853 $ 3,471 Sales change analysis: Organic local currency sales (volume and price) 4.0 7.1 % (3.1 )% Acquisitions 1.4 2.9 2.6 Local currency sales 5.4 % 10.0 % (0.5 )% Translation 2.4 1.0 (2.5 ) Total sales change 7.8 % 11.0 % (3.0 )% Operating income (millions) $ 840 $ 840 $ 748 Percent change % 12.3 % 9.5 % Percent of sales 20.2 % 21.8 % 21.5 % The Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, home improvement, building maintenance and other markets. Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products (do it yourself), home care products, protective material products, certain consumer retail personal safety products, and consumer health care products. Year 2011 results: Sales in Consumer and Office increased 7.8 percent in 2011 to $4.2 billion, with all businesses posting positive sales growth. Local currency sales increased 5.4 percent, which included 4.0 percent from organic growth and 1.4 percent from acquisitions. Acquisition growth was largely due to the October 2011 acquisition of the do it yourself and professional business of GPI Group and the April 2010 acquisition of the A One branded label business and related operations. GPI is a manufacturer and marketer of home improvement products such as tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products and accessories. The addition of GPIs products will expand 3Ms product portfolio in core and complementary categories in the construction and home improvement markets. A One is the largest branded label business in Asia and the second largest worldwide. 3M also acquired Hybrivet Systems Inc. in the first quarter of 2011, a provider of instant read products to detect lead and other contaminants and toxins. Foreign currency impacts contributed 2.4 percent to sales growth in the Consumer and Office segment. On a geographic basis, sales increased in all regions, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada and Europe, which all had sales growth rates in excess of 10 percent. U.S. sales also grew, albeit at a slower rate. Consumer and Office operating income was flat when comparing 2011 to 2010, reflecting continued ongoing investments in developing economies in brand development and marketing and sales coverage. Even with these investments, Consumer and Office generated operating income margins of 20.2 percent. In December 2011, 3M entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Office and Consumer Products business of Avery Dennison Corp. for a total purchase price of approximately $550 million, subject to certain adjustments. The Office and Consumer Products business of Avery Dennison is a leading supplier of office and education products, including labels, binders, presentation products, filing and indexing products, writing instruments, and other office and home organization products. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012, subject to customary closing conditions including any necessary regulatory approvals. Year 2010 results: Sales in Consumer and Office increased 11.0 percent in 2010 to $3.9 billion. Local currency sales increased 10.0 percent, which included 7.1 percent from organic growth and 2.9 percent from acquisitions. Acquisition growth for 2010 was primarily comprised of the July 2009 acquisition of ACE and related brands, which sells elastic bandage, supports and thermometer product lines through consumer channels in North America, and the April 2010 acquisition of the A One branded label business (discussed above). In addition, the January 2010 acquisition of Incavas Industria de Cabos e Vassouras Ltda., a manufacturer of floor care products, contributed to acquisition sales growth. Foreign currency impacts added 1.0 percent to sales growth. 24 Table of Contents 2010 sales growth was broad based, led by office supply products, consumer health care, home care, do it yourself products and stationery products. On a geographic basis, sales growth was led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada and the United States. Consumer and Office operating income increased 12.3 percent to $840 million, with operating income margins of 21.8 percent. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $13 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee related liabilities for severance and benefits. Safety, Security and Protection Services Business (12.9% of consolidated sales): 2011 2010 2009 Sales (millions) $ 3,821 $ 3,316 $ 3,076 Sales change analysis: Organic local currency sales (volume and price) 7.1 6.1 (4.9 ) Acquisitions 4.7 1.2 2.3 Local currency sales 11.8 % 7.3 % (2.6 )% Divestitures (0.9 ) Translation 3.4 0.5 (4.4 ) Total sales change 15.2 % 7.8 % (7.9 )% Operating income (millions) $ 814 $ 709 $ 728 Percent change 14.9 % (2.6 )% 5.2 % Percent of sales 21.3 % 21.4 % 23.7 % The Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, safety and security products (including border and civil security solutions), roofing granules for asphalt shingles, corrosion protection products used in the oil and gas pipeline markets, and track and trace solutions. 3Ms Track and Trace Solutions utilize radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to provide a growing array of solutions. Year 2011 results: Safety, Security and Protection Services sales increased 15.2 percent in 2011. H1N1 related comparisons reduced 2011 sales growth by 2.5 percent, as 3M generated sales related to the H1N1 virus in the first three quarters of 2010. Even with this difficult comparison, local currency sales growth was 11.8 percent, which included 4.7 percent growth from acquisitions. The acquisition benefit primarily related to Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. (which are discussed further below). Foreign currency effects added 3.4 percent to 2011 sales. All geographic regions posted positive sales growth, with sales growth led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and the U.S. These three regions all had local currency sales growth in excess of 15 percent. Local currency sales increased in all businesses. Sales dollar increases were largest in personal protection products, security systems, track and trace, building and commercial services, and corrosion protection. Sales growth in personal protection products, or more specifically, respiratory products, was hampered by H1N1 related comparisons, partially offset by some modest additional sales of personal protective equipment related to the cleanup efforts in Japan. Operating income for 2011 rose 14.9 percent to $814 million. 3M achieved a 21.3 percent operating income margin, despite H1N1 related comparisons that negatively impacted results. Year 2010 results: Safety, Security and Protection Services sales increased 7.8 percent in 2010. Local currency sales growth was 7.3 percent, which included a 1.2 percent benefit from acquisitions. Foreign exchange impacts added 0.5 percent to sales. The acquisition benefit primarily related to two fourth quarter 2010 acquisitions, namely Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. Attenti Holdings S.A. is a supplier of remote people monitoring technologies used for offender monitoring applications and to assist eldercare facilities in monitoring and enhancing the safety of patients. Cogent Inc. is a provider of finger, palm, face and iris biometric systems for governments, law enforcement agencies, and commercial enterprises. 25 Table of Contents 3Ms security systems business led 2010 sales growth, helped by strong organic volume and acquisition growth (Cogent Inc.) that drove local currency growth of nearly 50 percent. Corrosion protection products, track and trace products (helped by acquisition growth related to Attenti Holdings S.A.) and building and commercial services also were strong contributors to sales growth. Sales of personal protection products increased in 2010, despite negative year on year impacts from H1N1. Industrial minerals sales also increased for the year, helped by a strong fourth quarter of 2010. Geographically, local currency sales growth was broad based, led by Latin America and Asia Pacific. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales growth was led by Central East Europe and Middle East/Africa. Operating income for 2010 was $709 million, with a 21.4 percent operating income margin. Operating income declined 2.6 percent, penalized by year on year H1N1 related comparisons, which reduced Safety, Security and Protection Services sales growth rates by approximately 6 percent year on year. In addition, fourth quarter 2010 acquisition related costs also penalized operating income. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $16 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee related liabilities for severance and benefits. This charge was largely offset by a gain of $15 million related to the sale of 3Ms New Jersey roofing granule facility. In June 2009, 3Ms Security Systems Division was notified that the UK government decided to award its passport production to a competitor upon the expiration of 3Ms existing UK passport contract in October 2010.

This segment includes optical film solutions for LCD electronic displays; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; commercial graphics sheeting and systems; architectural surface and lighting solutions; and mobile interactive solutions, including mobile display technology, visual systems products, and computer privacy filters. The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones and tablets 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3Ms optical film patents begin to expire in the next few years, 3M will likely see more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3Ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents. Year 2011 results: Sales in Display and Graphics were $3.7 billion in 2011, a decline of 5.4 percent in U.S. dollars. Sales in local currency declined 7.4 percent, which was largely organic. Foreign currency impacts increased sales by 2.0 percent. Optical Systems sales decreased 17 percent due to lower year on year LCD TV related sales over the last three quarters of 2011. Sales grew in commercial graphics and architectural markets. Traffic safety systems also posted sales growth, which was all currency related. Sales increased in Latin America/Canada and the U.S., but declined in Europe. Sales also declined in Asia Pacific, where the decline in optical systems sales was a major factor. Operating income in 2011 totaled $788 million, down 16.6 percent from 2010. 3M achieved 21.5 percent operating income margins in this business segment, as productivity improvements helped to partially offset negative impacts 26 Table of Contents from lower sales of optical films for LCD TVs, impacted by LCD TV volume reductions, as well as continued LCD selling price declines. Year 2010 results: Sales in Display and Graphics were $3.9 billion, up 24.0 percent year on year. Sales increased 23.0 percent in local currencies, which was entirely organic. Foreign currency impacts increased sales growth by 1.0 percent. Sales rose in all businesses, with the strongest growth in 3Ms optical systems and commercial graphics businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2010, while sales growth moderated in optical films for LCD TVs, local currency sales were still up more than 10 percent year on year. Sales in 2010 were up slightly in the traffic safety systems business and mobile interactive solutions division, which focuses on products that improve projection, personalization and privacy for mobile device users. Geographically, sales growth was led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and the United States. Operating income in 2010 totaled $946 million, or 24.4 percent of sales. In 2009, this business segment recorded net charges of $22 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee related liabilities for severance and benefits and fixed asset impairments.

Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, micro interconnect systems, high performance fluids, high temperature and display tapes, telecommunications products, electrical products, and touch screens and touch monitors. Year 2011 results: Electro and Communications sales were $3.3 billion in 2011, an increase of 8.6 percent in U.S. dollars and 5.3 percent in local currency. Foreign currency impacts added 3.3 percent to 2011 sales growth. Sales expanded in all geographic regions, led by greater than 10 percent sales increases in both Europe and Latin America/Canada. From a business standpoint, sales growth was led by 3Ms electronics markets materials business and the electrical markets business. The telecom business also posted solid sales growth, while sales declined in the electronic solutions business. Operating income increased 6.2 percent to $712 million in 2011, driven by higher year on year sales growth. Operating income margins were 21.5 percent, slightly lower than 2010. Year 2010 results: Electro and Communications sales were $3.0 billion in 2010, an increase of 27.5 percent in U.S. dollars and 26.1 percent in local currency. Foreign currency impacts added 1.8 percent to 2010 sales growth, while divestiture impacts reduced sales by 0.4 percent. Sales expanded in all geographic regions, led by Asia Pacific and the United States. Sales growth was led by the electronics markets materials, electronic solutions and touch systems 27 Table of Contents businesses, which each had local currency sales growth of greater than 25 percent. 3M also saw strong growth in the electrical markets business. 3Ms telecom infrastructure related business increased slightly year on year. Operating income was $670 million in 2010, or 22.0 percent of sales, which was significantly improved versus 2009 as the consumer electronic related businesses showed significant year on year improvements. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $11 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee related liabilities for severance and benefits. PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3Ms results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18. Operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items. In 2009, restructuring actions, partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $194 million, with the largest impact in Europe, Asia Pacific and the United States.

Geographic Area Supplemental Information (Millions, Employees as of December 31, Capital Spending Property, Plant and Equipment net except Employees) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 United States 33,128 32,955 31,513 $ 688 $ 569 $ 464 $ 3,979 $ 3,888 Asia Pacific 18,015 16,324 13,834 409 290 215 1,887 1,605 Europe, Middle East and Africa 20,113 18,120 17,743 180 151 162 1,271 1,239 Latin America and Canada 12,942 12,658 11,745 102 81 62 529 547 Total Company 84,198 80,057 74,835 $ 1,379 $ 1,091 $ 903 $ 7,666 $ 7,279 Employment: At December 31, 2011, employment increased by 4,141 positions since year end 2010, largely driven by acquisitions (estimated 2,250 full time equivalents) and additions in developing economies. At December 31, 2010, employment increased by 5,222 positions since year end 2009, largely driven by acquisitions (estimated 1,850 full time equivalents) and additions in developing economies. Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: Capital expenditures were $1.379 billion in 2011, compared to $1.091 billion in 2010 and $903 million in 2009. The Company expects 2012 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 to $1.5 billion as 3M continues to invest in capacity for future growth. In 2011, a large portion of the investment is addressing supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. In addition, spending on some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. In 2010, in the U.S., 3M invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non optical businesses which use similar technology. In 2010, 3M also increased capacity at its multi purpose manufacturing facility in Singapore and invested in optical film capacity in Korea. Lastly, in 2010, investments in the Industrial and Transportation business included solar energy in the U.S. and industrial adhesives and tapes in China. 29 Table of Contents In 2009, in response to then difficult global economic conditions, the Company reduced its capital spending significantly. 3M is striving to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capacity outside the United States in order to more closely align its production capability with its sales in major geographic regions. The initiative is expected to help improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Companys pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors. Legal Proceedings: The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Legal Proceedings in Note 14) for additional information about such estimates. Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The U.S. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.15% for U.S. pension and 4.04% for U.S. postretirement benefits to be appropriate as of December 31, 2011, which represents a decrease from the 5.23% and 5.09% rates, respectively, used as of December 31, 2010. The weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of December 31, 2011 was 4.58%, a decrease from the 5.04% rate used as of December 31, 2010. 30 Table of Contents A significant element in determining the Companys pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, the 2012 expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2012 is 8.25%, a 0.25% decrease from 2011. Refer to Note 11 for information on how the 2012 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan by plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 6.38% for 2012, compared to 6.58% for 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $555 million, up from $322 million in 2010. Pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $644 million in 2012, an increase of $89 million compared to 2011. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease/increase 2012 pension expense by approximately $30 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $12 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2012 pension expense by approximately $37 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $16 million for international pension plans. In addition, a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2012 pension expense by approximately $39 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $19 million for international pension plans. Asset Impairments: As of December 31, 2011, net property, plant and equipment totaled $7.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.9 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Impairments recorded in 2009 related to restructuring actions are discussed in Note 4. In June 2009, 3Ms Security Systems Division (within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment) was notified that the UK government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3Ms existing UK passport contracts in October 2010. As a result of this event, in June 2009, 3M tested the long lived assets associated with the UK passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives. In addition, 3M tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit (Security Systems Division) level. The result of the June 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the UK passport activity indicated that the asset groupings carrying amount of approximately $54 million (before impairment) exceeded the remaining expected cash flows. Accordingly, 3M recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately $13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value. In addition, accelerated depreciation/amortization was taken over the period June 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets. 3M goodwill totaled approximately $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2011. 3Ms annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3M has six business segments at December 31, 2011), but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. 31 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments. For those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2011 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time. As of September 30, 2011, 3M had 38 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 76 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M Purification Inc., Occupational Health and Environmental Safety, Optical Systems, Infection Prevention, Security Systems, 3M ESPE, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Communication Markets, Abrasive Systems and Health Information Systems. The fair values for 3M Purification Inc. and Optical Systems, based on fourth quarter 2011 testing, were both in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent, while Security Systems was in excess of carrying value by 38 percent, all with no impairment indicated. As part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3M used a weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for these divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on managements estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. The fair values for all other significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 40 percent. In 2011, 3M primarily used an industry price earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. Goodwill is testing for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year. Based on fourth quarter 2011 testing, 3Ms estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately $68 billion, implying a control premium of 35 percent when compared to 3Ms market value of approximately $50 billion at September 30, 2011. At December 31, 2011, 3Ms market value was approximately $57 billion, implying a control premium of 19 percent. The control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3Ms total Company estimated fair value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total Company. 3Ms market value at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $17 billion and $16 billion, respectively. 3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus; many of 3Ms businesses could not easily be sold on a stand alone basis. Based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2011, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. Factors which could result in future impairment charges, among others, include changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this document. As of December 31, 2011, 3M had approximately $1 billion of goodwill related to 3M Purification Inc., $750 million related to Optical Systems and $500 million related to Security Systems. If future non cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2012 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. Income Taxes: The extent of 3Ms operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Companys current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Companys estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. 32 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY As indicated in the following table, at December 31, 2011, 3M had $4.576 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $5.166 billion of debt. Debt included $4.484 billion of long term debt, $563 million related to the current portion of long term debt and short term borrowings of $119 million. The strength of 3Ms capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3M reliable access to capital markets. Additionally, the Companys maturity profile is staggered to ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. The Company has an AA credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poors and an Aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moodys Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to pay dividends on 3M common stock, for acquisitions, and to fund share repurchase activities. As discussed in Note 2, in 2011 3M acquired Winterthur Technologie AG and other acquisitions for approximately $700 million (including purchases of noncontrolling interest). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company purchased Arizant Inc., Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. As a result, cash outflows (including repayment of acquired debt, but net of cash and marketable securities acquired) for these three acquisitions totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 3M was able to complete these acquisitions without increasing debt balances, while maintaining a strong cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position. At December 31 (Millions) 2011 2010 Total Debt $ 5,166 $ 5,452 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 4,576 5,018 Net Debt $ 590 $ 434 The Company defines net debt as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations. This measure is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately $4.6 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of $5.3 billion. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash and current marketable securities internationally totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and in the United States totaled $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. Cash available in the United States has historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, in addition to funding U.S. acquisitions, U.S. capital spending, U.S. pension/other postemployment benefit contributions, and other items as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no intention to repatriate these funds. If these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, for the international funds considered to be reinvested indefinitely, 3Ms current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. Refer to Note 8 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. The Companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $6.799 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $6.126 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $673 million. Working capital increases were primarily attributable to a decrease in the current portion of long term debt ($622 million), as increases in short term marketable securities, accounts receivables, inventories and other current assets were largely offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Primary short term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand, U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. The Company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3M to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, 3M 33 Table of Contents had no outstanding commercial paper. The Company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. In August 2011, 3M entered into a $1.5 billion, five year multi currency revolving credit agreement, which replaced the existing agreement that was due to expire in April 2012. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $500 million, bringing the total facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2011. Also, in August 2011, 3M entered into a $200 million, one year committed line/letter of credit agreement with HSBC Bank USA. This agreement replaced the sublimit for letters of credit that was previously encompassed in the $1.5 billion five year facility. As of December 31, 2011, available committed credit facilities, including the preceding $1.5 billion five year credit facility and $200 million facility, totaled approximately $1.785 billion worldwide. The amount utilized against these credit facilities totaled $147 million as of December 31, 2011. This included $121 million in letters of credit issued under the $200 million facility, $18 million in international lines of credit and $8 million in U.S. lines of credit outstanding with other banking partners. An additional approximately $100 million in stand alone letters of credit was also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2011. These lines/letters of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities. Under both the $1.5 billion and $200 million credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2011, this ratio was approximately 40 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. The Company has a well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective August 5, 2011, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. This replaced 3Ms previous shelf registration dated February 17, 2009. In September 2011, in connection with the August 5, 2011 well known seasoned issuer registration statement, 3M established a $3 billion medium term notes program (Series F), from which 3M issued a five year $1 billion fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 1.375%. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment in November 2011 of $800 million (principal amount) of medium term notes. In connection with a prior well known seasoned issuer shelf registration, in June 2007 the Company established a $3 billion medium term notes program. Three debt securities have been issued under this medium term notes program. First, in December 2007, 3M issued a five year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65%. Second, in August 2008, 3M issued a five year, $850 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375%. Third, in October 2008, the Company issued a three year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.50%. The Company entered into interest rate swaps to convert this $800 million note to a floating rate. This three year fixed rate note and related interest rate swaps matured in the fourth quarter of 2011. 3Ms cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2011 totaled $2.219 billion, with an additional $2.357 billion in current and long term marketable securities. 3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.555 billion in 2011, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2012, 3Ms Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 7.3 percent to 59 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.36 per share. In February 2011, 3Ms Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, replacing the Companys existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre established end date. In 2012, the Company plans to contribute an amount in the range of $800 million to $1 billion of cash to its U.S. and international pension and postretirement plans, with approximately $300 million in each of the first and second quarters. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2012. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. qualified plans funded status as of the 2012 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. This 34 Table of Contents combined index (defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.0 at December 31, 2011, a decline from 5.3 at December 31, 2010. Receivables increased $252 million, or 7.0 percent, compared with December 31, 2010, with higher December 2011 sales compared to December 2010 sales contributing to this increase. In addition, acquisitions increased accounts receivable by $106 million and currency translation decreased accounts receivable by $59 million. Inventories increased $261 million, or 8.3 percent, compared with December 31, 2010. The inventory increases are partially attributable to the increase in demand in 2011. In addition, acquisitions increased inventories by $128 million year on year, while currency translation decreased inventories by $18 million. Accounts payable decreased $19 million compared with December 31, 2010. Acquisitions increased the accounts payable balance by $68 million, while currency translation decreased accounts payable by $5 million. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. The Company revised the amounts previously presented for cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities during 2010 by $63 million. This revision related to purchases of additional shares (noncontrolling interest) of non wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. These immaterial revisions increased cash used in financing activities and decreased cash used in investing activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net income including noncontrolling interest $ 4,357 $ 4,163 $ 3,244 Depreciation and amortization 1,236 1,120 1,157 Company pension contributions (517 ) (556 ) (659 ) Company postretirement contributions (65 ) (62 ) (133 ) Company pension expense 449 271 176 Company postretirement expense 106 51 47 Stock based compensation expense 253 274 217 Income taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) 132 85 554 Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (53 ) (53 ) (14 ) Accounts receivable (205 ) (189 ) 55 Inventories (196 ) (404 ) 453 Accounts payable (83 ) 146 109 Product and other insurance receivables and claims 9 49 64 Other net (139 ) 279 (329 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,284 $ 5,174 $ 4,941 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in shares of the Companys common stock, which is considered a non cash financing activity. This non cash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows. In 2011, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $110 million compared to 2010. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year on year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. Two primary items reduced operating cash flows. First, 3M invested in working capital (which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable) in support of its growth. Working capital increased $484 million in 2011, with higher December 2011 sales compared to December 2010 sales contributing to this increase. This compared to working capital increases of $447 million in 2010. Second, Other net decreased cash flows by $139 million in 2011 compared to an increase of $279 million in 2010. The category, Other net, in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, such as a decrease in accrued payroll amounts in 2011 related to certain annual incentives, which reduced liabilities. In 2010, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $233 million compared to 2009. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year on year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. 35 Table of Contents Operating cash flows were reduced by working capital increases of $447 million in 2010, compared to working capital decreases of $617 million in 2009. 3M defines working capital as accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. These working capital increases were partially attributable to the rapid increase in demand in 2010. In addition, operating cash flows in 2009 benefited from changes in deferred and accrued income taxes. Free Cash Flow (non GAAP measure): In addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. Below find a recap of free cash flow for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,284 $ 5,174 $ 4,941 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) (1,379 ) (1,091 ) (903 ) Free Cash Flow $ 3,905 $ 4,083 $ 4,038 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $ (1,379 ) $ (1,091 ) $ (903 ) Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets 55 25 74 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (649 ) (1,830 ) (69 ) Purchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments net (745 ) 273 (839 ) Other investing activities (3 ) 5 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,718 ) $ (2,626 ) $ (1,732 ) Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending increased to $1.379 billion in 2011, compared to $1.091 billion in 2010 and $903 million in 2009. The Company expects 2012 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 to $1.5 billion as 3M continues to invest in capacity for future growth. In 2011, a large portion of this investment is addressing supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. In addition, some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. In 2010, in the U.S., 3M invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non optical businesses which use similar technology. Also, in 2010, 3M increased capacity at its multi purpose manufacturing facility in Singapore and invested in optical film capacity in Korea. Lastly, in 2010, investments in the Industrial and Transportation business included solar energy in the U.S. and industrial adhesives and tapes in China. In 2009, in response to then difficult global economic conditions, the Company reduced its capital spending significantly. Refer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available for sale. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset backed securities. The coupon interest rates for asset backed securities are either fixed rate or floating. Floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly LIBOR rate. Each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective LIBOR rate +/ an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. Terms of the reset are unique to individual securities. Fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond. The spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk 36 Table of Contents of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3Ms diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $2.357 billion as of December 31, 2011. Additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Years ended December 31 (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Change in short term debt net $ 11 $ (24 ) $ (536 ) Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (1,429 ) (556 ) (519 ) Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 1,111 108 41 Total cash change in debt $ (307 ) $ (472 ) $ (1,014 ) Purchases of treasury stock (2,701 ) (854 ) (17 ) Reissuances of treasury stock 902 666 431 Dividends paid to shareholders (1,555 ) (1,500 ) (1,431 ) Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 53 53 14 Other net (67 ) (77 ) 3 Net cash used in financing activities $ (3,675 ) $ (2,184 ) $ (2,014 ) Total debt at December 31, 2011 was $5.2 billion, compared to $5.5 billion at year end 2010 and $5.7 billion at year end 2009. Total debt was 25 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at both year end 2011 and year end 2010, compared with 30 percent at year end 2009. The net change in short term debt is typically due to commercial paper activity and international borrowings. In 2011, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included redemption of $800 million (principal amount) of medium term notes in November 2011, redemption of Convertible Notes, repayment of debt related to the 11.6 billion Japanese Yen note (installments paid in March and September 2011), repayment of the remainder of the Canadian Dollar loan, and repayment of a portion of debt that was acquired, primarily related to the Winterthur acquisition. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on these debt repayments. In 2010, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included repayment of $350 million in Dealer Remarketable Securities, which matured in December 2010, and repayment of a portion of debt related to the 5.8 billion Japanese Yen installment paid on September 30, 2010 (refer to Notes 6 and 10 for more detail). In addition, approximately $105 million in acquired debt related to 2010 acquisitions was subsequently repaid. In 2009, repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) includes a $400 million medium term note that matured in November 2009 and also includes repayments of commercial paper. In 2011, proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) primarily related to the issuance of a $1 billion medium term note and an amendment to a Canada loan agreement which increased the principal amount of the loan by 100.5 million Canadian Dollars. In 2010, proceeds from debt primarily include a 100.5 million Canadian Dollar loan. Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2011, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, replacing the Companys existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre established end date. In 2011, the Company purchased $2.701 billion in shares and in 2010 the Company purchased $854 million in shares, while in 2009 purchases were minimal as the Company had no broker purchases of treasury stock. For more information, refer to the table titled Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock. Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $1.555 billion ($2.20 per share) in 2011, $1.500 billion ($2.10 per share) in 2010 and $1.431 billion ($2.04 per share) in 2009. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2012, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 7.3 percent to 59 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.36 per share. This marked the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition to the items described below, other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. In 2011, as discussed in Note 6, subsequent to acquiring a controlling interest in Winterthur, 3M purchased additional outstanding shares of its Winterthur subsidiary for $57 million, increasing 3Ms ownership interest from approximately 86 percent to 100 percent as of December 31, 2011. These additional purchases are reflected as other financing activities in the statement of cash flows. In addition, during 2011, 3M sold a noncontrolling interest in a newly formed 37 Table of Contents subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. During the quarter ended March 31, 2010, as discussed in Notes 6 and 10, the Companys majority owned Sumitomo 3M Limited entity (Sumitomo 3M) purchased a portion of its shares held by its noncontrolling interest, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI), by paying cash of 5.8 billion Japanese Yen and entering into a note payable to SEI of 17.4 billion Japanese Yen (approximately $63 million and $188 million, respectively, based on applicable exchange rates at that time). The cash paid of approximately $63 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 as a result of the purchase of Sumitomo 3M shares from SEI is classified as Other financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The remainder of the purchase financed by the note payable to SEI is considered non cash financing activity in the first quarter of 2010. As discussed in Note 2, during the second quarter of 2010, 3M recorded a financed liability of 1.7 billion Japanese yen (approximately $18 million based on applicable exchange rates at that time) related to the A One acquisition, which is also considered a non cash financing activity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: As of December 31, 2011, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled Warranties/Guarantees in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property. While 3Ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, follows: Contractual Obligations Payments due by year After (Millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2016 Long term debt, including current portion (Note 10) $ 5,047 $ 563 $ 927 $ 1,463 $ 2 $ 995 $ 1,097 Interest on long term debt 2,011 182 159 396 78 78 1,118 Operating leases (Note 14) 502 155 113 87 55 40 52 Capital leases (Note 14) 100 19 20 18 5 4 34 Unconditional purchase obligations and other 1,235 781 236 139 36 13 30 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,895 $ 1,700 $ 1,455 $ 2,103 $ 176 $ 1,130 $ 2,331 Long term debt payments due in 2012 include $59 million of floating rate notes. The floating rate notes are classified as current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. As a result of put provisions, long term debt payments due in 2013 include floating rate notes totaling $73 million, and in 2014 include floating rate notes totaling $97 million. Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending in 2012 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis. 38 Table of Contents Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled Unconditional purchase obligations and other, include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long term portion of the net tax liability of $230 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 8 for further details. As discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2012 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the Companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2011. The model (third party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12 month time horizon. The model used analyzed 18 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. Foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2011, primarily due to increases in exposures, which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model. Interest rate volatility decreased in 2011 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low, based on forward rates. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures. Adverse impact on Positive impact on after tax earnings after tax earnings (Millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Foreign exchange rates $ (131 ) $ (108 ) $ 146 $ 120 Interest rates (2 ) (4 ) 2 4 Commodity rates (10 ) (15 ) 7 12 The global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $71 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately $43 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In the context of Item 7A, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in Item 7 concerning Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Financial Instruments, and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Long Term Debt and Short Term Borrowings, Derivatives, Fair Value Measurements, and the Derivatives and Hedging Activities accounting policy). All derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value at risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. The Company does not have leveraged derivative positions. 40 Table of Contents
