ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General During 2001, the Company continued to expand its existing product lines and further develop its markets. In particular, the Company continues to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "functional" beverage category with particular emphasis on Energy type drinks. The Company achieved record sales in 2001. The increase in sales in 2001 was primarily attributable to the growth in sales of the Companys Natural Sodas, Blue Sky Natural Sodas and apple juice, as well as sales of Junior Juice drinks since the acquisition by the Company of that brand and Energade(R) and E2O Energy Water since their respective introductions during the year. The increase in sales was partially offset by decreased sales of Smoothies in P.E.T. and glass bottles, and the Healthy Start/Silver Foxes juice line as well as lower sales of iced teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Signature Sodas and the childrens multi vitamin juice drinks in 8.45 ounce aseptic packaging. As a result of the change in the Companys product and customer mix, the gross profit percentage achieved by the Company in 2001 decreased to 44.2% from 46.5% in 2000. During 2001, sales outside of California represented 39% of the aggregate sales of the Company, as compared to approximately 37% of the aggregate sales of the Company in 2000. Sales to distributors outside the United States during 2001 amounted to $1,233,000 compared to $753,000 in 2000. The Company introduced a line of diet Natural Sodas in 12 ounce cans at the end of 2000/beginning of 2001 and an additional flavor, Ginger Ale, to its regular Natural Soda line in 2001. In addition, the Company also introduced its original Energy drink in 8.3 ounce glass bottles, two additional energy drinks in 8.3 ounce slim cans, Sparkling Lemonades and Orangeades in 1 liter glass bottles, Medicine Man(R) in glass bottles, Energade(R) in 23.5 ounce cans, E2O Energy Water in 24 ounce P.E.T. bottles, Soy Smoothies in 1 liter and 11 ounce aseptic packaging, additional juice blends in 64 ounce P.E.T. bottles, fruit juice Smoothies in 16 ounce P.E.T. bottles, functional nutrition bars and active nutrition bars. The Company reduced its Smoothie line in 64 ounce P.E.T. bottles from six flavors to two flavors. The Company is discontinuing its entire Healthy Start/Silver Foxes 100% juice lines in glass and P.E.T. bottles. Response from customers and consumers to the Medicine Man(R) line was disappointing and, in consequence, the Company is presently reevaluating that line. 19 Sales of the Companys dual branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(R)", which was launched in conjunction with Costco under the "Kirkland Signature(TM)/Hansens(R) Natural" brand name and is sold nationally through Costco stores, were slightly lower than in 2000. The Company has, in conjunction with Costco, introduced new flavors in place of certain of the existing flavors and will continue to introduce new flavors in an effort to ensure that its variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers. On September 20, 2000 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the Blue Sky Natural Soda business. The Blue Sky Natural Soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. Blue Sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and anti oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzers in 12 ounce cans. On May 25, 2001 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice, acquired the Junior Juice beverage business. The Junior Juice product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23 ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. During 2001, the Company entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of its products, both within and outside the United States. As discussed under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS MANUFACTURE, PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION", it is anticipated that the Company will continue building its national sales force in 2002 to support and grow the sales of its products. Further, during 2001, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, HEB, continued to market a malt based beverage called Hard e, which contains up to 5% alcohol. The Hard e product is not marketed under the Hansens name. The Company continues to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net sales were $92.3 million, an increase of $12.6 million or 15.7% over the $79.7 million net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of natural sodas, Blue Sky Natural Sodas, which trademark was acquired in September 2000, and apple juice and sales of Junior Juice, which trademark was acquired in May 2001 and Energade(R), which was introduced in July 2001. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was also attributable to the introduction of E2O Energy Water in June 2001, increased sales of Hard e, which was introduced in August 2000, natural bars, which were introduced in August 2000, smoothies in 11.5 ounce cans and juice blends. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreases in sales of smoothies in glass and P.E.T. bottles, Signature Sodas, childrens multi vitamin juice drinks, Healthy Start/Silver Foxes in glass and P.E.T. bottles and teas, lemonade and juice cocktails. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $3.7 million or 10.0% over the $37.1 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 44.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net sales. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to slightly lower margins achieved as a result of a change in the Companys product and customer mix. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $5.1 million or 16.9% over total operating expenses of $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. 20 Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 38.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively larger increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 an increase of $5.0 million or 16.5% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling expenses were $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $3.6 million or 17.1% over selling expenses of $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased promotional expenditures, distribution (freight) expenses, commissions, expenditures for graphic design and premiums as well as fees paid for slotting. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenditures for advertising, merchandise displays, point of sale and in store demonstrations. General and administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.4 million or 15% over general and administrative expenses of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to an increase in payroll costs, which was partially offset by a decrease in other general and administrative costs. The increase in payroll costs was partially attributable to noncash compensation expense related to the exercise of stock options of $231,000. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $136,000 over amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $371,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was primarily attributable to the amortization of the Blue Sky trademark for a full year since the trademark was acquired in September 2000. To a lesser extent, the increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of the Junior Juice trademark in May 2001. Operating Income. Operating income was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The $1.3 million decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses, which was partially offset by increased gross profit. Net Non operating Expense. Net non operating expense was $519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, which was $150,000 higher than net non operating expense of $369,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Net non operating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $528,000, as compared to $382,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to the increase in long term debt, primarily related to the acquisition of the Blue Sky business in 2000. See also "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $9,000, as compared to interest income of $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a reduction in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2001. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $2.0 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2001 was 40.0% as compared to 40.1% for 2000. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to decreased operating income. 21 Net Income. Net income was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The $896,000 decrease in net income was attributable to decreased operating income of $1.3 million and increased non operating expense of $150,000, which was partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes of $603,000. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1999 Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2000, net sales were $79.7 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 10.3% over the $72.3 million net sales for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of the Companys energy and other functional drinks in 8.2 ounce slim cans and increased sales of the Companys new childrens multi vitamin juice drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was also attributable to increased sales of apple juice and Natural Sodas and sales of Healthy Start in glass bottles as well as Blue Sky Natural Sodas since the acquisition by the Company of that brand in September 2000. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreases in sales of the Silver Foxes juice line, Smoothies in cans, glass and P.E.T. bottles, Signature Sodas and iced teas, lemonades and juice cocktails. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $3.6 million or 10.6% over the $33.5 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased marginally to 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 46.4% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net sales. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to slightly higher margins achieved as a result of a change in the Companys product mix. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $4.2 million or 16.0% over total operating expenses of $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2000, from 36.0% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses and was partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses. The increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively larger increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 an increase of $4.5 million or 17.7% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.

The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased promotional expenditures, distribution (freight) expenses, expenditures for merchandise displays and point of sale materials, as well as fees paid for slotting. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenditures for in store demonstrations. General and administrative expenses were $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $1.5 million or 19.9% over general and administrative expenses of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll costs and certain other expenses incurred in connection with product development and expansion activities into additional states. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $371,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $63,000 over amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $308,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was primarily 22 attributable to the acquisition of the Blue Sky trademark, which was acquired during 2000 and is being amortized over a period of 40 years. No other operating expenses were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared with $380,000 in other operating expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 1999. Other operating expenses incurred in 1999 were primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with a proposed business combination that was not completed. Operating Income. Operating income was $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The $601,000 decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses, which was partially offset by increased gross profit. Net Non operating Expense. Net non operating expense was $369,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, which was $317,000 higher than net non operating expense of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. Net non operating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $382,000, as compared to $171,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to the increase in long term debt, primarily related to the acquisition of the Blue Sky business. See also "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $13,000, as compared to interest income of $118,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a reduction in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2000. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2.6 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2000 was 40.1% as compared to 39.9% for 1999. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to decreased operating income. Net Income. Net income was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The $563,000 decrease in net income was attributable to decreased operating income of $601,000 and increased non operating expense of $317,000, which was partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes of $355,000. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2001, the Company had working capital of $12,978,000 compared to working capital of $13,644,000 as of December 31, 2000. The decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to payments made on long term debt and increased expenditures for the acquisition of property, trademark license and trademarks, and deposits and other assets. The decrease was offset by working capital provided by net income earned after adjustments for certain non cash expenses, primarily amortization of trademark license and trademarks, depreciation and other amortization, the increase in deferred income taxes and compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options. The Companys cash was used for certain working capital items, such as acquisition of increased inventories and to reduce accounts payable, as well as the acquisition of the Blue Sky and Junior Juice businesses, trademark licenses and trademarks, purchases of property and equipment. The acquisition of increased inventories, increases in accounts receivable, increases in deposits and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademark licenses and trademarks, and repayment of the Companys line of credit are expected to remain the Companys principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $682,000, as compared to net cash used in investment activities of $7.9 million in 2000. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was 23 primarily attributable to lower levels of trademark acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and deposits and other assets in 2001. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the Hansens(R) brand, as well as the introduction of new product lines. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2001, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $7.1 million in 2000. The increase in net cash used in financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increased principal payments of long term debt, the reduction of short term borrowings and decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2001. During 2000, the Company purchased common stock to be held in treasury, whereas no such purchases occurred in 2001. In 1997, HBC obtained a credit facility from Comerica Bank California ("Comerica"), consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $3.0 million in aggregate at any time outstanding and a term loan of $4.0 million. The utilization of the revolving line of credit by HBC was dependent upon certain levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventory from time to time. Such revolving line of credit and term loans were secured by substantially all of HBCs assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, trademark licenses and certain equipment. That facility was subsequently modified from time to time, and on September 19, 2000, HBC entered into modification agreement with Comerica which amended certain provisions under the above facility in order to finance the acquisition of the Blue Sky business, repay the term loan, and provide additional working capital ("Modification Agreement"). Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, the revolving line of credit was increased to $12.0 million, reducing to $6.0 million by September 2004. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through September 2005. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on banks base (prime) rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of HBC from time to time. The following represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2001: Long Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligations Operating Lease Total Year ending December 31: 2002 $ 337,872 $ 623,729 $ 961,601 2003 235,241 644,918 880,159 2004 250,463 647,726 898,189 2005 5,218,641 645,266 5,863,907 2006 146,760 660,468 807,228 Thereafter 2,539,485 2,539,485 $ 6,188,977 $ 5,761,592 $ 11,950,569 The terms of the Companys line of credit contain certain financial covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements. The line of credit contains provisions under which applicable interest rates will be adjusted in increments based on the achievement of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2001. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comercia may declare any or all of portions outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code, institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon the lien and security interest granted or for the sale of any or all collateral. Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for its working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of 24 shares of common stock of the Company, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment through December 31, 2002. European Monetary Union Within Europe, the European Economic and Monetary Union (the "EMU") introduced a new currency, the Euro, on January 1, 1999. The new currency is in response to the EMUs policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy, eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital, goods and services. On January 1, 2000, the participating countries adopted the Euro as their local currency, initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash transactions such as banking. The existing local currencies, or legacy currencies, will remain legal tender through January 1, 2002. Beginning January 1, 2002, Euro denominated bills and coins will be used for cash transactions. For a period of up to six months from this date, both legacy currencies and the Euro will be legal tender. On or before July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currencies and exclusively use the Euro. The Companys transactions are recorded in U.S. Dollars and the Company does not currently anticipate future transactions being recorded in the Euro. Based on the lack of transactions recorded in the Euro, the Company does not believe that the Euro will have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. In addition, the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur any significant costs from the continued implementation of the Euro, including any currency risk, which could materially affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company has not experienced any significant operational disruptions to date and does not currently expect the continued implementation of the Euro to cause any significant operational disruptions. Critical Accounting Policies The following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company. Trademark License and Trademarks Trademark license represents the Companys exclusive world wide right to use the Hansens(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of carbonated beverages and waters, shelf stable fruit juices and drinks containing fruit juices on a royalty free basis and other non carbonated beverages and water and non beverage products in consideration of royalty payments. In September 1999, HBC entered into an Assignment and Agreement with the Fresh Juice Company of California, Inc. ("FJC"), pursuant to which HBC acquired exclusive ownership of the Hansens(R) trademark and trade names and its obligation to pay royalties on certain product lines fell away. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R) trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R) trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. The Company amortizes its trademark license and trademarks over 40 years. The Companys adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, will affect the Companys method of amortizing its trademark license and trademarks. Long Lived Assets The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. In accordance with SFAS No. 121, long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred. As of December 31, 2001, management does not believe that the Companys long lived assets have been 25 impaired. If the carrying value of the long lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value. Advertising and Promotional Allowances The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports its customers with promotional allowances, portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. In certain instances, a portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the Company. If the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent it is based on estimates, be affected. The adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01 9, as described below, will affect the presentation of these advertising expenses and promotional allowances within the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. New Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that the Company recognize all derivative instruments as either current or non current assets or liabilities at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. During 2000 and 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards ("FASB") EITF addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a reseller or another party that purchases the vendors products. EITF No. 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendors Products, was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier pronouncements. The consensus requires certain sales promotions and customer allowances currently classified as selling, general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of net sales. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of EITF No. 01 9 on its financial statements and will comply with its provisions beginning in the first quarter of 2002. In June 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 prospectively prohibits the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life and the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. SFAS No. 142 will apply to goodwill and intangible assets arising from transactions completed before and after the effective date of June 30, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 is required for the Company on January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 142 is expected to reduce the trademark amortization expense currently recognized by the Company. In December 1999, the Securities Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 101 summarizes certain of the staffs views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to revenue recognition and accounting for deferred costs in the consolidated financial statements and is effective no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. Based on the Companys revenue recognition policy, there was no material impact to the Companys financial position and consolidated statements of income from the adoption of SAB No. 101. 26 In accordance with EITF No. 00 10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, reimbursements of freight charges are recorded in net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, freight out costs amounted to $4.2 million, $4.1 million, and $3.8 million, respectively, and have been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position and will adopt such standards on January 1, 2003, as required. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which supersedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is required no later than the beginning of fiscal 2002. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a significant impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. However, future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of long lived assets. Year 2000 Compliance Prior to January 1, 2000, the Company reviewed the readiness of its computer systems and business practices for handling Year 2000 issues. Since entering the Year 2000, the Company has not experienced any major disruptions to its business nor is it aware of any significant Year 2000 related disruptions impacting its customers and suppliers. Cost incurred to achieve Year 2000 readiness, which include any contractor costs to modify existing systems and costs of internal resources dedicated to achieving Year 2000 compliance, were changed to expense as incurred and were not material in 2000. Forward Looking Statements The Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to shareholders and announcements. Certain statements made in this report, including certain statements made in managements discussion and analysis, may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933 as amended and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and the Companys existing credit facility, among other things. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and or the Companys existing credit facility, earnings per share growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and or important factors, many of which are outside the control of the Company that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following: 27 o Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities; o Changes in consumer preferences; o Changes in demand that are weather related, particular in areas outside of California; o Competitive products and pricing pressures and the Companys ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors; o The introduction of new products; o Laws and regulations, and or any changes therein, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws as well as the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, and regulations made thereunder or in connection therewith, especially those that may affect the way in which the Companys products are marketed as well as laws and regulations or rules made or enforced by the Food and Drug Administration and or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and or certain state regulatory agencies; o Changes in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely and or adequate production of all or any of the Companys products; o The Companys ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others and in respect of many which the Companys experience is limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales; o The Companys ability to penetrate new markets; o The marketing efforts of distributors of the Companys products, most of which distribute products that are competitive with the products of the Company; o Unilateral decisions by distributors, grocery store chains, specialty chain stores, club stores, mass merchandisers and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the Companys products that they are carrying at any time; o The terms and or availability of the Companys credit facility and the actions of its creditors; o The effectiveness of the Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs; o Adverse weather conditions, which could reduce demand for the Companys products; o The Companys ability to make suitable arrangements for the co packing of its Energy and functional drinks in 8.3 ounce slim cans, Smoothies in 11.5 ounce cans, E20 Energy Water, Energade and other products. The foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (twenty four 8 ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. A case of food bars and cereals is defined as follows: A fruit and grain bar and functional nutrition bar case equals ninety 1.76 ounce bars. A natural cereal case equals ten 13 ounce boxes measured by volume. An active nutrition bar case equals thirty two 1.4 ounce bars. The Companys quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been Hansens experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansens products is California, which has a year long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been 28 mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansens products expands outside of California. The Company has not had sufficient experience with its food bars, cereal products and Hard e malt based products and consequently has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with such products. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products, soda concentrates and food products and increased advertising and promotional expenses.

ITEM 7a. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is exposed to are fluctuations in commodity prices, affecting the cost of raw materials, and changes in interest rates on the Companys long term debt. The Company is subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because its ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which it operates. At December 31, 2001, the majority of the Companys debt consisted of variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys cash requirements. If average interest rates were to increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2001, the net impact on the Companys pre tax earnings would have been approximately $71,000.
