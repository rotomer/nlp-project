ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on managements current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements. General During 2002, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continue to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. We achieved record sales in 2002. The increase in gross and net sales in 2002 was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster (TM) energy drink, which was introduced in April 2002, as well as increased sales of Natural Sodas, E2O Energy WaterTM, which was introduced in June 2001, Energade(R) energy sports drinks which were introduced in July 2001, apple juice, and Soy Smoothies, which were introduced in December 2001. We also benefited to a lesser extent from increased sales of the childrens multi vitamin juice drinks and Junior Juice(R), which trademark was acquired in May 2001. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of Signature Soda, Smoothies, Hard e, functional drinks and teas, lemonades and cocktails. During 2002, sales outside of California represented 42% of our aggregate sales, as compared to approximately 39% of our aggregate sales in 2001. Sales to distributors outside the United States during 2002 amounted to $1,242,000 compared to $1,233,000 in 2001. 18 In 2002, we introduced a diet ginger ale, natural mixers, Monster(TM) energy, E2O Energy Water in 24 ounce clear P.E.T. plastic bottles, a 100% sparkling Apple Cider, a Diet Red energy drink, a Blue Sky(R) energy drink and diet sparkling Lemonades and Orangeades. We also introduced a line of diet Natural Sodas in 12 ounce cans at the end of 2000/beginning of 2001 and an additional flavor, Ginger Ale, to our regular natural soda line in 2001. In addition, in 2001, we also introduced our original energy drink in 8.3 ounce glass bottles, two additional energy drinks in 8.3 ounce slim cans, sparkling lemonades and orangeades in 1 liter glass bottles, Medicine Man(R) in glass bottles, Energade(R) in 23.5 ounce cans, E2O Energy Water in 24 ounce blue P.E.T. plastic bottles, Soy Smoothies in 1 liter and 11 ounce aseptic packaging, additional juice blends in 64 ounce P.E.T. bottles, fruit juice Smoothies in 16 ounce P.E.T. bottles, functional nutrition bars and active nutrition bars. In 2002, we discontinued our smoothie line in 64 ounce P.E.T. bottles and converted our smoothie products in 12 ounce glass bottles to 16 ounce P.E.T. plastic bottles. We also discontinued our entire Healthy Start/Silver Foxes 100% juice line in glass and P.E.T. plastic bottles and the Medicine Man(R) line. At the beginning of 2003, we repackaged our Signature Soda line into new lower cost glass packaging. Sales of our dual branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(R)", which was launched in conjunction with Costco and is sold nationally through Costco stores, were slightly higher in 2002 than in 2001. We have, in conjunction with Costco, introduced new flavors in place of certain of the existing flavors and will continue to introduce new flavors in an effort to ensure that the variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers. In September 2000, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the Blue Sky(R) Natural Soda business. The Blue Sky(R) Natural Soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. Blue Sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and anti oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12 ounce cans. In May 2001, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice, acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business. The Junior Juice(R) product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23 ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. During 2002, we entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of our products, both within and outside the United States. As discussed under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS MANUFACTURE and DISTRIBUTION", we anticipate that we will continue building our national sales force in 2003 to support and grow the sales of our products. Further, during 2002, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, HEB, continued to market a malt based beverage called Hard e, which contains up to 5% alcohol. The Hard e product is not marketed under the Hansens(R) name. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross sales were $115.5 million, an increase of $15.8 million or 15.8% higher than gross sales of $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to the introduction of new products and increased sales of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales". Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net sales were $92.0 million, an increase of $11.3 million or 14.1% higher than net sales of $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster (TM) energy drink, which was introduced in April 2002, as well as increased sales of Natural Sodas, E2O Energy Water, which was introduced in June 2001, Energade(R) energy sports 19 drinks, which were introduced in July 2001, apple juice, and Soy Smoothies, which were introduced in December 2001. We also benefited to a lesser extent from increased sales of the childrens multi vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice(R), which was acquired in May 2001, and smoothies in P.E.T. plastic bottles. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of Signature Soda, Hard e, functional drinks, teas, lemonades and cocktails and smoothies in cans as well as an increase in discounts, allowances and promotional payments, notably higher coupon costs. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $4.3 million or 15.2% over the $28.9 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002 which was slightly higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net sales. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products notably higher coupon costs. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $4.7 million or 19.9% over total operating expenses of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.4 % for the year ended December 31, 2002, from 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively larger increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $5.1 million or 22.3% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling expenses were $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $3.7 million or 29.9% over selling expenses of $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses, advertising, point of sale materials and merchandise displays, in store demonstrations and graphic design. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenditures for premiums. General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.4 million or 13.3% over general and administrative expenses of $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002 which was comparable to the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll costs, charitable contributions, fees paid for legal and accounting services and increased travel expenses as well as other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively lower increase in payroll costs. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $452,000 from amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002 (Note 2 of the financial statements) which eliminated amortization on indefinite lived intangible assets. 20 Operating Income. Operating income was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The $258,000 decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses, which was partially offset by increased gross profit. Net Non operating Expense. Net non operating expense was $228,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, which was $291,000 lower than net non operating expense of $519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net non operating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $231,000, as compared to $528,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to decreased interest expense incurred on our borrowings which was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3,000, as compared to interest income of $9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a reduction in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2002. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $2.0 million which was comparable to the provision for income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2002 was 40.2%, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 40.0% for 2001. Net Income. Net income was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, which was comparable to net income for the year ended December 31, 2001. The $4.3 million increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating expense of $291,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 was offset by increased operating expenses of $4.7 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2001, gross sales were $99.7 million, an increase of $13.6 million or 15.8% higher than gross sales of $86.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to the introduction of new products and increased sales of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales". Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net sales were $80.7 million, an increase of $9.0 million or 12.5% higher than gross sales of $71.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of natural sodas, Blue Sky(R) soda, which was acquired in September 2000, apple juice and sales of Junior Juice, which was acquired in May 2001. The increase in sales was attributable to a lesser extent to sales of Energade(R), which was introduced in July 2001 and E2O Energy Water, which was introduced in June 2001. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of smoothies in glass and P.E.T. bottles, Signature Sodas, childrens multi vitamin juice drinks, and teas, lemonade and juice cocktails as well as increased discounts, allowances and promotional payments. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $64,000 or 0.2% from the $29.0 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 40.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to increases in discounts, allowances and promotional payments as well as increased cost of goods sold which was almost wholly offset by increased net sales. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to slightly lower margins achieved as a result of a change in our product and customer mix. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.3 million or 5.8% over total operating expenses of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Total 21 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, General and Administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.1 million or 5.3% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling expenses were $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $244,000 or 1.9% over selling expenses of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 17.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in selling expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenditures for advertising, merchandise displays, point of sale and in store demonstrations which was largely offset by an increase in distribution (freight) expenses, commissions, expenditures for graphic design and premiums as well as fees paid for slotting. General and administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.4 million or 15.4% over general and administrative expenses of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to an increase in payroll costs, which was partially offset by a decrease in other general and administrative costs. The increase in payroll costs was partially attributable to noncash compensation expense related to the exercise of stock options of $231,000. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $136,000 over amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $371,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was primarily attributable to the amortization of the Blue Sky trademark for a full year since the trademark was acquired in September 2000. To a lesser extent, the increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of the Junior Juice trademark in May 2001. Operating Income. Operating income was $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The $1.3 million decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses, which was partially offset by increased gross profit. Net Non operating Expense. Net non operating expense was $519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, which was $150,000 higher than net non operating expense of $369,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Net non operating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $528,000, as compared to $382,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to the increase in long term debt, primarily related to the acquisition of the Blue Sky business in 2000. See also "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $9,000, as compared to interest income of $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a reduction in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2001. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $2.0 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2001 was 40.0% as compared to 40.1% for 2000. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to decreased operating income. 22 Net Income. Net income was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The $896,000 decrease in net income was attributable to decreased operating income of $1.3 million and increased non operating expense of $150,000, which was partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes of $603,000. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2002, the Company had working capital of $14,950,000 compared to working capital of $12,978,000 as of December 31, 2001. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to net income earned after adjustments for certain non cash expenses, primarily amortization of trademark license and trademarks, depreciation and other amortization, a decrease in deposits and other assets and an increase in deferred income taxes which was partially offset by payments made in reduction of long term debt and increased expenditures for the acquisition of property, trademark license and trademarks. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $2,727,000, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5,203,000 during 2001. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable, which was partially offset by decreases in amortization of trademark license and trademarks, decreases in inventory, and an increase in accounts payable. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable, and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademark licenses and trademarks, and repayment of our line of credit and accounts payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $92,000 as compared to net cash used in investment activities of $682,000 in 2001. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower levels of purchases of property and equipment and trademark acquisitions, which was partially offset by increased expenditures for deposits and other assets in 2002. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, specific items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the Hansens(R) brand, as well as the introduction of new product lines. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2002, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $4.4 million in 2001. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to decreased principal payments of long term debt, which was marginally offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2002. In 1997, HBC obtained a credit facility from Comerica Bank California ("Comerica"), consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $3.0 million in aggregate at any time outstanding and a term loan of $4.0 million. The utilization of the revolving line of credit by HBC was dependent upon certain levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventory from time to time. Such revolving line of credit and term loan was secured by substantially all of HBCs assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, trademark licenses and certain equipment. That facility was subsequently modified from time to time, and on September 19, 2000, HBC entered into modification agreement with Comerica which amended certain provisions under the above facility in order to finance the acquisition of the Blue Sky business, repay the term loan, and provide additional working capital ("Modification Agreement"). Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, the revolving line of credit was increased to $12.0 million, reducing to $6.0 million by September 2004. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through September 2005. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on banks base (prime) rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of HBC from time to time. At December 31, 2002, $2,969,000 was outstanding under the credit facility and borrowing capacity available to the Company from Comerica under the credit facility was $6,331,000. 23 The following represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2002: Long Term Debt & Capital Lease Operating Obligations Lease Total Year ending December 31: 2003 $ 230,740 $ 653,727 $ 884,467 2004 264,234 656,536 920,770 2005 3,195,314 658,179 3,853,493 2006 146,492 680,708 827,200 2007 660,468 660,468 Thereafter 1,879,017 1,879,017 $ 3,836,780 $ 5,188,635 $ 9,025,415 The terms of the Companys line of credit contain certain financial covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements. The line of credit contains provisions under which applicable interest rates will be adjusted in increments based on the achievement of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants at December 31, 2002. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare any or all of portions outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code, institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon the lien and security interest granted or for the sale of any or all collateral. Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment through December 31, 2003. Critical Accounting Policies The following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company. Trademark License and Trademarks Trademark license and trademarks represent primarily the Companys ownership of the Hansens(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water and non beverage products. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R) trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R) trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite lived trademark licenses and trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademark licenses and trademarks over one to 25 years. Long Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from 24 the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with managements estimates of the business risks. Annually, or earlier, if there is indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on managements best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2002. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademark license and trademarks, is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Managements assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgement because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenues data for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Advertising and Promotional Allowances The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports its customers with promotional allowances, a portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. In certain instances, portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the Company. If the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent based on estimates, be affected. During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01 9 which requires certain sales promotions and customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales or as cost of goods sold. The Company has conformed its presentation of advertising and promotional allowances to comply with the provisions of EITF No. 01 9. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements During 2000 and 2001, the EITF addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a reseller or another party that purchases the vendors products. EITF No. 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendors Products, was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier pronouncements. The consensus requires certain sales promotions and customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of net sales or as cost of goods sold. The Company adopted EITF No. 01 9 on January 1, 2002. The effect of the change in accounting related to the adoption of EITF No. 01 9 for the year ended December 31, 2002 was to decrease net sales by $14,846,875, increase cost of goods sold by $220,394 and decrease selling, general and administrative expenses by $15,067,269. For the year ended December 31, 2001 net sales decreased by $11,621,396, cost of goods sold increased by $341,332 and selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $11,962,728. For the year ended December 31, 2000, $8,026,724 has been classified as a reduction of net sales and $133,390 as an increase in cost of goods sold, both of which were previously reported as selling, general and administrative expense respectively. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, subject to periodic impairment testing. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company 25 evaluated the useful lives of its various trademark licenses and trademarks and concluded that certain of the trademark licenses and trademarks have indefinite lives. Unamortized trademark licenses and trademarks ceased to be amortized effective January 1, 2002 and will be subject to periodic impairment analysis. Had the non amortization provision of SFAS No. 142 been adopted as of January 1, 2000, net income and net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 would have been adjusted as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net income, as reported $3,029,195 $3,019,353 $3,915,126 Add back: Amortization of trademark licenses and trademarks with indefinite lives (net of tax effect) 292,241 211,716 Adjusted net income $3,029,195 $3,311,594 $4,126,842 Net income per common share basic, as reported $ 0.30 $ 0.30 $ 0.39 Amortization of trademark licenses and trademarks with indefinite lives (net of tax effect) 0.03 0.02 Adjusted net income per common share basic $ 0.30 $ 0.33 $ 0. 41 Net income per common share diluted, as Reported $ 0.29 $ 0.29 $ 0.38 Amortization of trademark licenses and trademarks with indefinite lives (net of tax effect) 0.03 0.02 Adjusted net income per common share diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.32 $ 0.40 On January 1 and December 31, 2002, the nonamortizing trademark licenses and trademarks were tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Fair values were estimated based on the Companys best estimate of the expected present value of future cash flows. No amounts were impaired at that time. In addition, the remaining useful lives of trademark licenses and trademarks being amortized were reviewed and deemed to be appropriate. The FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2002. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The new rules on asset impairment supersede FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and provide a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of. The Company has performed an analysis and determined that the adoption of this Statement had no effect on the earnings or financial position of the Company. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. For most companies, Statement No. 145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under Statement No. 4. Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in APB Opinion No. 30. Statement No. 145 also amends Statement No. 13 to require certain modifications to capital leases be treated as a sale leaseback and modifies the accounting for sub leases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor (or guarantor). In addition, the FASB rescinded Statement No. 44, which addressed the accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and made numerous technical corrections. The Company has not yet determined the effect, if any, of the adoption of this Statement. 26 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes EITF No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.) SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF No. 94 3, a liability for an exit cost as defined in EITF No. 94 3 was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Statement No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS No. 123s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. The Company has adopted the new disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN No. 45"). FIN No. 45 clarifies and expands on existing disclosure requirements for guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also would require that, at the inception of a guarantee, the Company must recognize a liability for the fair value of its obligation under that guarantee. The initial fair value recognition and measurement provisions will be applied on a prospective basis to certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN No. 45 will have a material impact on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN No. 46"). FIN No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN No. 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN No. 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. Since the Company has no interests in variable interest entities, the Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN No. 46 will have a material impact on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Forward Looking Statements The Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to shareholders and announcements. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933 as amended and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act 27 of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and or the Companys existing credit facility, earnings per share growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are qualified by their terms and or important factors, many of which are outside our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following: o The Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities; o Changes in consumer preferences; o Changes in demand that are weather related, particular in areas outside of California; o Competitive products and pricing pressures and the Companys ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors; o The introduction of new products; o Laws and regulations, and or any changes therein, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws as well as the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, and regulations made thereunder or in connection therewith, especially those that may affect the way in which the Companys products are marketed as well as laws and regulations or rules made or enforced by the Food and Drug Administration and or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and or certain state regulatory agencies; o Changes in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely and or adequate production of all or any of the Companys products; o The Companys ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others and in respect of many which the Companys experience is limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales; o The Companys ability to penetrate new markets; o The marketing efforts of distributors of the Companys products, most of which distribute products that are competitive with the products of the Company; o Unilateral decisions by distributors, grocery store chains, specialty chain stores, club stores, mass merchandisers and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the Companys products that they are carrying at any time; o The terms and or availability of the Companys credit facility and the actions of its creditors; o The effectiveness of the Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs; o The Companys ability to make suitable arrangements for the co packing of its various products including, but not limited to, its energy and functional drinks in 8.3 ounce slim cans, smoothies in 11.5 ounce cans, E2O Energy Water, Energade, Monster energy drinks, soy smoothies, sparkling orangeades and lemonades in glass bottles and other products. The foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 28 Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. A case of food bars and cereals is defined as follows: o A fruit and grain bar and functional nutrition bar case equals ninety 1.76 ounce bars. o A natural cereal case equals ten 13 ounce boxes measured by volume. o An active nutrition bar case equals thirty two 1.4 ounce bars. The Companys quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansens products is California, which has a year long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansens products expands outside of California. The Company has not had sufficient experience with its food bars, cereal products and Hard e malt based products and consequently has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with such products. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products, soda concentrates and food products and increased advertising and promotional expenses.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is exposed to are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and changes in interest rates on the Companys long term debt. The Company is subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because its ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which it operates. At December 31, 2002, the majority of the Companys debt consisted of variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys cash requirements. If average interest rates were to increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2002, the net impact on the Companys pre tax earnings would have been approximately $40,000.
