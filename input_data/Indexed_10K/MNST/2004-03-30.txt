See "Forward Looking Statements" and "ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS" 19 Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute, in the main, a wide range of branded beverages. The majority of our beverages fall within the growing "alternative" beverage category. The principal brand names under which our beverages are marketed are Hansens(R), Monster Energy(TM), Blue Sky(R), Junior Juice(R), and Lost(R). We own all of our above listed brand names other than Lost(R) which we produce, market, sell and distribute under an exclusive licensing arrangement with Lost International LLC. Our company principally generates revenues, income and cash flows by developing, producing, marketing, selling and distributing finished beverage products. We generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors. We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including advertising costs, sponsorship fees and special promotional events. We focus on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. Retailers and distributors receive rebates, promotions, point of sale materials, merchandise displays and coolers. We also use in store promotions and in store placement of point of sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, and sponsorship of, and endorsements from, selected public and extreme sports figures and causes. Consumers receive coupons, discounts and promotional incentives. These marketing expenditures help to enhance distribution and availability of our products as well as awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. Greater distribution and availability, awareness and preference promotes long term growth. During 2003, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continue to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation; such as making Hansens(R) products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. We again achieved record sales in 2003. The increase in gross and net sales in 2003 was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster Energy(R) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo carb") Monster Energy(R) drink which was introduced in 2003, as well as increased sales of Natural Sodas, in particular Diet Natural Sodas, our Energy Deuce drink, Junior Juice, Diet Energy, apple juice and, to a lesser extent, sparkling beverages. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales primarily of energy drinks in 8.3 ounce cans, Smoothies, E2O Energy Water(R), Soy Smoothies, Energade(R) energy sports drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. During 2003, sales outside of California represented 47% of our aggregate sales, as compared to approximately 42% of our aggregate sales in 2002. Sales to distributors outside the United States during 2003 amounted to $1,612,000 compared to $1,242,000 in 2002. Our customers are typically retail and specialty chains, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors and health food distributors. In 2003, sales to retailers represented 47% of our revenues, sales to full service distributors represented 37% of our revenues and sales to health food distributors represented 10% of our revenues. 20 In 2003, we introduced a carbonated lo carb Monster Energy(R) drink in 16 ounce cans, a carbonated energy Deuce drink in 16 ounce cans, a diet root beer Natural Soda, a 100% Apple Juice in aseptic pouches, and regular and diet sparkling Lemonades and Orangeades in 12 ounce glass bottles. Sales of our dual branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(R)", which was launched in conjunction with Costco and is sold nationally through Costco stores, were lower in 2003 than in 2002. We have, in conjunction with Costco, introduced new flavors in place of certain of the existing flavors and will continue to introduce new flavors in an effort to ensure that the variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers. In September 2000, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the Blue Sky(R) Natural Soda business. The Blue Sky(R) Natural Soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. Blue Sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and anti oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12 ounce cans and a Blue Energy drink in 8.3 ounce cans. During the year, we continued to expand distribution of the Blue Sky products into mainstream grocery chain stores throughout the country. In May 2001, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice, acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business. The Junior Juice(R) product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23 ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. During 2003, we entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of our products, both within and outside the United States. As discussed under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS MANUFACTURE and DISTRIBUTION", we anticipate that we will continue building our national sales force in 2004 to support and grow the sales of our products. A chain grocery store strike in Southern California, which commenced during the last quarter of 2003, adversely affected sales of those of our products that are carried by the stores concerned. However, the drop in sales of such products was partially offset by increased sales of certain of those products that are carried by other retailers in Southern California. In 2002, we introduced a Sparkling Cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5 liter Magnum glass bottle. However, due to limited reports of some bottles breaking, we promptly recalled the product. We are pursuing a claim for the costs and losses incurred by us. We will reevaluate relaunching this product once certain production issues are resolved to our satisfaction. At the beginning of 2004, we launched a new carbonated energy drink under the Lost(R) brand name, in a 16 ounce can. The Lost(R) brand name is owned by Lost International LLC and the drinks are produced, sold and distributed by us under exclusive license from Lost International LLC. During 2004, we were awarded an exclusive contract by the State of California, Department of Health Services Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Nutrition Branch, to supply 100% Apple juice and 100% Apple Grape juice in 64 ounce PET plastic bottles. See "ITEM 1 BUSINESS MANUFACTURE and DISTRIBUTION." We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: o Profitable Growth We believe healthy brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. We believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. 21 o Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. However, due to the expansion in the number of our products as well as increased sales levels in 2003, overall inventory levels increased. o Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net operating revenues, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. In 2003, gross operating revenues totaled $138.5 million, a 19.9% increase from 2002. Net operating revenues totaled $110.4 million, an increase of 19.9% over 2002. Gross profit totaled $43.8 million in 2003, a 31.7% increase from 2002. Operating income was $9.8 million compared to $5.3 million for 2002. Net income was $5.9 million as compared to $3.0 million for 2002. Net income per share (diluted) was $0.55 from $0.29 per diluted share in 2002. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2004 and beyond. See also "Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002. In 2003, the Company had working capital of $17.2 million compared to $15 million as of December 31, 2002. In 2003, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $5.5 million, a 101% increase from 2002. Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademark licenses and trademarks. Repayment of our debt and accounts payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. See also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. 22 In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our companys future financial results include, but are not limited to: o maintenance of our brand images and product quality; o profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also "ITEM 1 BUSINESS COMPETITION" and "SALES AND MARKETING"); o restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; o protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademark licenses and trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; and o the imposition of additional restrictions. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: o growth potential for non alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; o new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; o premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; o significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; and o proper positioning to capture industry growth. 23 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 03 vs. 02 02 vs. 01 Gross sales $ 138,454,345 $ 115,490,019 $ 99,693,390 19.9% 15.8% Less: Discounts, allowances and promotional payments 28,102,149 23,443,657 19,035,073 19.9% 23.2% Net sales 110,352,196 92,046,362 80,658,317 19.9% 14.1% Cost of sales 66,577,168 58,802,669 51,796,539 13.2% 13.5% Gross profit 43,775,028 33,243,693 28,861,778 31.7% 15.2% Gross profit margin 39.7% 36.1% 35.8% Selling, general and 33,887,045 27,896,202 22,803,433 21.5% 22.3% administrative expenses Amortization of trademark license and trademarks 61,888 54,558 507,488 13.4% (89.2%) Operating income 9,826,095 5,292,933 5,550,857 85.6% (4.6%) Operating income as a percent of net sales 8.9% 5.8% 6.9% Net nonoperating expense 67,013 227,758 518,602 (70.6%) (56.1%) Income before provision for income taxes 9,759,082 5,065,175 5,032,255 92.7% 0.7% Provision for income taxes 3,828,678 2,035,980 2,012,902 88.1% 1.1% Effective tax rate 39.2% 40.2% 40.0% Net income $ 5,930,404 $ 3,029,195 $ 3,019,353 95.8% 0.3% Net income as a percent of net sales 5.4% 3.3% 3.7% Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.58 $ 0.30 $ 0.30 93.3% 0.0% Diluted $ 0.55 $ 0.29 $ 0.29 89.7% 0.0% Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross sales were $138.5 million, an increase of $23.0 million or 19.9% higher than gross sales of $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to the introduction of new products and increased sales of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales." Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net sales were $110.4 million, an increase of $18.3 million or 19.9% higher than net sales of $92.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster Energy(TM) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, as well as increased sales of Natural Sodas, Junior Juice and, to a lesser extent, sparkling beverages. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of functional drinks, smoothies, E2O Energy Water, Energade(R) energy sports drinks, and childrens multi vitamin juice drinks as well as an increase in discounts, allowances and promotional payments. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $10.5 million or 31.7% over the $33.2 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 36.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net sales. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. 24 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $6.0 million or 21.5% over total operating expenses of $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales slightly increased to 30.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003, from 30.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively larger increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $6.0 million or 21.5% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling expenses were $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $4.0 million or 25.1% over selling expenses of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses, trade development activities including cooperative arrangements with our distributors, sponsorships and promotions, in store demonstrations and merchandise displays which was partially offset by decreased expenditures for graphic design. In addition, we incurred expenses of approximately $267,000 during 2003 in connection with our sponsorship of the Las Vegas Monorail as part of our efforts to promote our Monster product line. General and administrative expenses were $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $2.0 million or 16.6% over general and administrative expenses of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was slightly lower than general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll costs as we expanded our headcount, as well as fees paid for legal and accounting services and increased travel and insurance expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively lower increase in payroll costs. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $7,000 from amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of trademarks during the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating Income. Operating income was $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The $4.5 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. Net Nonoperating Expense. Net nonoperating expense was $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was $161,000 lower than net nonoperating expense of $228,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net nonoperating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $73,000, as compared to $231,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to decreased interest expense incurred on our borrowings which was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates. Interest and royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $6,000, as compared to interest income of $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2003. 25 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $3.8 million which was an increase of $1.8 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2003 was 39.2%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.2% for 2002 due to the increase in the apportionment of sales and related state taxes to various states outside of California. Net Income. Net income was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was an increase of $2.9 million as compared to net income of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $10.5 million increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating expense of $161,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $6.0 million and an increase in the provision of income taxes of $1.8 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross sales were $115.5 million, an increase of $15.8 million or 15.8% higher than gross sales of $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to the introduction of new products and increased sales of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales." Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net sales were $92.0 million, an increase of $11.3 million or 14.1% higher than net sales of $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster EnergyTM drink, which was introduced in April 2002, as well as increased sales of Natural Sodas, E2O Energy Water(R), which was introduced in June 2001, Energade(R) energy sports drinks, which were introduced in July 2001, apple juice, and Soy Smoothies, which were introduced in December 2001. We also benefited, to a lesser extent, from increased sales of the childrens multi vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice(R), which was acquired in May 2001, and smoothies in P.E.T. plastic bottles. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of Signature Soda, Hard e, functional drinks, teas, lemonades and cocktails and smoothies in cans as well as an increase in discounts, allowances and promotional payments, notably higher coupon costs. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $4.3 million or 15.2% over the $28.9 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002 which was slightly higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net sales. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products notably higher coupon costs. Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $4.7 million or 19.9% over total operating expenses of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.4 % for the year ended December 31, 2002, from 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively larger increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. 26 Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $5.1 million or 22.3% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002, from 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling expenses were $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $3.7 million or 29.9% over selling expenses of $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002, from 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses, advertising, point of sale materials and merchandise displays, in store demonstrations and graphic design. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenditures for premiums. General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.4 million or 13.3% over general and administrative expenses of $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002 which was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll costs, charitable contributions, fees paid for legal and accounting services and increased travel expenses as well as other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the comparatively lower increase in payroll costs. Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark license and trademarks was $55,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $452,000 from amortization of trademark license and trademarks of $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in amortization of trademark license and trademarks was due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002 (Note 1 of the financial statements) which eliminated amortization on indefinite lived intangible assets. Operating Income. Operating income was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The $258,000 decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to increased operating expenses, which was partially offset by increased gross profit. Net Nonoperating Expense. Net nonoperating expense was $228,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, which was $291,000 lower than net nonoperating expense of $519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net nonoperating expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $231,000, as compared to $528,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to decreased interest expense incurred on our borrowings which was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3,000, as compared to interest income of $9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a reduction in the cash available for investment during the year ended December 31, 2002. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $2.0 million which was comparable to the provision for income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2002 was 40.2%, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 40.0% for 2001. Net Income. Net income was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, which was comparable to net income for the year ended December 31, 2001. The $4.3 million increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating expense of $291,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 was offset by increased operating expenses of $4.7 million. 27 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2003, the Company had working capital of $17,196,000, compared to working capital of $14,950,000 as of December 31, 2002. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to net income earned after adjustments for certain noncash expenses, primarily depreciation and other amortization, amortization of trademark license and trademarks, and a decrease in deposits and other assets and an increase in deferred income taxes which was partially offset by payments made in reduction of long term debt and increased expenditures for the acquisition of property, trademark license and trademarks. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $5,484,000, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2,727,000 during 2002. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to decreases in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable, income taxes payable, accrued compensation, and accrued liabilities which was partially offset by increases in inventories. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademark licenses and trademarks, and repayment of our line of credit and accounts payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2,438,000 as compared to net cash used in investment activities of $92,000 in 2002. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to increased purchases of property and equipment and an increase in trademarks as well as a decrease in expenditures for deposits and other assets in 2003 which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, specific items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the Hansens(R) brand, as well as the introduction of new product lines. Net cash used in financing activities was $2,486,000 for the year ending December 31, 2003, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2,344,000 in 2002. The increase in net cash used in financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increased principal payments of long term debt, which was partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2003. HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank California ("Comerica"), consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. The utilization of the revolving line of credit by HBC was dependent upon certain levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventory from time to time. Such revolving line of credit and term loan are secured by substantially all of HBCs assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, trademark licenses and certain equipment. In accordance with the provisions of the credit facility, HBC can borrow up to $12.0 million under its line of credit, reducing to $6.0 million by September 2004. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through September 2005. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on banks base (prime) rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of HBC from time to time. At December 31, 2003, HBC had no balances outstanding under the credit facility and borrowing capacity available to the Company from Comerica under the credit facility was $7,800,000. The terms of the Companys line of credit contain certain financial covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements. The line of credit contains provisions under which applicable interest rates will be adjusted in increments based on the achievement of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its financial ratios and annual net income requirements and obtained a waiver from Comerica with regards to its capital expenditure limitations at December 31, 2003. 28 If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code, institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon the lien and security interest granted or for the sale of any or all collateral. Purchase obligations represent commitments made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. Other commitments represent our obligations under our agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company. See also "ITEM 1 SALES AND MARKETING." The following represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2003: Long Term Debt & Capital Lease Operating Purchase Other Obligations Leases Obligations Commitments Total Year ending December 31: 2004 $ 244,271 $ 893,359 $ 6,732,789 $ 750,000 $ 8,620,419 2005 211,484 970,359 7,259,120 250,000 8,690,963 2006 146,580 1,017,128 7,259,120 8,422,828 2007 1,030,218 1,460,000 2,490,218 2008 773,997 773,997 Thereafter 1,199,730 1,199,730 $ 602,335 $ 5,884,791 $ 22,711,029 $ 1,000,000 $ 30,198,155 Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment through December 31, 2004. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP".) GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long lived assets and trademarks and trademark licenses as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business.The following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: Trademark License and Trademarks Trademark license and trademarks primarily represent the Companys exclusive ownership of the Hansens(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and water and non beverage products. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R) trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R) trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite lived trademark licenses and trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademark licenses and trademarks over one to 25 years. 29 In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademark license and trademarks annually for impairment. We measure impairment by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the trademark license and trademarks. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. Based on our annual impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2003, the estimated fair values of trademark license and trademarks exceeded the carrying value. Long Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with managements estimates of the business risks. Annually, or earlier, if there is indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on managements best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2003. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademark license and trademarks, is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Managements assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenues data for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Advertising and Promotional Allowances The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports its customers with promotional allowances, a portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. In certain instances, a portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the Company. If the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent based on estimates, require adjustments. During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01 9 which requires certain sales promotions and customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales or as cost of goods sold. The Company has conformed its presentation of advertising and promotional allowances to comply with the provisions of EITF No. 01 9. Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Companys recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 30 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Companys estimated forecast of product demand and or its ability to sell the products concerned and production requirements. Demand for the Companys products can fluctuate significantly. Factors which could affect demand for the Companys products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers and or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, managements estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Income Taxes Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Companys judgment. If the Company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," an interpretation SFAS Nos. 5, 57 and 107, and rescission of FIN 34, "Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted such interpretation on November 1, 2002 with no material impact to the consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," an interpretation of ARB No. 51, and revised in December 2003. FIN 46(R) requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46(R) is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after December 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to December 31, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46(R) must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after March 15, 2004. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN 46(R) will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as the Company has no interests in variable interest entities. 31 In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," as amended by various FASB staff positions posted in October and November 2003, which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope which may have previously been reported as equity, as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities, which are subject to the provision of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2004. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. A case of food bars and cereals is defined as follows: o A fruit and grain bar and functional nutrition bar case equals ninety 1.76 ounce bars. o A natural cereal case equals ten 13 ounce boxes measured by volume. o An active nutrition bar case equals thirty two 1.4 ounce bars. The Companys quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansens products is California, which has a year long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansens products expands outside of California. The Company has not had sufficient experience with many its newer product introductions and consequently has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with such products. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products, soda concentrates and increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Forward Looking Statements The Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to shareholders and announcements. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and or the Companys existing credit facility, earnings per share growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are qualified by their terms and or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following: o Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities; o Decreased demand for our products resulting from changes in consumer preferences; o Changes in demand that are weather related, particularly in areas outside of California; o Competitive products and pricing pressures and the Companys ability to gain or maintain its share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors; 33 o The introduction of new products; o An inability to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives; o Laws and regulations, and or any changes therein, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws as well as the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, and regulations made thereunder or in connection therewith, as well as changes in any other food and drug laws, especially those that may affect the way in which the Companys products are marketed and or labeled and or sold, including the contents thereof, as well as laws and regulations or rules made or enforced by the Food and Drug Administration and or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and or Federal Trade Commission, and or certain state regulatory agencies; o Changes in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely and or adequate production of all or any of the Companys products; o The Companys ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales; o The Companys ability to penetrate new markets; o The marketing efforts of distributors of the Companys products, most of which distribute products that are competitive with the products of the Company; o Unilateral decisions by distributors, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the Companys products that they are carrying at any time; o The terms and or availability of the Companys credit facility and the actions of its creditors; o The effectiveness of the Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs; o Changes in product category consumption; o Unforeseen economic and political changes; o Possible recalls of the Companys products; and o The Companys ability to make suitable arrangements for the co packing of any of its products including, but not limited to, its energy and functional drinks in 8.3 ounce slim cans and 16 ounce cans, smoothies in 11.5 ounce cans, E2O Energy Water(R), Energade(R), Monster Energy(R) and Lost(R) energy drinks, soy smoothies, sparkling orangeades and lemonades in glass bottles and other products. The foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward looking statements. Forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 34 ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) which the Company is exposed to are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and changes in interest rates of the Companys long term debt. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2003, the majority of the Companys debt consisted of fixed rather than variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys cash requirements. If average interest rates were to increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2003, the net impact on the Companys pre tax earnings would have been insignificant.
