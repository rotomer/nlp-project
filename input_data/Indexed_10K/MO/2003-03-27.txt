Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) on pages 22 to 42 of the 2002 Annual Report and made a part hereof. Following a $10.1 billion judgment on March 21, 2003 against PM USA in the Price litigation described in Item 3, the judge granted PM USAs request for a stay of enforcement of the judgment for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, under the judgment, enforcement will be stayed only if an appeal bond in the amount of $12 billion is presented and approved. PM USA believes that requiring a bond in such an amount, in order to stay execution pending appeal, would be unconstitutional and would also violate Illinois law. It is not possible for PM USA to post such a bond and, absent judicial or legislative relief, PM USA would not be able to stay enforcement of the judgment in Illinois. PM USA will take all appropriate steps to seek to prevent this from occurring. As a result of these developments, the three major credit rating agencies placed ALGs credit ratings on watch with negative implications. While Kraft is not a party to, and has no exposure to, this litigation, its credit ratings are affected by those of ALG and, accordingly, its ratings were also placed on watch with negative implications. The rating agencies actions are expected to result in higher short term borrowing costs for ALG and Kraft. None of ALGs or Krafts debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in the MD&A captioned Market Risk and Value at Risk on pages 39 to 40 of the 2002 Annual Report and made a part hereof.
