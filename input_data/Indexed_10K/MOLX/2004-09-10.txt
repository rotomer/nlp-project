Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Highlights and Outlook Revenue for the current fiscal year of $2.25 billion increased 21.9 percent over last year. The Company achieved a record level of revenue of $632 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Net income for the year of $176.0 million increased $91.1 million from $84.9 million reported in the prior year. Last years net income included a charge of $40.1 million ($28.6 million after tax) for restructuring costs and write off of investments. Molex remains focused on striving for efficiencies in costs and productivity while pushing for growth through continued investment in new product development. Outlook The outlook in the majority of the Companys global markets remains strong. While demand beyond the short term remains difficult to predict, the Company is pleased with the level of orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and believes that the higher order backlog will provide a tailwind heading into the new fiscal year. During fiscal 2005, Molex will continue to focus on delivering additional profit leverage and increasing market share. The Company expects revenue growth of 16 percent to 19 percent during fiscal 2005 and net income is expected to grow faster than revenues due to leverage from the higher volume. Earnings per share are expected in the range of $1.24 to $1.34, an increase of 35 percent to 45 percent. To further expand the Companys global presence in low cost locations and to offer innovative products at an accelerated pace, Molex plans to invest $215 million to $225 million in capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. The Company continues to emphasize expansion in markets such as automotive, industrial and medical, while working to further strengthen its significant position as a leader in the computer and digital consumer markets. Molex remains committed to providing high quality products and a full range of services to customers wherever they may be located in the world. Investor Returns Molex is committed to providing shareholders with a competitive return on their investment. The Companys total shareholder return (including reinvestment of dividends) over the last five years has averaged an annual compounded return of 1.9 percent on Molex Common Stock and 2.0 percent on Molex Class A Common Stock. Over the last ten years, the compounded annual return has averaged 10.2 percent on Molex Common Stock and 8.8 percent on Molex Class A Common Stock. A $100 investment in Molex Common Stock at June 30, 1999, together with the reinvestment of dividends, would be worth $110 at June 30, 2004, and a similar investment in Molex Class A Common Stock would be worth $110 at June 30, 2004.

The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $89 million in fiscal 2004. Customer revenue in the Americas region was $686.1 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of 7.0 percent compared with last years revenue of $641.2 million, with the growth occurring during the second half of the fiscal year. The revenue growth in this region was due to a broad improvement across all markets led by a recovering economy and strong consumer confidence in the U.S. In the Far East North region, customer revenue grew 22.4 percent to $499.3 million in fiscal 2004 compared to revenue of $407.8 million last year. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $33 million to this increase. Demand for advanced digital home entertainment products such as digital still cameras, camcorders and flat screen and plasma TVs, as well as high end mobile phones was especially strong. Revenue also improved in the industrial market, especially for semiconductor inspection equipment and industrial automation. Customer revenue for fiscal 2004 was $623.6 million in the Far East South region, an increase of $164.8 million, or 35.9 percent, compared with the prior year. The biggest drivers of this growth were American, European and Japanese companies moving production to China and strong demand in the consumer electronics, cell phone and notebook and desktop computer markets. In Europe, customer revenue in fiscal 2004 was $385.1 million, an increase of 32.3 percent, as compared to $291.0 million in fiscal 2003. During the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company purchased the assets and business of French based Connecteurs Cinch SA (Cinch) and its subsidiaries. Cinch added revenues of $20.5 million during fiscal 2004. Foreign currency translation, led by the strong euro, also increased customer revenues by approximately $44.5 million. 10 As discussed below under the caption Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded pretax charges of $35.0 million ($24.8 million after tax) for restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Charges of $28.5 million were recorded in cost of sales and the remaining charge of $6.5 million was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2004, the Company realized savings of approximately $16 million related to the fiscal 2003 restructuring actions of which approximately 75 percent is reflected in fiscal 2004 cost of sales. For additional information concerning the status of the Companys restructuring programs see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Gross profit was $776.7 million for fiscal 2004, up $197.5 million, or 34.1 percent over the prior year. Gross profit margin was 34.6 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2004, an increase from 31.4 percent in fiscal 2003. Excluding restructuring costs of $28.5 million from fiscal 2003, gross profit margin was 33.0 percent. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volumes. The realized savings from last years restructuring program also contributed to the improvement. Offsetting these improvements, the Company estimates that it paid approximately $10 million more in fiscal 2004 for metal strip and gold purchases. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $555.6 million were up 16.5 percent, or $78.6 million, over the prior year. Foreign currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $23 million. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 25.9 percent in fiscal 2003 to 24.7 percent in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 results included severance costs of $6.5 million related to workforce reductions, as previously noted. Research and development expenditures were $119.0 million, or 5.3 percent of net revenue, during fiscal 2004, compared with $117.0 million, or 6.3 percent of net revenue, in the prior year. During fiscal 2004, the Company adopted a more narrow definition of research and development. This change had the effect of reducing reported research and development spending in fiscal 2004 by approximately $18 million compared with the prior year. Research and development expenditures in fiscal 2004 contributed to the release of 415 new products during the year. In fiscal 2004, 25.1 percent of net revenue was derived from the sale of products released by the Company within the last three years. Molex continued its long term commitment to reinvesting its profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance the Companys competitive position. The Company was granted 568 new patents during the year. Other (income) expense for fiscal 2004 included a pretax gain of $10.4 million from the sale of stock of an affiliate and an equity gain resulting from an IPO completed by the affiliate. Molex retains a 20 percent ownership in this affiliate. In addition, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $5.0 million to exit other investments in start up technologies. Interest income, net of interest expense, was $3.7 million for fiscal 2004 compared with $8.2 million in the prior year period. The prior year included an interest benefit of approximately $3.0 million from the favorable closure of tax audits in several U.S. jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 26.5 percent for fiscal 2004 compared with 22.5 percent in fiscal 2003. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily the result of an increase in the Companys pretax earnings from higher rate jurisdictions. The Company continues its ongoing global effort to reduce its income tax expense through a disciplined repatriation strategy and planning. Net income rose to $176.0 million during fiscal 2004 from $84.9 million reported in fiscal 2003. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed $4.7 million to net income. Fiscal 2003 net income included an after tax charge of $28.6 million for restructuring costs and the write down of certain investments. Diluted earnings per share was $0.92 for fiscal 2004 compared with $0.44 for fiscal 2003. 11 Comprehensive income includes all non shareholder changes in equity and consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The increase in comprehensive income for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to net income and favorable foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the weaker U.S. dollar versus the yen and euro. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2003 net revenue was $1.84 billion, a 7.7 percent increase from $1.71 billion reported in the prior year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of $67.8 million, the increase was 3.7 percent, with the strongest growth occurring during the first half of the year. Customer revenue in the Americas region was $641.2 million, a decline of 3.8 percent from fiscal 2002 revenue of $666.3 million. While the Americas experienced growth in the connector products and industrial markets, lack of demand in the telecommunications infrastructure and fiber optics markets impeded overall revenue growth in this region. In the Far East North, customer revenue rose 16.0 percent during fiscal 2003 to $407.8 million compared with $351.5 million in the prior year. Foreign currency translation increased revenue by $20.9 million. Excluding the favorable currency impact, growth in this region was driven by the successful design in of new products serving the consumer electronics market in products such as digital still and video cameras, mobile phones and plasma TVs. Customer revenue during fiscal 2003 in the Far East South region increased to $458.8 million, an increase of $92.5 million, or 25.2 percent. Strong demand in the personal computer market led the growth as more motherboards, desktop and notebook PCs and peripherals were produced in the region. Successful new product developments in this area positioned Molex for continued growth. This is particularly important as customers continue to transfer business into the Far East South region and competition grows in the computer market. The European region experienced a 4.1 percent increase in customer revenue to $291.0 million in fiscal 2003 from $279.5 million in fiscal 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation of $40.8 million, revenues declined by 11 percent. Europe entered the global recession after the other three regions and remains behind in the economic cycle. Although the telecom market was severely impacted, this region did realize growth in the automotive and industrial markets. As a result of continuing weak demand in the telecommunications infrastructure market, the Company implemented several actions in the Americas and Europe to address the competitive challenges in this market. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded pretax restructuring costs totaling $35.0 million ($24.8 million after tax) related to these actions. These charges comprised $23.1 million relating to write down and impairment of manufacturing assets and $11.9 million for severance and other benefits relating to workforce reductions of 537 people. The Company estimates annual pretax savings of approximately $20 million related to these restructuring actions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company implemented a plan to reduce fixed costs through workforce reductions and closure of some smaller operations and recorded a pretax charge of $24.2 million of which $12.6 million is included in cost of sales and $11.6 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company estimates that annualized savings related to this plan were approximately $16 million and approximately 55 percent of the savings were achieved in fiscal 2002. For more information concerning the status of the Companys restructuring programs see Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 12 Gross profit was $579.2 million for fiscal 2003, up $42.7 million, or 8.0 percent over the prior year. The resulting gross profit margin was 31.4 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003, an increase from 31.3 percent reported in fiscal 2002, largely due to a more favorable product mix, as well as lower prices for raw materials and purchased components. Fiscal 2003 gross profit was also impacted by $28.5 million of the aforementioned fourth quarter charge for manufacturing related employment reductions and asset write downs. Fiscal 2002 gross profit included restructuring costs of $12.6 million. During the year, the Company also focused on and was successful in reducing operating costs and achieving operating efficiencies through consolidating functions, streamlining processes, downsizing facilities and controlling discretionary spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $477.0 million were up 8.8 percent, or $38.4 million, over the prior year, and as a percentage of net revenue increased from 25.6 percent in fiscal 2002 to 25.9 percent in fiscal 2003. The Company implemented temporary salary reductions and reduced its discretionary profit sharing contributions during fiscal 2002, in response to the business downturn. Effective July 1, 2002, the Company reinstated employee salaries and profit sharing contributions back to the levels before the temporary reduction. The Company estimates that these actions resulted in a savings of approximately $15 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 also included $6.5 million of the fourth quarter restructuring charge for employment reductions in selling and administrative areas and fiscal 2002 included similar costs of $11.6 million. Research and development expenditures were $117.0 million, or 6.3 percent of net revenue, during fiscal 2003, compared with $111.8 million, or 6.5 percent of net revenue, in the prior year. These expenditures contributed to the release of 339 new products during the year. In fiscal 2003, 25.7 percent of net revenue was derived from the sale of products released by the Company within the prior three years. The Company was granted 529 new patents during the year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company discontinued the marketing and production of certain product families dedicated to the telecom industry and wrote off the related licenses. Molex also wrote down its investment in a joint venture that was engaged in the development of similar technology. Other (income) expense for fiscal 2003 included a pretax charge of $5.1 million ($3.8 million after tax) related to these actions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, Molex recorded a pretax charge of $10.0 million ($6.5 million after tax) to reflect the lower current value of its investment in an affiliate. Net interest income was $8.2 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $2.2 million over the prior year, primarily due to an interest benefit from the favorable closure of corporate tax audits in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as additional interest on the Companys higher cash balances. The effective income tax rate was 22.5 percent for fiscal 2003 compared with 17.9 percent in fiscal 2002. The rate for fiscal 2002 includes a one time tax benefit of $5.0 million related to closure of an operation in Europe. This benefit reduced the effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 by five percentage points. Net income grew 11.0 percent during fiscal 2003 to $84.9 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, which had a minimal impact, net income was up 10.5 percent. Fiscal 2003 net income includes a charge of $28.6 million (net of tax benefit of $11.5 million) to reflect costs associated with employment reductions and write offs of manufacturing assets and certain investments. Fiscal 2002 net income includes a charge of $25.3 million (net of tax benefit of $8.9 million) for employment reductions and asset write downs and impairment of an investment. Earnings per share was $0.44 during fiscal 2003 compared with $0.39 during fiscal 2002. Comprehensive income includes all non shareholder changes in equity and consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities and a required minimum pension liability adjustment in fiscal 2003. The change in comprehensive income for the year was primarily due to net income and foreign currency translation adjustments. During fiscal 2003, the U.S. dollar was weaker versus the euro when compared with the prior year, resulting in an increase in comprehensive income. 13 Financial Condition and Liquidity Molexs financial position remains strong and is increasingly cited by customers as a source of significant competitive advantage. The Company is consistently able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2004 totaled $338.7 million and $350.2 million at June 30, 2003. The Companys long term financing strategy is to rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Management remains confident that the Companys liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current, as well as future growth. Molex has historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists. Long term debt at June 30, 2004 totaled $10.2 million. The Company has available lines of credit totaling $141.5 million. Cash Flows Cash provided from operating activities and cash used for investing activities has been restated in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended June 30, 2003. See Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Cash provided from operations for fiscal 2004 was $292.0 million, down from $304.9 million in fiscal 2003. Despite an increase in net income of $91.0 million, cash from operations decreased by $12.9 million from fiscal 2003 due mainly to increased working capital levels. As a result of higher customer revenue during fiscal 2004, accounts receivable balances increased. The Company also increased inventory levels in fiscal 2004 to support the higher volume, although this increase was partially offset by higher accounts payable balances. Cash used for investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $249.2 million in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures increased to $189.7 million in fiscal 2004 from $171.2 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2004, Molex added a new facility in China and closed or sold facilities in Puerto Rico, U.S., United Kingdom and Slovakia. The Company purchased the assets and business of Cinch for $37.9 million during fiscal 2004. As part of the Cinch acquisition, Molex acquired facilities in France, Portugal, India and China. The Company also decreased its level of investment in marketable securities during fiscal 2004. Cash used for financing activities was $86.1 million in fiscal 2004 down from $92.3 million in the prior year. Cash was used primarily for the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury stock. The Company purchased 2,740,000 shares of Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2004 and 3,352,500 shares during fiscal 2003. Molex has a strong cash balance and cash flow and very little debt. The Company believes at this time that share repurchases are a good investment as compared to investing its cash in short term money instruments or marketable securities, particularly with the current low interest rates. The Company also uses shares repurchased to replenish stock used for exercises of employee stock options, employee stock awards and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Companys Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of as much as $100 million of Common and or Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2005. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments As of June 30, 2004, the Company is contractually obligated to make future payments as follows (in thousands): Contractual Obligations Due There by Fiscal Year: 2005 2006 2007 2008 after Long term debt $ 904 $2,958 $1,017 $ 908 $ 5,360 Capital lease obligations 3,232 2,265 1,179 268 454 Operating leases 8,171 4,592 3,019 1,828 8,535 Total contractual obligations $12,307 $9,815 $5,215 $3,004 $14,349 14 Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements. The significant accounting principles that management believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding the Companys financial results are included below. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the Company. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. A reserve for doubtful accounts is recorded generally based on a percentage of aged receivables and managements evaluation of customer credit risk. Management judgment is utilized in assessing customer creditworthiness, changes in customer payment history, historical bad debt experience and economic and market trends. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to these reserves. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. The Company has net deferred tax assets of $139.8 million at June 30, 2004. In assessing the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers future forecasted taxable income and tax planning strategies. The Company has determined that it is unlikely that it will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. A valuation allowance of $7.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2004 to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of $7.3 million related to certain European net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $26 million at June 30, 2004. The Company has operations in several countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts to be recorded by the Company involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how the foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although the Companys management believes its tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. Allowance for Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out ("FIFO") cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. 15 Pension Plans The Companys pension obligations are measured as of March 31 for the U.S. plan and as of June 30 for the international plans. International plans are primarily in Japan, Ireland, Taiwan and Korea. The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) as of June 30 and pension expense for the years ended June 30 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans PBO as of June 30: Discount rate 5.75% 3.6% 6.25% 3.1% 7.25% 3.6% Rate of compensation increase 3.5% 3.6% 3.5% 2.9% 4.0% 3.2% Pension expense for the years ended June 30: Discount rate 6.25% 3.1% 7.25% 3.6% 7.25% 4.0% Expected return on plan assets 8.5% 6.5% 9.0% 6.4% 9.0% 6.9% Rate of compensation increase 3.5% 2.9% 4.0% 3.2% 4.5% 2.3% The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The Company has typically used the corporate AA/Aa bond rate for this assumption. The expected return on plan assets noted above represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. The Company has estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, for the Companys pension plans as of June 30, 2004, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 0.5 point $(3,636) $(8,446) $(271) $(448) Decrease 0.5 point 3,186 7,302 304 494 Expected rate of return change: Increase 1.0 point N/A N/A (261) (250) Decrease 1.0 point N/A N/A 261 250 The Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of growing plan assets and keeping risks at a reasonable level over a long term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset classes with a focus on total return. The weighted average asset allocations for the Companys pension plans at June 30 are as follows: 2004 2003 U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Asset allocation: Equity 62% 67% 39% 59% Bonds 38% 28% 61% 32% Real estate and other N/A 5% N/A 9% The expected benefit payments from the Companys pension plans are as follows: $3.4 million in 2005; $3.1 million in 2006; $3.4 million in 2007; $4.8 million in 2008; $4.2 million in 2009 and $16.1 million in 2010 to 2014. The Company expects to contribute $3.7 million in fiscal 2005 to its pension plans. 16 Other Postretirement Benefits The Company has retiree health care plans that cover the majority of its U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The Company measures its retiree health care benefit obligations as of March 31. The weighted average assumptions used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) as of June 30 and benefit expense for the years ended June 30 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 APBO as of June 30: Discount rate 5.75% 6.25% 7.25% Health care cost trend rate 10.0% 10.0% 8.0% Ultimate health care cost trend rate 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Years to ultimate rate 2009 2008 2007 Benefit expense for the years ended June 30: Discount rate 6.25% 7.25% 7.25% Health care cost trend rate 10.0% 8.0% 6.3% Ultimate health care cost trend rate 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Years to ultimate rate 2008 2007 2006 The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the APBO and retiree health care benefit expense. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Effect on total service and interest cost: Increase 1.0 point $ 714 $ 407 $ 445 Decrease 1.0 point $ (600) $ (317) $ (344) Effect on APBO: Increase 1.0 point $ 6,277 $ 5,942 $ 2,734 Decrease 1.0 point $(5,279) $(4,654) $(2,169) Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company reviews at least annually the realizability of goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including, but not limited to, projected economic conditions and customer demand, manufacturing capacity, operating costs and new products introduced. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" that was effective for the Companys fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. This revised statement impacts disclosure provisions only and requires additional disclosures about plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit costs for pension plans and postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 8 and 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the aforementioned disclosures. 17 The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Accounting guidance has been provided by the FASB in FSP No. 106 2 "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003". Molex has determined that the benefits provided by its plan are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Company has elected to use the retroactive approach to reflect the federal subsidy that will be provided by the Medicare Act and accordingly has remeasured plan liabilities and expense as of December 31, 2003. See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of this election. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. The Company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets it serves and invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products. Molex also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and occasional use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of intercompany cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2004 and 2003. The Company has implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, the Company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows. The Companys $104.2 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2004 are principally debt instruments that generate interest income for the Company on temporary excess cash balances. These instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling the Company to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date. The Companys exposure related to derivative instrument transactions is, in the aggregate, not material to Molexs financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest rate exposure is limited to marketable securities owned by the Company and long term debt. The Company does not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of its investments, less than 12 months, and the fixed rate nature of its long term debt. Molex does not have exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of certain operating leases. See Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Companys lease arrangements. Due to the nature of its operations, Molex is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. The Company monitors the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates. Molex has implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during its manufacturing process and believes it continues to meet or exceed local government regulations. 18
