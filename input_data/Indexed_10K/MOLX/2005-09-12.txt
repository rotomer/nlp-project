Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Molexs core business is the manufacture and sale of electromechanical components. Molexs products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. The Company designs, manufactures and sells more than 100,000 products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. Molex also provides manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. Molex connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, computer, consumer products, automotive and industrial markets. The Companys products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and plasma televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. Net revenues by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and new products or model changes introduced by Molex or its customers. The approximate percentage of net revenue by market for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 is outlined below. Certain changes have been made to previously reported 2004 and 2003 information to conform to the Companys current classification of customers into its market definitions. % of Net Revenue Markets: 2005 2004 2003 Telecommunications 27 % 23 % 21 % Data Products 24 26 27 Automotive 19 17 19 Consumer 18 21 21 Industrial 9 10 9 Other 3 3 3 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Molex believes that its sales mix is balanced, with growth prospects in a number of markets. During the last two years, the Company has experienced higher growth rates in the telecommunications market, which includes mobile phones, networking and transmission equipment and slower growth in automotive and consumer products. Molex sells its products directly to OEMs and to their subcontractors and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors throughout the world. Molex engineers work collaboratively with customers to develop products that meet their specific needs. The Companys connector products are designed to help manufacturers assemble their own products more efficiently. Molexs electronic components help enable manufacturers to break down their production into sub assemblies that can be built on different production lines, in different factories or by subcontractors. The Companys connectors allow these sub assemblies to be readily plugged together before selling the end product to a customer. Molex connectors also enable users to connect together related electronic items, such as mobile phones to battery chargers and computers to printers. Many Molex customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. 16 Molex services its customers through its global manufacturing footprint. As of June 30, 2005, the Company operated 58 manufacturing plants, located in 19 countries on five continents. Manufacturing in many sectors has continued to move from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced the need for duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, Molexs strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world. In April 2005, Molex announced a plan to realign part of its manufacturing capacity that is expected to result in the closing of seven plants in five countries. Molex operates its business in four geographic regions. In 2005, 51% of the Companys revenue was derived from sales in Asia. Economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, is anticipated to be greater than in the Americas and Europe. The Companys management believes that it has positioned the business to benefit from this trend. Approximately 40% of Molexs manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. The market in which the Company operates is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. Molex is currently the worlds second largest manufacturer of electronic connectors. Molex believes that its global presence and its ability to design and manufacture its products throughout the world and to service its customers globally is a key advantage for the Company. The Companys growth has come primarily from new products that it develops, often in collaboration with its customers. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2005 of $2.55 billion increased 13.4% over fiscal 2004 net revenue of $2.25 billion. Net revenue in local currencies increased 10.2%. Net income for the year of $154.4 million decreased $21.6 million from $176.0 million reported in the prior year. This years net income included a restructuring charge of $27.9 million ($21.6 million after tax), a goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million ($22.9 million after tax) and an asset impairment charge of $2.3 million ($1.4 million after tax). On April 25, 2005, the Company announced a plan to realign part of its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize plant utilization and to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. Molex recorded a pre tax charge of $27.9 million in the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and is anticipating an additional estimated pre tax charge of $15 million to $25 million during fiscal 2006 in connection with this plan. Cash expenditures through June 30, 2005 in connection with the restructuring were $3.8 million, consisting primarily of severance and other employee related costs. Implementation of this restructuring program began in the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and is expected to continue through fiscal 2006. During the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company performed its annual impairment review and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the Companys Molex Premise Networks (MPN) business unit. The Company also recorded in the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter an asset impairment charge of $2.3 million to reflect the expected sale price, less costs of disposition, of a U.S. property that is held for sale. This building was previously used for manufacturing and warehousing of fiber optic products that were consolidated into other facilities. In connection with the resignation of its former auditor, responses to SEC comment inquiries, and internal investigations authorized by the Companys Audit Committee, the Company estimates that legal, accounting and other costs during fiscal 2005 increased by approximately $9.9 million. These results do not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options according to SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. If the Company had applied SFAS No. 123(R) to its results for the year ended June 30, 2005, net income would have been reduced by approximately $10 million. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2006 as required by that standard. 17 Outlook Molex believes that the outlook of the global markets remains favorable. During fiscal 2006, Molex will continue to focus on delivering additional profit leverage and increasing its market share. The Company expects net revenue growth of 5% to 8% during fiscal 2006. The Company estimates that net revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 will be in a range of $2.675 billion to $2.750 billion. The Company anticipates that its growth in fiscal 2006 will be led by the Far East North and Far East South regions, while business in the Americas and Europe is expected to increase modestly. The Company expects strong demand for digital consumer products, including high definition televisions and digital audio players, hand held devices and data storage products. In the industrial and distribution markets, the Company expects solid growth, and in the telecom infrastructure and automotive markets, the Company expects growth to be below the average for the overall connector market. Molex also expects to continue to increase sales in the medical and commercial military markets. Based on these net revenue expectations, earnings per share for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, including a pre tax restructuring charge expected to be between $15.0 million and $25.0 million, are estimated to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.12. The reduction in earnings per share from the restructuring charge is estimated to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.09. In addition, the earnings per share estimate includes the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) requiring the expensing of stock option costs. This non cash accounting charge is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2006 earnings per share by approximately $0.05. Management currently expects the effective tax rate to decrease to approximately 28.5% for fiscal 2006 compared with 28.8% in 2005. The Companys current restructuring activities are expected to be substantially completed during fiscal 2006. However, the actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions remain dependent upon a number of factors, including the Companys efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production and obtaining customer approvals particularly in the automotive market. Molex expects that the pre tax savings from these restructuring activities will be in the range of $10 million to $15 million for fiscal 2006. These savings are after transition costs to be incurred in relocating manufacturing assets, and the costs of increased direct labor headcount at the facilities where production is being transferred. In total, Molex expects to terminate approximately 1,400 employees globally, and to add back approximately 800 employees, for a net reduction of approximately 600 employees. The cost savings are expected to be heavily weighted toward the end of fiscal 2006, by whic h time the plant relocations should be substantially completed. As a result, the expected cost benefit in fiscal 2007 is substantially greater than in fiscal 2006. The estimated full year impact for fiscal 2007 of these savings is expected to be in the range of $32 million to $40 million. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the fiscal period in which the accounting charge is taken. The Company estimates capital spending in fiscal 2006 to be in a range of $220 million to $240 million, primarily for investment in production assets including molds, dies and assembly equipment, and for the planned expansion in lower cost locations such as China and Poland. The only significant planned new plant location is a seventh manufacturing facility in China, to be located in the southwest region. Molexs continued success is dependent on technological advancement, including developing strategic products for specific markets. Research and development spending in fiscal 2006 is estimated to be in a range of $145 million to $155 million, almost entirely for new product development. Critical Accounting Estimates The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates communicated below with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys related disclosures herein. 18 Molexs significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Molexs revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) and other applicable guidance. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. The Company assesses whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. The Company has net deferred tax assets of $143.5 million at June 30, 2005. The Company has operations in several countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts to be recorded by the Company involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although the Companys management believes its tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. The Company periodically assesses the carrying value of its deferred tax assets based upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If the Company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. The Company has determined that it is unlikely that it will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. A valuation allowance of $5.6 million was recorded in fiscal 2005 to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of $5.6 million related to certain European net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $28.7 million at June 30, 2005. It is the Companys policy to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. The Company establishes the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable contingencies. At June 30, 2005, the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable contingencies. To the extent the Company was to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of accruals, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be affected. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If Molexs sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and the Company fails to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, it could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. 19 Pension Plans The costs and obligations of the Companys defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the benefit obligation, are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The Company has typically used the market rate for AA/Aa rated corporate bonds for this assumption. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. The Company has estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for the Companys pension plans as of June 30, 2005, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (4,334 ) $ (9,729 ) $ (338 ) $ (345 ) Decrease 50 basis points 3,974 8,447 356 372 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A $ (340 ) $ (305 ) Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A 340 305 Other Postretirement Benefits The Company has retiree health care plans that cover the majority of its U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. A 100 basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Effect on total service and interest cost: Increase 100 basis points $ 1,073 $ 714 $ 407 Decrease 100 basis points (908 ) (600 ) (317 ) Effect on APBO: Increase 100 basis points $ 8,655 $ 6,277 $ 5,942 Decrease 100 basis points (7,325 ) (5,279 ) (4,654 ) Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31st, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value. Molexs impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. 20 The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, the Company makes certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs Molex has recorded charges in connection with restructuring its business. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, the Company recognizes a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of Molexs restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized over a number of accounting periods. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from Company estimates, the future amount of restructuring charges could be different than those projected. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company assesses the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of the Companys use of the asset, changes in historical or projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. 21 Results of Operations Year Ended June 30, 2005 Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2004 Year Over Year Over Years Ended Year Year Results as % June 30, $ Change % Change of Net Revenue (in thousands) Favorable Favorable 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2005 2004 Net revenue $ 2,548,652 $ 2,246,715 $ 301,937 13.4 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 1,675,308 1,469,969 (205,339 ) (14.0 ) 65.7 65.4 Gross profit 873,344 776,746 96,598 12.4 34.3 34.6 Selling, general & administrative 622,954 555,563 (67,391 ) (12.1 ) 24.5 24.7 Restructuring costs 27,875 (27,875 ) (100.0 ) 1.1 Goodwill and asset impairments 25,169 (25,169 ) (100.0 ) 1.0 Income from operations 197,346 221,183 (23,837 ) (10.8 ) 7.7 9.9 Other (income) expense, net (19,541 ) (18,709 ) 832 4.4 0.8 0.8 Income before income taxes 216,887 239,892 (23,005 ) (9.6 ) 8.5 10.7 Income taxes & minority interest 62,453 63,942 1,489 2.3 2.4 2.9 Net income $ 154,434 $ 175,950 $ (21,516 ) (12.2 ) % 6.1 % 7.8 % Net revenue The acquisition of French based Connecteurs Cinch S.A. and its subsidiaries (Cinch) completed in April, 2004, added $30.2 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2005. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and the yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $72.1 million over the prior year period. The Company estimates that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $88 million for fiscal 2005, compared with the prior year. The balance of the revenue increase came primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products, and sales of new products. Revenue derived from the sale of new products released by the Company within the last 36 months was $764 million, or 30% of total revenue, in the current year, compared with $563 million, or 25% of revenue, for the prior year. The following table sets forth information on the Companys net revenue by geographic regions for the periods indicated: Year Over Year Over Years Ended Year Year Results as % June 30, $ Change % Change of Net Revenue (in thousands) Favorable Favorable 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2005 2004 Americas $ 701,470 $ 686,129 $ 15,341 2.2 % 27.5 % 30.5 % Far East North 523,717 499,348 24,369 4.9 20.5 22.2 Far East South 769,218 623,619 145,599 23.3 30.2 27.8 Europe 504,453 385,051 119,402 31.0 19.8 17.1 Corp. and Other 49,794 52,568 (2,774 ) (5.3 ) 2.0 2.4 Total $ 2,548,652 $ 2,246,715 $ 301,937 13.4 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Americas Region North and South America Customer revenue in the Americas region for fiscal 2005 increased 2.2% from the prior year, due to a slightly stronger demand for electronic connector products, particularly in high performance products, including cable assemblies for the high end server market in supercomputer applications. The Company has also seen some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. 22 Modest sales growth reflects the accelerated movement offshore of OEMs and contract manufacturers. Although management believes that most of the related revenue remained within Molex, it contributed to sales in other regions and reduced the Americas results. The revenue loss was partially offset with an increase in distribution sales, industrial sales and new product sales. Integrated product sales grew at a faster rate than connector products, with the most significant increase from high performance cables and fiber optics products for computer and industrial market applications, as well as for the telecommunications market, which has finally stabilized. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Customer revenue in the Far East North region in fiscal 2005 increased 4.9% from the prior year in U.S. dollars and remained steady in local currencies. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $24 million to the revenue increase. A robust business environment in Japan, a recovering economy in Korea and a steady flow of new products stimulated sales. New products generated 35% of fiscal 2005 revenue. The most significant growth in fiscal 2005 for Japan came from advanced digital home entertainment products such as digital still cameras and portable audio players and from consumer electronics products such as game machines and plasma display panels for flat screen TVs. Growth also came from hard disk drives and printers for the computer market. During the year, the region further capitalized on its ability to design more compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as TV and camera functionality. As more global phone makers move to 3G technology, Molex believes the region is well positioned to grow. Revenue to the industrial market increased, largely due to servo motor demand and customer investment in new semiconductor equipment. Automotive design wins in Japan were offset by decreased demand from Korean automakers due to Koreas sluggish economy. In Korea, modest strength in the electronics industry and the overall connector market was offset by reduced sales of personal computers. Revenue from integrated products grew at a faster rate than connector products in fiscal 2005. To counter pricing pressure, most integrated products are manufactured in Molexs plant in Dalian, China, which underwent a 60% capacity expansion in fiscal 2005. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased 23.3% in fiscal 2005 in U.S. dollars, 22.0% in local currencies, compared with the prior year. This region is now the Companys largest and fastest growing segment. Favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $8 million had a modest impact on revenue. The revenue growth in this region, which represents 30% of the Companys customer revenue, was driven by strong demand across the consumer products and computer markets, as well as the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market. The Companys sales in China increased by 23% as a result of customer demand supported by increased production capacity. The biggest drivers of this growth were American, European and Japanese companies moving their design and production to China and greater penetration of Taiwanese multinational accounts. Molex experienced strong demand in the mobile phone, notebook and desktop computer, consumer electronics and automotive markets. Products used in mobile phones constitute nearly one third of Far East South sales. Consumer electronics is another important market for the region. During the year, new products were introduced to keep pace with the ongoing migration from analog to digital technology. The region is coordinating opportunities with its Molex counterparts in Japan to have these products designed in the Far East North and produced in China. 23 In the data, networking and computing arena, the Company shifted its focus from telecommunications infrastructure equipment to the far stronger server market. The region also grew in its traditional niche of personal computers and notebooks. The automotive business in the Far East South region, although still in its early stages, is accelerating. The Companys product pipeline grew to five times the 2004 level. The Big 3 (Daimler Chrysler, Ford and General Motors) and their suppliers moving to China want local design, procurement and production, which the region can provide. The Company plans to open a new plant in summer 2007 in Chengdu, considered the Detroit of China. The new plant is expected to be Molexs largest worldwide and manufacture products for the automotive industry and for other industries as well. To offer customers a complete solution, the region maintains a balance between high precision, high technology manufacturing in Singapore and commoditized capability in China. European Region Customer revenue in Europe for fiscal 2005 increased 31.0% from the prior year in U.S. dollars and 22.0% in local currencies. The Companys Cinch automotive acquisition, which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, accounted for $30.2 million of the $119.4 million in growth. Foreign currency translation, led by the strong euro, also favorably impacted customer revenue in Europe by approximately $35 million. The remaining revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by demand for mobile phones in the telecommunications market and products in the industrial market. The European connector market has been growing, albeit at a single digit pace. The region is focused on the strongest markets that Molex believes are most likely to stay in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Integrated products now account for approximately 25% of the regions revenue. During the year, the region won projects from customers engaged in land and marine based oil exploration, as well as manufacturers requiring Molex products for industrial controls, testing equipment and power management. The region also increased its business with Nokia, the only major mobile phone company still producing in Europe. Management believes that the trend for European automakers, at least for the next five years, will be locally based and will rely on local distribution. Molex believes the region is in a good position to fulfill this need with a broad connector product offering and a robust new product pipeline. Key initiatives in the region include improving capacity utilization, shifting more manufacturing to the regions Eastern European locations, and using Six Sigma methodology to eliminate waste and enhance quality. Additionally, Molex is ahead of schedule with introducing lead free products and expects that it will deliver well in advance of the European compliance deadline. Gross Profit Gross profit was $873.3 million for the year, up $96.6 million, or 12.4% over the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 34.3% of net revenue, down from 34.6% in the prior year. The Company was not able to fully offset the negative impact of price erosion discussed earlier with the leverage on the higher sales volume. The gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs. The Company estimates that it paid approximately $17 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in the current year compared with the same period last year. Although Molex implemented offsetting price increases to its distribution sales channel, it has not been as successful with the majority of its business. Molexs client mix skews toward large global customers and industries that make raising prices more difficult. Certain products manufactured by Molex in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closel y linked to the U.S. dollar. The gross profit margin was negatively impacted as the yen and euro strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company estimates this currency transaction impact to be approximately $6.5 million compared with the prior year. 24 Also included in the results for the year ended June 30, 2005 are corrections of errors that reduced gross profit by $7.9 million. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $623.0 million for the year, compared with $555.6 million in the prior year. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.5% this year, down slightly from 24.7% in the prior year. The Cinch acquisition added incremental selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $16.0 million as compared with the prior year. The currency translation impact further increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $16.9 million. Also, in connection with the resignation of its former auditor, responses to SEC comment inquiries, and internal investigations authorized by the Companys Audit Committee, the Company estimates that legal, accounting and other costs during fiscal 2005 increased by approximately $9.9 million. Research and development expenditures for the year increased $14.6 million to $133.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenue, compared with 5.3% of net revenue last year. Research and development expenditures in fiscal 2005 contributed to the release of approximately 384 new products during the year. In fiscal 2005, 30% of net revenue was derived from the sale of products released by the Company within the last three years. Molex continued its long term commitment to reinvesting its profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance the Companys competitive position. The Company was granted 775 new patents during the year, an increase of 36% over the prior year. Also included in the results for the year ended June 30, 2005 are corrections of errors that increased selling, general and administrative expense by $1.5 million. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Restructuring Costs Molex recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in order to reduce costs, better optimize plant utilization and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring includes facility closures that impact the Companys operations in the Americas and European regions. In the Americas region, the Company will close an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and cease manufacturing in its Detroit area automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in the Detroit area will continue in operation. Production from these facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, the Company will close certain manufacturing facilities in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia, and reduce the size of a development center in Germany. Production from these manufacturing facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. The Company estimates that it will reduce headcount by appro ximately 1,400 employees initially and then add back 800 employees at the facilities where production is being transferred, for a net reduction of 600 employees. The pre tax charge for the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter included cash expenditures of $3.8 million, which consisted primarily of severance and other employee related costs. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors including the Companys efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. Implementation of this restructuring program is expected to continue through fiscal 2006 for which the Company is anticipating an additional estimated pre tax charge of $15 million to $25 million during fiscal 2006. Approximately 60% of the additional charges are expected to impact the Americas region with the remainder impacting Europe. For additional information concerning the status of the Companys restructuring progr ams see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairments The Company also recorded a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million. During 2005, the Company completed its annual impairment review for goodwill. Indicators of impairment were found in the Molex Premise Network (MPN) reporting unit. The MPN business, consisting of products primarily sold into the structured cabling market for data communications had not performed as management had expected. Slower growth in MPNs markets served and slower than expected customer acceptance of its products in the structured cabling business, as well as a delay in the transition to next generation data communication networks, had a negative impact on MPNs operating results. These factors resulted in lower growth expectations for the reporting unit, which resulted in the goodwill impairment charge. For additional discussion on goodwill and the impairment charge, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the Company recorded a pre tax asset impairment charge of $2.3 million related to the expected sale of a U.S. based facility that was previously used for manufacturing and warehousing of fiber optic products that have now been consolidated into other facilities. Other Income Total other income was $19.5 million for fiscal 2005, compared with $18.7 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2004 results included a $10.4 million gain resulting from an IPO completed by an affiliate and the sale of stock of this affiliate, as well as a loss on investment of $5.0 million. Interest income, net of interest expense, was $6.4 million for fiscal 2005 compared with $3.7 million in the prior year period due to both higher cash balances held in the current year as well as higher interest rates. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.8% for fiscal 2005 compared with 26.5% in fiscal 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects the charge for the goodwill impairment the Company recognized in fiscal 2005 and an increase in the valuation allowance for losses incurred for which no tax benefit could be recorded. These items were offset to some extent by the favorable resolution of various tax matters with tax authorities as well as the correction of accruals for income tax exposures and other income tax adjustments (see Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company also reflected a tax benefit related to the recording of state deferred taxes in fiscal 2005. Net Income Net income for the year was $154.4 million, down 12.2% from $176.0 million reported in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 net income included after tax charges of $21.6 million for restructuring costs, $22.9 million for goodwill impairment and $1.4 million for other asset impairments. Foreign currency translation increased net income by approximately $4.1 million. Diluted earnings per share were $0.81 for fiscal 2005 compared with $0.92 for fiscal 2004. Comprehensive income includes all non stockholder changes in equity and consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The increase in comprehensive income for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the weaker U.S. dollar versus the yen and euro. Backlog The Companys order backlog on June 30, 2005 was approximately $259.5 million, a decline of $73.1 million compared with $332.6 million at June 30, 2004. The decrease in backlog was partially attributable to an increase in distribution bookings in June 2004 of approximately $36 million placed in advance of a price increase. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company provided vendor managed inventory programs to customers. Under this method, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. New orders for fiscal 2005 were $2,489.8 million, compared with $2,366.0 million last year. 26 Year Ended June 30, 2004 Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2003 Year Over Year Over Years Ended Year Year Results as % June 30, $ Change % Change of Net Revenue (in thousands) Favorable Favorable 2004 2003 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2004 2003 Net revenue $ 2,246,715 $ 1,843,098 $ 403,617 21.9 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 1,469,969 1,235,398 (234,571 ) (19.0 ) 65.4 67.0 Gross profit 776,746 607,700 169,046 27.8 34.6 33.0 Selling, general & administrative 555,563 470,415 (85,148 ) (18.1 ) 24.7 25.5 Restructuring costs 35,027 35,027 100.0 2.0 Income from operations 221,183 102,258 118,925 116.3 9.9 5.5 Other (income) expense, net (18,709 ) (7,784 ) 10,925 140.4 0.8 0.5 Income before income taxes 239,892 110,042 129,850 118.0 10.7 6.0 Income taxes & minority interest 63,942 25,124 (38,818 ) (154.5 ) 2.9 1.4 Net income $ 175,950 $ 84,918 $ 91,032 107.2 % 7.8 % 4.6 % Revenue Revenue was $2.25 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, an increase of 21.9%, compared with $1.84 billion last year. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $89 million in fiscal 2004. The following table sets forth information on the Companys net revenue by geographic regions for the periods indicated: Year Over Year Over Years Ended Year Year Results as % June 30, $ Change % Change of Net Revenue (in thousands) Favorable Favorable 2004 2004 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2004 2003 Americas $ 686,129 $ 641,197 $ 44,932 7.0 % 30.5 % 34.8 % Far East North 499,348 407,821 91,527 22.4 22.2 22.1 Far East South 623,619 458,819 164,800 35.9 27.8 24.9 Europe 385,051 291,043 94,008 32.3 17.1 15.8 Corp. and Other 52,568 44,218 8,350 18.9 2.4 2.4 Total $ 2,246,715 $ 1,843,098 $ 403,617 21.9 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Americas Region North and South America Customer revenue was $686.1 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of 7% compared with fiscal 2003 revenue of $641.2 million, with the growth occurring during the second half of the fiscal year. The revenue growth in this region was due to a broad improvement across all markets led by a recovering economy and strong consumer confidence in the U.S. Far East North Japan and Korea Customer revenue grew 22.4% to $499.3 million in fiscal 2004 compared with revenue of $407.8 million in fiscal 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $33 million to this increase. Demand was especially strong for advanced digital home entertainment products such as digital still cameras, camcorders and flat screen and plasma TVs, as well as for high end mobile phones. Revenue also improved in the industrial market, especially for semiconductor inspection equipment and industrial automation. 27 Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Customer revenue for fiscal 2004 was $623.6 million, an increase of $164.8 million or 35.9%, compared with the prior year. The biggest drivers of this growth were American, European and Japanese companies moving production to China and strong demand in the consumer electronics, mobile phone, notebook and desktop computer markets. European Region In Europe, customer revenue in fiscal 2004 was $385.1 million, an increase of 32.3%, as compared with $291.0 million in fiscal 2003. During the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company purchased the assets and business of Cinch, which added revenues of $20.5 million during fiscal 2004. Foreign currency translation, led by the strong euro, also increased customer revenues by approximately $44.5 million. Gross Profit Gross profit was $776.7 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volumes. The realized savings from the prior years restructuring program also contributed to the improvement. Offsetting these improvements, the Company estimates that it paid approximately $10 million more in fiscal 2004 for metal strip and gold purchases. During fiscal 2004, the Company realized savings of approximately $16 million related to the fiscal 2003 restructuring actions of which approximately 75% is reflected in fiscal 2004 cost of sales. For additional information concerning the status of the Companys restructuring programs, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $555.6 million. Foreign currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $23 million. Research and development expenditures were $119.0 million, or 5.3% of net revenue, during fiscal 2004, compared with $117.0 million, or 6.3% of net revenue, in the prior year. During fiscal 2004, the Company adopted a more narrow definition of research and development. This change had the effect of reducing reported research and development spending in fiscal 2004 by approximately $18 million compared with the prior year. Research and development expenditures in fiscal 2004 contributed to the release of 415 new products during the year. In fiscal 2004, 25.1% of net revenue was derived from the sale of products released by the Company within the last three years. Molex continued its long term commitment to reinvesting its profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance the Companys competitive position. The Company was granted 568 new patents during the year. Other Income Other (income) expense for fiscal 2004 included a pre tax gain of $10.4 million from the sale of stock of an affiliate and an equity gain resulting from an IPO completed by the affiliate. Molex retains a 20% ownership in this affiliate. In addition, the Company recorded a pre tax charge of $5.0 million to exit other investments in start up technologies. Interest income, net of interest expense of $2.2 million, was $3.7 million for fiscal 2004 compared with $8.2 million, net of interest expense of $2.9 million, in the prior year period. The prior year included an interest benefit of approximately $3.0 million from the favorable closure of tax audits in several U.S. jurisdictions. 28 Effective Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 26.5% for fiscal 2004 compared with 22.5% in fiscal 2003. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily the result of an increase in the Companys pre tax earnings from higher rate jurisdictions. Net Income Net income rose to $176.0 million during fiscal 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed $4.7 million to net income. Fiscal 2003 net income included an after tax charge of $28.6 million for restructuring costs and the write down of certain investments. Diluted earnings per share was $0.92 for fiscal 2004 compared with $0.44 for fiscal 2003. Comprehensive income includes all non stockholder changes in equity and consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The increase in comprehensive income for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to net income and favorable foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the weaker U.S. dollar versus the yen and euro. Financial Condition and Liquidity Molexs financial position remains strong and the Company continues to be able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $497.6 million and $338.7 million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys long term financing strategy is to rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Management believes that the Companys liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current and future growth. Molex has historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists. Long term debt and obligations under capital leases at June 30, 2005 totaled $10.0 million. The Company has available lines of credit totaling $122.0 million at June 30, 2005. Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided from operating activities $ 430,835 $ 292,031 $ 304,872 Cash used for investing activities (286,232 ) (158,358 ) (249,225 ) Cash used for financing activities (75,689 ) (86,108 ) (92,331 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 6,411 7,890 2,183 Net increase (decrease) in cash $ 75,325 $ 55,455 $ (34,501 ) Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities increased by $138.8 million from fiscal 2004 due mainly to steady working capital levels and higher cash earnings when compared with the prior year. Although customer revenue was higher during fiscal 2005, accounts receivable balances increased moderately. The Company also increased inventory levels in fiscal 2005 to support the higher volume, although this increase was partially offset by higher accounts payable balances. Working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities, at June 30, 2005 was $904.6 million compared with $740.2 million at June 30, 2004. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities increased by $127.9 million primarily due to higher capital expenditures and an increase in the level of investment in marketable securities during fiscal 2005. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company sold its investment in an affiliate and generated cash from this transaction of $14.1 million. 29 Financing Activities Cash was used primarily for the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury stock. The Company purchased 2,395,000 shares of Common and Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2005 at an aggregate cost of $58.2 million and 2,740,000 shares during fiscal 2004 at an aggregate cost of $70.2 million. The Companys Board of Directors previously authorized the discretionary purchase of up to $100.0 million of Common Stock and or Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2005. On April 25, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors replaced this $100 million authorization with a new authorization of a discretionary purchase program that expires December 31, 2006 and increased the aggregate value of any future purchases to $250 million. Molex has a strong cash balance and cash flow and very little debt. The Company believes at this time that share repurchases are a good investment as compared with investing its cash in short term money instruments or marketable securities, particularly with the current low interest rates. The Company also uses shares repurchased to replenish stock used for exercises of employee stock options, employee stock awards and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As part of its growth strategy, the Company may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions the Company completes may impact its cash requirements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes Molexs significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2005, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than (in thousands) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 24,232 $ 9,650 $ 6,523 $ 2,928 $ 5,131 Capital lease obligations 5,452 2,971 2,391 90 Other long term liabilities 9,920 156 1,812 546 7,406 Purchase obligations 2,350 2,350 Debt obligations 11,079 3,036 2,087 5,368 588 Total (1) $ 53,033 $ 15,813 $ 15,163 $ 8,932 $ 13,125 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Molex and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Molexs purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. With the exception of one purchase obligation for raw materials included in the table above, the Company does not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. 30 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (a) made guarantees, (b) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (c) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (d) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. Molex does not have exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of certain operating leases. See Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Companys lease arrangements. The Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the information incorporated by reference herein and the exhibits hereto, may include forward looking statements. Forward looking statements broadly involve the Companys current expectations or forecasts of future results. The Companys forward looking statements generally relate to growth strategies, industry trends, financial results, cost reduction initiatives, manufacturing strategies, product development, regulatory approvals, competitive strengths, the scope of Molexs Intellectual property rights, and sales efforts. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, possible, project, should, will and similar words or expressions. Any statements that are not historical facts, including estimates, projections, future trends and the outcome of events that have not yet occurred, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, but investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by the Company on this subject in its filings with the Commission, especially on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K in which Molex discusses in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. The Company intends to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding forward looking statements, and is including this sentence for the express purpose of enabling it to use the protections of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements. Risk Factors It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that may affect the Companys prospects or forward looking statements and any list of such factors cannot be an exhaustive list of all risks, uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions affecting such prospects or forward looking statements. Consider carefully these factors as well as any factors discussed with specific forward looking statements in this annual report and in the Companys other filings with the Commission. In some cases, these factors have affected, and in the future (together with other unknown factors) may affect, the Companys ability to implement its business strategy and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate or projection contained in a forward looking statement can be achieved. The Companys ability to achieve results consistent with its current expectations or otherwise depends significantly on certain factors that may cause actual future results to differ materially from expectations. Risk factors that could influence the Companys prospects, performance and financial condition generally include a number of factors that might be within or outside the influence of management. Factors that could affect the Companys performance and condition include the following: 31 Competitive Factors: pricing pressures, both in the U.S. and abroad; development of new products by existing and future competitors having superior performance compared to the Companys existing and future products; technological advances, patents, and registrations obtained by existing and future competitors, which could make the Companys existing products or products under development obsolete, unmarketable or uncompetitive; existing and future competitors may have more engineering, manufacturing, marketing, financial and personnel resources available to them, may have better access to such resources, may be better able to attract and retain highly qualified personnel resources, and may have lower manufacturing costs. The Company can give no assurances that it will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors and such competitive factors could lead to price cuts, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. Available Market Opportunities: the timing, size, and nature of strategic initiatives, market opportunities, and research and technology platforms available to the Company; the Company may be unsuccessful in identifying and consummating acquisitions and other business development initiatives, which could impede its growth and ability to remain competitive. Industry Consolidation: the trend of consolidation in the connector industry as well as among customers, resulting in more significant, complex, and long term contracts than in the past, and potentially greater pricing pressures and the possible strengthening of competitors through industry consolidation. Industry Changes: the electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological advancement, requiring the Company to have the ability to anticipate and react effectively to the changing electronics environment, including the enhancement of existing products and the successful development and introduction of new products that are accepted in markets in which the Company operates. However, the Company will not be able to predict with certainty technological trends or new products in the market and will not be able to predict whether its products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable, and therefore, the Company may not be able to compete successfully. Cyclical Industry and Demand of Customers: cyclical patterns of the connector industry and customer industries; decline or lack of growth of customers industries, customer demand of Molexs products, and the capital investment patterns and financial capabilities of customers could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. Manufacturing and Distribution Challenges: achievement of manufacturing efficiencies and quality objectives, including gross margin benefits from manufacturing process and supply chain programs; efficiently and consistently manufacturing quality products; successfully managing the relationships with suppliers and distributors; and effectively managing inventory mix and inventory levels. Cost and Availability of Raw Materials and Supplies: volatility in the prices of plastic resins, copper based metal alloys, gold and palladium salts, molded and stamped components, and connector assemblies could increase the costs of the Companys products reducing gross margins or demand for its products. Restructuring Implementation: ability to successfully transition manufacturing operations to low labor cost locations in response to industry changes and successfully complete the plant restructuring actions, including the transition of production to Molexs other facilities; the Companys ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts and to generate the level of cost savings expected and or that are necessary to effectively compete. Acquisition Integration: efficient integration of acquired businesses and achieved planned cost synergies and profit expectations, difficulties that could disrupt the Companys ongoing business, distract management and the workforce, increase the Companys expenses and adversely affect operating results. Product Development: maintain research and development expenditures, successfully forecast long term market trends and successfully complete prototypes to develop and obtain customer approval for products on a timely basis. Such development expenditures often must be made before knowing whether the resulting new products will meet with market acceptance or result in revenue and the Company may focus resources on technologies that do not become widely accepted and are not commercially viable. In addition, new products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment. 32 Demand for Employees: competition for key personnel in various of the Companys product and geographic markets is intense and future success depends in large part on the continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain key employees, including qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to compete and develop successful new products. The Company may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting, assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel. Intellectual Property and Contract Rights: the failure or inability to obtain, limitations on the use of, or the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights; enforcing contract rights and or unauthorized third party use of the Companys intellectual property rights, technologies and products, which in foreign countries may be difficult to police where the laws may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or other countries. Financial Management: management of financial assets, including having adequate internal controls and effective cash management and leveraging various tax planning opportunities to achieve the expected effective tax rate. Additional Impairment Charges: pursuant to GAAP, periodically assessing goodwill, intangibles and other long lived assets to determine if they are impaired; disruptions to the Companys or customers business, protracted economic weakness and unexpected significant declines in operating results, which may result in additional charges to goodwill and other asset impairment, possibly reducing operating results, net worth and stockholders equity. Government Action: the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as manufacturing and labeling, safety requirements, recall of products, new laws and judicial decisions related to the marketing and distribution of products, the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities, the impact of regulatory reviews for state, local and international tax, customs and export controls and changes in the tax and environmental laws affecting the Companys business. Legal Disputes: intellectual property rights claims, product liability claims, claims asserting securities law violations, employee claims, derivative stockholder actions, claims asserting antitrust violations, and environmental matters, as well as the significant expenses incurred in defending such claims and the damages that may be collected by plaintiffs pursuant to any such successful claims. Customers and Suppliers: unforeseen interruptions with the Companys largest customers, suppliers and distributors resulting from, but not limited to strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions or inventory excesses; the Companys ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity. General Economic Conditions: international and domestic business conditions including the relationships between the U.S., Chinese and other governments; unexpected changes in the laws or regulations or trade, monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S., China or other foreign countries; raw material shortages and price increases; political instability in foreign countries; the market value of investments in other companies. Other Factors: natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, or floods, or other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, or failures of the Companys management information or other systems. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. The Company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets it serves. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which the Company operates, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. 33 Molex also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2005 and 2004. The Company has implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, the Company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable/payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of the Companys international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $72.1 million and increased income from operations of $6.4 million for 2005, compared with the estimated results for 2005 using the average rates for 2004. The Companys $187.8 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2005 are principally debt instruments that generate interest income for the Company on temporary excess cash balances. These instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling the Company to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date. The Companys exposure related to derivative instrument transactions is, in the aggregate, not material to Molexs financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest rate exposure is limited to marketable securities owned by the Company and long term debt. The Company does not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of its investments (less than 12 months) and the fixed rate nature of its long term debt. Due to the nature of its operations, Molex is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. The Company monitors the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it operates. Molex has implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during its manufacturing process and believes it continues to meet or exceed local government regulations. 34
