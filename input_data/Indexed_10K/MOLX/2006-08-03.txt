Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electromechanical components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, data, consumer products, automotive and industrial markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and plasma televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. We believe that our sales mix is balanced, with growth prospects in a number of markets. Net revenues by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce. The approximate percentage of net revenue by market for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 is outlined below. % of Net Revenue 2006 2005 2004 Telecommunications 30 % 27 % 23 % Data Products 22 24 26 Automotive 18 19 17 Consumer 19 18 21 Industrial 9 9 10 Other 2 3 3 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their subcontractors and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors throughout the world. Our engineers work collaboratively with customers to develop products that meet their specific needs. Our connector products are designed to help manufacturers assemble their own products more efficiently. Our electronic components help enable manufacturers to break down their production into sub assemblies that can be built on different production lines, in different factories or by subcontractors. Our connectors allow these sub assemblies to be readily plugged together before selling the end product to a customer. Our connectors also enable users to connect together related electronic items, such as mobile phones to battery chargers and computers to printers. Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. We service our customers through our global manufacturing footprint. As of June 30, 2006, we operated 54 manufacturing plants, located in 18 countries on five continents. Manufacturing in many sectors has continued to move from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced the need for duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, our strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world. As announced in April 2005, we realigned part of our manufacturing capacity that resulted in the closing of seven plants in five countries. We operate our business in four geograph ic regions. In 2006, 52% of our revenue was derived from sales in Asia. Economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, is anticipated to be greater than in the Americas and Europe. Our management believes that it has positioned the business to benefit from this trend. Approximately 50% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. 21 The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are the worlds second largest manufacturer of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2006 of $2.86 billion increased 12.3% over fiscal 2005 net revenue of $2.55 billion. Net revenue in local currencies increased 13.5%. Net income for the year of $237.0 million increased $82.6 million from $154.4 million reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2006 includes restructuring costs of $26.4 million ($19.2 million after tax). Fiscal 2005 net income included a restructuring charge of $27.9 million ($21.6 million after tax), a goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million ($22.9 million after tax) and an asset impairment charge of $2.3 million ($1.4 million after tax). As announced on April 25, 2005, we realigned part of our manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize plant utilization and to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. We recorded a pre tax charge of $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and recorded an additional pre tax charge of $26.4 million during fiscal 2006 in connection with this plan. Cash expenditures through June 30, 2006 in connection with the restructuring were $17.8 million, consisting primarily of severance and other employee related costs. Implementation of this restructuring program began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and continued throughout fiscal 2006. We believe that the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of June 30, 2006. The fiscal 2006 results include the effect of expensing stock options according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Selling, general and administrative expense was $13.7 million higher in fiscal 2006 as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). On June 30, 2006, we signed a definitive merger agreement with Woodhead Industries, Inc. (Woodhead) pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Woodhead in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $256.0 million, including payments with respect to outstanding stock options and the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. The Boards of Directors of both companies approved the transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we commenced on July 10, 2006, a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Woodhead stock at a price of $19.25 per share in cash. We plan to acquire shares not purchased pursuant to the tender offer, other than dissenting shares, in a subsequent merger at a price of $19.25 per share in cash as soon as practicable after completion of the tender offer. Completion of the tender offer is currently anticipated during the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2006, and is subject to certain conditions, including the tender by Woodhead stockholders of a majority of Woodheads common shares on a fully diluted basis, receipt of regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. There is no guarantee that we will acquire sufficient Woodhead shares to complete the acquisition. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates communicated below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. 22 Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $148.3 million at June 30, 2006. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although our management believes our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. A valuation allowance of $5.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2006 to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of $5.2 million related to certain European net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $33.9 million at June 30, 2006. It is our policy to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We establish the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. At June 30, 2006, we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable contingencies. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or would be required to pay amounts in excess of accruals, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. 23 Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the benefit obligation, are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. We have typically used the market rate for AA/Aa rated corporate bonds for this assumption. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2006, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (3,406) $ (7,613) $ (337) $ (414) Decrease 50 basis points 3,698 8,639 348 95 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A $ (381) $ (357) Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A 381 357 Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. A 100 basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Effect on total service and interest cost: Increase 100 basis points $ 1,476 $ 1,073 $ 714 Decrease 100 basis points (1,211) (908) (600) Effect on APBO: Increase 100 basis points $ 9,951 $ 8,655 $ 6,277 Decrease 100 basis points (8,164) (7,325) (5,279) Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31st, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. 24 The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized over a number of accounting periods. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of e stimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. As of June 30, 2006, we had substantially completed the restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends.

We estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $79.0 million compared with the prior year. We sell our products in five primary markets.

We believe that new products are essential to enable our customers to advance their solutions and their market leadership positions. Additionally, we believe that new 26 products tend to have a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue, but may be subject to higher price erosion as unit volumes grow, production experience is accumulated and costs decrease. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows for the fiscal years ended June 30: &lt;del&gt; 2006 2005 Americas 25 % 22 % Far East North 23 35 Far East South 33 36 Europe 27 27 Total 28 30 Americas Region North and South America Revenue in the Americas region increased from the prior year period primarily due to stronger demand and new product offerings for electronic connector products, particularly in high performance applications. We experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year period partially because in 2006 the seasonally slow third fiscal quarter was instead relatively consistent with volumes in the second fiscal quarter. While we believe that year to date sales growth in the Americas region was negatively affected by the movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers, we experienced a reduction in this trend during the second half of fiscal 2006. However, we believe that this trend positively contributed to year to date sales in other regions of our business, especially in the Far East South region. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Revenue in local currencies was higher during fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily due to stronger demand in the consumer and telecom markets. Demand in these markets increased steadily during fiscal 2006 and was stronger during the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year even though the second half of the year is generally seasonally lower for the telecommunications and consumer markets. The region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact, high performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as video and camera functionality. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our 3G technology business as global cell phone makers adopt this technology. During fiscal 2006, the region operated at a high capacity level with significant resources allocated to support increased demand in the Far East South region. Revenue between regions is generally recognized as intercompany revenue, which is excluded from the revenue by region table, above. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased during fiscal 2006 from the prior year. As a result, this region is our largest and fastest growing in terms of revenue. The revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by strong demand in the mobile phone and consumer products markets. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of 2006 as compared with the same period in the prior year primarily because the inventory correction and reduction in demand that occurred in the third fiscal quarter of 2005 did not recur in fiscal 2006. Our sales in China increased by 29.5% during fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period, due to customer demand supported by increased production capacity. The drivers of this growth included (i) overall higher demand in the mobile phone, consumer electronics and automotive markets, (ii) the trend of American, European and Japanese companies moving their design and production to China and (iii) greater penetration of Taiwanese multinational accounts. 27 European Region For fiscal 2006, revenue as compared with the prior year increased primarily due to a slight recovery in demand for general connector products, increased sales of integrated products and additional penetration in the automotive market in which we participate. However, the overall trend toward movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers continued and we believe that this trend contributed to sales in other regions of our business, especially in the Far East South region. Customer revenue in the European region began improving during the third fiscal quarter and increased during the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year period. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to remain in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Gross Profit Gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in net revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2006, as compared with the prior year period, was higher primarily due to operating efficiencies gained in the Far East South and focus on higher margin products in the Americas. Gross profit for fiscal 2005 included the impact of corrections of errors that reduced gross profit by $8.0 million. See Note 3 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We estimate that we paid approximately $42.1 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period. These increases, along with the impact of price erosion, were partially offset by (i) an improved sales mix and product pruning, (ii) selective price increases that became effective during the second fiscal quarter of 2006, (iii) improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and (iv) favorable changes in currency exchange rates. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result of a stronger U.S. dollar compared with the yen during the period, exchange rates reduced our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. We estimate that the impact from currency transactions increased gross profit by approximately $35.5 million for fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year, but increased at a rate substantially lower than the rate of revenue growth. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to support the higher levels of business and the additional compensation expense for stock options as described in the following paragraph was offset by cost reductions due to the restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and other cost containment measures, especially in the European Region. Effective in fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) which resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $13.7 million for fiscal 2006. Total share based compensation recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $29.2 million for fiscal 2006, of which $28.2 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and $1.0 million is included in restructuring costs. In fiscal 2005, we recognized $14.9 million of share based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. (See Note 19 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). The impact of currency translation decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $11.8 million for fiscal 2006. 28 Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, increased to $140.9 million, or 4.9% of net revenue, for fiscal 2006, compared with 5.2% of net revenue last year. Restructuring Costs We recorded a pre tax charge of $26.4 million during fiscal 2006 and $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in connection with our restructuring to reduce costs, better optimize plant utilization and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring included facility closures that impacted our operations in the Americas and European regions. We reduced headcount by approximately 500 people after additions at the facilities where production was transferred. In the Americas region, we closed an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and ceased manufacturing in our Detroit area automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in the Detroit area will continue in operation. Production from these facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, we closed manufacturing facilities in Portugal and Ireland and reduced the size of a development center in Germany since announcing the restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We also closed a manufacturing facility in Slovakia. Production from these manufacturing facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2006 compared with 28.8% for fiscal 2005. The overall decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects higher fiscal 2006 earnings in countries with tax rates that are lower than the U.S. rate offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for losses incurred for which no tax benefit could be recorded. Fiscal 2005 reflects a charge for goodwill impairment and an increase in the valuation allowance. Backlog Our order backlog on June 30, 2006 was approximately $370.0 million, an increase of $110.5 million compared with $259.5 million at June 30, 2005. New orders for fiscal 2006 were $2,951.1 million, an increase of 18.5% compared with $2,489.8 million last year. 29 Year Ended June 30, 2005 Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2004 Year Ended $ Change % Change Result as % June 30, Favorable Favorable of Net Revenue (in thousands) 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2005 2004 Net revenue $ 2,548,652 $ 2,246,715 $ 301,937 13.4 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 1,675,308 1,469,969 (205,339) (14.0) 65.7 65.4 Gross profit 873,344 776,746 96,598 12.4 34.3 34.6 Selling, general & administrative 622,954 555,563 (67,391) (12.1) 24.5 24.7 Restructuring costs 27,875 (27,875) (100.0) 1.1 Goodwill and asset impairments 25,169 (25,169) (100.0) 1.0 Income from operations 197,346 221,183 (23,837) (10.8) 7.7 9.9 Other income, net 19,541 18,709 832 4.4 0.8 0.8 Income before income taxes 216,887 239,892 (23,005) (9.6) 8.5 10.7 Income taxes & minority interest 62,453 63,942 1,489 2.3 2.4 2.9 Net income $ 154,434 $ 175,950 $ (21,516) (12.2) % 6.1 % 7.8 % Net revenue The acquisition of French based Connecteurs Cinch S.A. and its subsidiaries (Cinch) completed in April, 2004, added $30.2 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2005. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and the yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $72.1 million over the prior year period. We estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $88 million for fiscal 2005, compared with the prior year. The balance of the revenue increase came primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products, and sales of new products. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months was $764 million, or 30% of total revenue, in the current year, compared with $563 million, or 25% of revenue, fo r the prior year. A summary follows of the estimated change in revenue from each market during the fiscal years ended June 30: &lt;del&gt; 2005 2004 Telecommunications 33 % 34 % Data Products 5 17 Automotive 27 9 Consumer (3) 22 Industrial 2 35 The following table sets forth information on our net revenue by geographic regions for the periods indicated (in thousands): &lt;del&gt; Year Ended $ Change % Change Result as % June 30, Favorable Favorable of Net Revenue 2005 2004 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2005 2004 Americas $ 701,470 $ 686,129 $ 15,341 2.2 % 27.5 % 30.5 % Far East North 523,717 499,348 24,369 4.9 20.5 22.2 Far East South 769,218 623,619 145,599 23.3 30.2 27.8 Europe 504,453 385,051 119,402 31.0 19.8 17.1 Corporate and other 49,794 52,568 (2,774) (5.3) 2.0 2.4 Total $ 2,548,652 $ 2,246,715 $ 301,937 13.4 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 30 The weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, principally the yen and euro, increased revenue by approximately $72.1 million for fiscal 2005 over the prior year. The following table shows the effect on the change in net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar (in thousands): Year Ended June 30, 2005 Local Currency Net Currency Translation Change Americas $ 13,011 $ 2,330 $ 15,341 Far East North 87 24,282 24,369 Far East South 137,501 8,098 145,599 Europe 84,851 34,551 119,402 Corporate and other (5,656) 2,882 (2,774) Net change $ 229,794 $ 72,143 $ 301,937 The change in revenue on a local currency basis is as follows: &lt;del&gt; Year Ended Jun.30, 2005 Americas 1.9 % Far East North Far East South 22.0 Europe 22.0 Total 10.2 We continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows for fiscal years ended June 30: 2005 2004 Americas 22 % 18 % Far East North 35 33 Far East South 36 28 Europe 27 24 Total 30 25 Americas Region North and South America Customer revenue in the Americas region for fiscal 2005 increased 2.2% from the prior year, due to a slightly stronger demand for electronic connector products, particularly in high performance products, including cable assemblies for the high end server market in supercomputer applications. We have also seen some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Modest sales growth reflects the accelerated movement offshore of OEMs and contract manufacturers. Although management believes that most of the related revenue remained within Molex, it contributed to sales in other regions and reduced the Americas results. The revenue loss was partially offset with an increase in distribution sales, industrial sales and new product sales. Integrated product sales grew at a faster rate than connector products, with the most significant increase from high performance cables and fiber optics products for computer and industrial market applications, as well as for the telecommunications market, which has finally stabilized. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Customer revenue in the Far East North region in fiscal 2005 increased 4.9% from the prior year in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $24 million to the revenue increase. A 31 robust business environment in Japan, a recovering economy in Korea and a steady flow of new products stimulated sales. The most significant growth in fiscal 2005 for Japan came from advanced digital home entertainment products such as digital still cameras and portable audio players and from consumer electronics products such as game machines and plasma display panels for flat screen TVs. Growth also came from hard disk drives and printers for the computer market. During the year, the region further capitalized on its ability to design more compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as TV and camera functionality. As more global phone makers move to 3G technology, we believe the region is well positioned to grow. Revenue to the industrial market increased, largely due to servo motor demand and customer investment in new semiconductor equipment. Automotive design wins in Japan were offset by decreased demand from Korean automakers due to Koreas sluggish economy. In Korea, modest strength in the electronics industry and the overall connector market was offset by reduced sales of personal computers. Revenue from integrated products grew at a faster rate than connector products in fiscal 2005. To counter pricing pressure, most integrated products are manufactured in our plant in Dalian, China, which underwent a 60% capacity expansion in fiscal 2005. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased 23.3% in fiscal 2005 in U.S. dollars, compared with the prior year. This region is now our largest and fastest growing segment. The revenue growth in this region was driven by strong demand across the consumer products and computer markets, as well as the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market. Our sales in China increased by 23% as a result of customer demand supported by increased production capacity. The biggest drivers of this growth were American, European and Japanese companies moving their design and production to China and greater penetration of Taiwanese multinational accounts. We experienced strong demand in the mobile phone, notebook and desktop computer, consumer electronics and automotive markets. Products used in mobile phones constitute nearly one third of Far East South sales. Consumer electronics is another important market for the region. During the year, new products were introduced to keep pace with the ongoing migration from analog to digital technology. The region is coordinating opportunities with our Molex counterparts in Japan to have these products designed in the Far East North and produced in China. In the data, networking and computing arena, we shifted our focus from telecommunications infrastructure equipment to the far stronger server market. The region also grew in its traditional niche of personal computers and notebooks. The automotive business in the Far East South region, although still in its early stages, is accelerating. Our product pipeline grew to five times the 2004 level. The Big 3 (Daimler Chrysler, Ford and General Motors) and their suppliers moving to China want local design, procurement and production, which the region can provide. We plan to open a new plant in summer 2007 in Chengdu, considered the Detroit of China. The new plant is expected to be our largest worldwide and manufacture products for the automotive industry and for other industries as well. To offer customers a complete solution, the region maintains a balance between high precision, high technology manufacturing in Singapore and commoditized capability in China. 32 European Region Customer revenue in Europe for fiscal 2005 increased 31.0% from the prior year in U.S. dollars. Our Cinch automotive acquisition, which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, accounted for $30.2 million of the $119.4 million in growth. The remaining revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by demand for mobile phones in the telecommunications market and products in the industrial market. The European connector market has been growing, albeit at a single digit pace. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to stay in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Integrated products now account for approximately 25% of the regions revenue. During the year, the region won projects from customers engaged in land and marine based oil exploration, as well as manufacturers requiring our products for industrial controls, testing equipment and power management. The region also increased its business with Nokia, the only major mobile phone company still producing in Europe. Management believes that the trend for European automakers, at least for the next five years, will be locally based and will rely on local distribution. We believe the region is in a good position to fulfill this need with a broad connector product offering and a robust new product pipeline. Key initiatives in the region include improving capacity utilization, shifting more manufacturing to the regions Eastern European locations, and using Six Sigma methodology to eliminate waste and enhance quality. Additionally, we are ahead of schedule with introducing lead free products and expect that we will deliver well in advance of the European compliance deadline. Gross Profit We were not able to fully offset the negative impact of price erosion discussed earlier with the leverage on the higher sales volume. The gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs. We estimate that we paid approximately $17 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in the current year compared with the same period last year. Although we implemented offsetting price increases to our distribution sales channel, we have not been as successful with the majority of our business. Our client mix skews toward large global customers and industries that make raising prices more difficult. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. The gross profit margin was negatively impacted as the yen and e uro strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. We estimate this currency transaction impact to be approximately $6.5 million compared with the prior year. Also included in the results for fiscal 2005 are corrections of errors that reduced gross profit by $8.0 million. See Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The Cinch acquisition added incremental selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $16.0 million as compared with the prior year. The currency translation impact further increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $16.9 million. Also, in connection with the resignation of our former auditor, responses to SEC comment inquiries, and internal investigations authorized by our Audit Committee, we estimate that legal, accounting and other costs during fiscal 2005 increased by approximately $9.9 million. Research and development expenditures for the year increased $14.6 million to $133.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenue, compared with 5.3% of net revenue last year. Research and development expenditures in fiscal 2005 contributed to the release of approximately 384 new products during the year. In fiscal 2005, 30% of net revenue was derived from the sale of products we released within the last three years. We continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position. We were granted 775 new patents during the year, an increase of 36% over the prior year. 33 Also included in the results for fiscal 2005 are corrections of errors that increased selling, general and administrative expense by $1.5 million. See Note 21 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Restructuring Costs We recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $27.9 million in fiscal 2005. We did not have material restructuring activity during fiscal 2004. Goodwill and Other Asset Impairments We also recorded a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million, during fiscal 2005. We did not record any material impairments during fiscal year 2004. Other Income Total other income was $19.5 million for fiscal 2005, compared with $18.7 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2004 results included a $10.4 million gain resulting from an IPO completed by an affiliate and the sale of stock of this affiliate, as well as a loss on investment of $5.0 million. Interest income, net of interest expense, was $6.4 million for fiscal 2005 compared with $3.7 million in the prior year period due to both higher cash balances held in the current year as well as higher interest rates. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.8% for fiscal 2005 compared with 26.5% in fiscal 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects the charge for the goodwill impairment we recognized in fiscal 2005 and an increase in the valuation allowance for net operating losses in foreign countries for which no tax benefit was recognized. These items were offset to some extent by the favorable resolution of various tax matters with tax authorities as well as the correction of accruals for income tax exposures and other income tax adjustments (see Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We also reflected a tax benefit related to the recording of state deferred taxes in fiscal 2005. Backlog Our order backlog on June 30, 2005 was approximately $259.5 million, a decline of $73.1 million compared with $332.6 million at June 30, 2004. The decrease in backlog was partially attributable to an increase in distribution bookings in June 2004 of approximately $36 million placed in advance of a price increase. In addition, during fiscal 2005 we provided vendor managed inventory programs to customers. Under this method, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. New orders for fiscal 2005 were $2,489.8 million, compared with $2,366.0 million last year. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position remains strong and we continue to be able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $485.5 million and $497.6 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we expect to utilize a portion of our existing cash to fund the acquisition of Woodhead. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Management believes that our liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current and future growth. We have historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists. Long term debt and obligations under capital leases at June 30, 2006 totaled $8.8 million. We ha ve available lines of credit totaling $123.0 million at June 30, 2006. 34 Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): &lt;del&gt; 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided from operating activities $ 443,081 $ 430,835 $ 292,031 Cash used for investing activities (240,779) (286,232) (158,358) Cash used for financing activities (189,039) (75,689) (86,108) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 9,796 6,411 7,890 Net increase in cash $ 23,059 $ 75,325 $ 55,455 Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities increased by $12.2 million for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2006 offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase was primarily due to the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year and reflects severance payments approximating $17.8 million in connection with the restructuring costs recorded in fiscal 2005. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Cash provided from operating activities increased by $138.8 million for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 due mainly to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2005 with steady working capital levels. Investing Activities Capital expenditures increased $45.9 million for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 in order to provide increased capability in the Far East North region and increased capability and capacity in the Americas and Far East South regions. Capital expenditures increased $41.1 million for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to investments in increasing capability in the Far East North region. During 2005, we also sold our investment in an affiliate and generated cash from this transaction of $14.1 million. Cash flow from investing activities also includes proceeds from marketable securities in the net amount of $37.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $67.0 million in fiscal 2004 and investments in marketable securities in the net amount of $83.5 million in fiscal 2005. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our uses of or investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities Cash was used primarily for the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury stock. We purchased shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock totaling 6.0 million shares, 2.4 million shares and 2.7 million shares during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The aggregate cost of these purchases was $165.3 million, $58.2 million and $70.2 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $250.0 million of common stock though December 31, 2006. Approximately $50.1 million was remaining under the authorization as of June 30, 2006. We have a strong cash balance and cash flow and a low level of debt. We believe at this time that share repurchases are a good investment as compared with investing our cash in short term money instruments or marketable securities, particularly with the current low interest rates. We also use shares repurchased to replenish stock used for exercises of employee stock options and employee stock awards. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may impact our cash and borrowing requirements. 35 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2006, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands). Less Than 13 35 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 24,061 $ 10,847 $ 6,562 $ 2,802 $ 3,850 Capital lease obligations 4,306 2,555 1,661 73 17 Other longterm liabilities 13,117 533 2,108 2,238 8,238 Debt obligations 8,061 968 2,193 4,732 168 Tota1 (1) $ 49,545 $ 14,903 $ 12,524 $ 9,845 $ 12,273 &lt;del&gt; (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (iv) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. 36 We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2006 and 2005. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in decreased net revenue of $30.8 million and decreased income from operations of $10.2 million for 2006, compared with the estimated results for 2006 using the average rates for 2005. Our $152.7 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2006 are principally debt instruments that generate interest income for us on temporary excess cash balances. These instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling us to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date. Our exposure related to derivative instrument transactions is, in the aggregate, not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest rate exposure is limited to our marketable securities and long term debt. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments (less than 12 months) and the fixed rate nature of our long term debt. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 37
