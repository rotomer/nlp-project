Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following information has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results, which is more fully described in the Managements Discussion and Analysis Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, below, and in Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K/A. Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements We are restating our consolidated financial statements to reflect evolving understanding of the views of the staff of the Commission relating to the qualitative aspects of past stock option misdating. In an August 2, 2006 press release (the Press Release), we announced that, following the widespread publicity regarding the granting of stock options, we undertook in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 a voluntary internal review of our past practices related to grants of stock options. As a result of our preliminary review, our Board of Directors (the Board) formed a Special Committee of independent directors in June 2006 to commence an investigation of our stock option granting practices for the period 1995 through 2006. The Special Committee retained independent legal counsel to aid in the investigation. The Special Committee and its independent counsel, assisted by forensic accountants, reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding annual stock option grants made to executive officers, employees and non employee directors, searched relevant physical and electronic documents and interviewed current directors, officers and employees. In the August Press Release we announced that both we and the Special Committee concluded that the dates of stock option and restricted stock grants to executive officers and other employees in a number of instances differed from the dates such grants were approved by the appropriate Board committee such that the price on the approval date was higher than the price on the stated grant date. The Special Committee concluded that no stock options granted to outside directors were misdated. The Special Committee concluded that our former General Counsel was responsible for the misdating and found that he failed to ensure compliance with the terms of our stock option plans and the required granting actions by preparing minutes that did not accurately reflect the deliberations and actions of the relevant Board committee, failing to document approvals of certain grants, and selecting grant dates to provide a favorable grant price to executive officers and employees. The General Counsel was removed from his position by the Board immediately following the completion of the Special Committees independent investigation and has recently retired as a result of other related events. We provided in the August Press Release the aggregate unrecorded non cash expense relating to misdated executive officer grants. We also stated that for grants to other employees (non executive officers) we and the Special Committee concluded that it was impracticable to determine the actual measurement dates of the grants, but that even if all such dates were determinable there would not be a material understatement of expense. The analysis of the grants to employees relied on in this determination included a range of potential measurement dates determined by reviewing the dates on documentation such as final spreadsheets listing the employees and the number of shares to be granted to such employees, e mails, and other correspondence. We announced in the August Press Release that our current executive officers agreed to repay their portion of the $685,000 in total gains realized by them as a result of the misdating and also agreed to increase the exercise prices of their unexercised options so that there would be no future gain due to misdating of grants, all of which has occurred. We also announced that we had voluntarily disclosed the misdated grants to the Commission. The facts and circumstances surrounding this issue continue to be the subject of inquiries by the Enforcement Division of the Commission and the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois. We continue to cooperate in both inquiries. Following our August Press Release, the Commissions Office of the Chief Accountant issued a letter on September 19, 2006 providing guidance regarding the proper accounting for various historical stock option granting practices. In light of this guidance, we undertook an effort to determine or estimate appropriate measurement dates of the misdated stock options granted to employees, other than executive officers, in order to calculate an understatement of expense relating to such options, rather than relying on a range of potential measurement dates for determining the understatement of expense. The effect of recognizing additional share based compensation expense resulting from the investigation of past stock grants to executive officers and employees is included below in this Explanatory Note. A detailed discussion of the financial effects of these matters is included in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to believe that the misdated grants did not result in a quantitatively material misstatement to our financial statements; however, due to evolving understanding of the views of the staff of the Commission relating to the qualitative aspects of this issue, we are making the restatement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to record the following: Non cash share based compensation expense for grants that were misdated; 26 Table of Contents Other adjustments unrelated to share based compensation pertaining to fiscal years prior to 2005 that, as previously disclosed, were not recorded in the originally filed financial statements due to their immateriality but which were corrected in fiscal year 2005; and Related tax effects for all items. This Form 10 K/A also includes the restatement of selected financial data as of and for the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, and the unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the years ended June 30, 2006, and 2005. We have not amended any of our other previously filed annual reports on Form 10 K or quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the periods affected by the restatement. For this reason, the consolidated financial statements and related financial information contained in previously filed reports should no longer be relied upon. Share Based Compensation The effect of recognizing additional share based compensation expense resulting from the misdated grants is as follows (in thousands): Pre Tax After Tax Expense Expense 1995 $ 47 $ 33 1996 119 82 1997 258 178 1998 418 288 1999 836 577 2000 1,986 1,370 2001 2,926 2,019 Total 1995 2001 effect 6,590 4,547 2002 3,920 2,705 2003 4,931 3,402 2004 4,456 3,075 2005 3,507 2,420 2006 1,330 918 Total 2002 2006 effect 18,144 12,520 Total effect $ 24,734 $ 17,067 Other Adjustments In addition, as disclosed in the Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, we corrected certain other errors during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, which were immaterial to the fiscal 2005 and prior years financial statements. In connection with the filing of this Form 10 K/A, we are also correcting these errors in the respective fiscal years. A description of these errors is as follows: Quarter ended September 30, 2004 As previously reported, included in the first fiscal quarter of 2005 was a charge of $9.1 million ($5.9 million after tax) for the cumulative effect of an error in prior years. This error related to the inadvertent omission of in transit intercompany inventory in our calculation of profit in inventory elimination. We recorded this profit in inventory adjustment as a reduction to inventories and a charge to cost of sales. Also included in the first fiscal quarter of 2005 results was a charge of $4.8 million ($3.1 million after tax) for the cumulative effect of an error in prior years related to our vacation accrual calculation. Also included was a charge for the correction of an error of the prior year bonus accrual of $0.5 million ($0.3 million after tax). In addition, included in the results of the first fiscal quarter of 2005 were (1) the correction of an error related to a prior year inventory allowance of $1.1 million ($0.7 million after tax), (2) the correction of an error of a prior year insurance accrual of $2.7 million ($1.8 million after tax), and (3) the cumulative effect of an error related to prior years receivable allowance of $3.2 million ($2.1 million after tax). These three items had a positive impact on income. 27 Table of Contents Quarter ended March 31, 2005 As previously reported, in the third fiscal quarter of 2005, gross profit was reduced by $2.0 million ($1.3 million after tax) to correct the timing of revenue recognition for certain customers where title passes on receipt of product. Also included in the third fiscal quarter of 2005 results was an adjustment to deferred income taxes for state taxes, which reduced 2005 income tax expense by $2.6 million. Quarter ended June 30, 2005 As previously reported, included in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 results were charges of $2.2 million ($1.4 million after tax) to correct errors of prior years pension expense outside the United States. Included in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 results were corrections of various prior years accruals and prepaid expenses, which increased 2005 pre tax income by $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax). Also included in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 results was a correction of a 2004 depreciation adjustment, which increased 2005 pre tax income by $0.6 million ($0.4 million after tax). In addition, included in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 results was a correction of prior years equity income, which reduced pre tax income by $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax). Also included in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 results were corrections of prior years accruals for potential income tax exposures and other income tax adjustments that reduced 2005 income tax expense by $5.7 million. Year ended June 30, 2005 As previously reported, the aggregate effect of the corrections of the above prior period errors recorded in fiscal 2005 reduced fiscal 2005 gross profit by $8.0 million and increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $1.4 million, and reduced equity income by $0.4 million, all resulting in a reduction in pre tax income of $9.8 million. Income tax expense was reduced by $11.7 million and net income was increased by $1.9 million ($0.01 per share). Of those cumulative amounts, pre tax and net income for fiscal 2004 should have been reduced by $3.3 million and $4.8 million ($0.02 per share) respectively; pre tax income for fiscal 2003 should have been reduced by $2.7 million and net income should have been increased by $2.5 million ($0.01 per share); pre tax and net income for fiscal 2002 should have been reduced by $1.5 million and $0.3 million (no effect on earnings per share), respectively and pre tax and net income for fiscal 2002 and prior years should have been reduced by $2.3 million and increased by $4.5 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the adjustments to income, reflecting in the proper fiscal years the corrections previously made in fiscal 2005 (in thousands): Increase (decrease) income Prior to 2005 2004 2003 2002 2002 Pre tax: Overstatement of profit in inventory $ 9,100 $ (3,200 ) $ (1,200 ) $ (400 ) $ (4,300 ) Overstatement of inventory reserve software logic (1,142 ) 1,142 Overstatement of accrued insurance (2,700 ) 2,200 500 Understatement of accrued vacation 4,824 (604 ) (1,590 ) (556 ) (2,074 ) Overstatement of reserve for doubtful accounts (3,169 ) (625 ) (710 ) (12 ) 4,516 Understatement of bonus accrual 500 (500 ) Overstatement of gross margin FOB destination 2,013 816 (1,183 ) 624 (2,270 ) Understatement of accrued pension 2,210 (693 ) 124 (435 ) (1,206 ) Adjustment to properly record equity investment 386 (43 ) 511 (854 ) Depreciation (642 ) 642 Other (1,569 ) 899 (849 ) (379 ) 1,898 Total pre tax $ 9,811 $ (3,308 ) $ (2,697 ) $ (1,512 ) $ (2,294 ) Tax effect of items above (3,434 ) 1,158 944 529 803 Income taxes adjustments (8,275 ) (2,629 ) 4,227 694 5,983 Net income $ (1,898 ) $ (4,779 ) $ 2,474 $ (289 ) $ 4,492 28 Table of Contents Change in Accounting Principle During the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we made a change in accounting principle to classify shipping and handling costs associated with the distribution of finished products to our customers as cost of sales (previously recorded in selling, general and administrative expense). We made the change in principle because we believe the classification of these shipping and handling costs in cost of sales better reflects the cost of producing and distributing our products and aligns our external financial reporting with the results we use internally to evaluate segment operating performance. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, prior period financial statements are restated to reflect the retroactive application of this change. The effects were as follows (in thousands): Increase (decrease) Selling, Cost General of sales Administrative Fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 $ 56,182 $ (56,182 ) 2005 48,644 (48,644 ) 2004 42,333 (42,333 ) 2003 34,506 (34,506 ) 2002 18,922 (18,922 ) Three months ended June 30, 2006 15,916 (15,916 ) March 31, 2006 13,737 (13,737 ) December 31, 2005 14,162 (14,162 ) September 30, 2005 12,367 (12,367 ) Three months ended June 30, 2005 12,594 (12,594 ) March 31, 2005 11,998 (11,998 ) December 31, 2004 12,220 (12,220 ) September 30, 2004 11,832 (11,832 ) Summary The following shows the share based compensation adjustments, the other adjustments, and the related tax effects of all adjustments for the fiscal years 2002 2006. The increase (decrease) in net income for each type of adjustment is as follows (in thousands): Net Non cash Income as Stock Other Other Net Previously Compensation Pre tax Tax Tax Total Income as Reported Expense Adjustments Effect Adjustments Adjustments Restated Year ended June 30, 2002 $ 76,479 $ (3,920 ) $ (1,512 ) $ 1,744 $ 694 $ (2,994 ) $ 73,485 2003 84,918 (4,931 ) (2,697 ) 2,473 4,227 (928 ) 83,990 2004 175,950 (4,456 ) (3,308 ) 2,539 (2,629 ) (7,854 ) 168,096 2005 154,434 (3,507 ) 9,811 (2,347 ) (8,275 ) (4,318 ) 150,116 2006 237,009 (1,330 ) 412 (918 ) 236,091 The restatement for the other adjustments did not have a cumulative effect on stockholders equity as of June 30, 2006 or 2005 because the errors were corrected during fiscal 2005. The cumulative effect on stockholders equity as of June 30, 2006 resulting from the restatement of share based compensation is as follows (in thousands): Increase (decrease) in retained earnings: Non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants $ (24,734 ) Related income tax benefit 7,667 Net reduction in retained earnings (17,067 ) Increase (decrease) in paid in capital: Increase related to non cash compensation expense 24,734 Reduction related to tax effects previously credited to additional paid in capital (6,488 ) Net increase in paid in capital 18,246 Net effect on stockholders equity $ 1,179 Overview Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electromechanical components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, data, consumer products, automotive and industrial markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and plasma televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. We believe that our sales mix is balanced, with growth prospects in a number of markets. Net revenues by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce. The approximate percentage of net revenue by market for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 is outlined below. 29 Table of Contents % of Net Revenue 2006 2005 2004 Telecommunications 30 % 27 % 23 % Data Products 22 24 26 Automotive 18 19 17 Consumer 19 18 21 Industrial 9 9 10 Other 2 3 3 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their subcontractors and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors throughout the world. Our engineers work collaboratively with customers to develop products that meet their specific needs. Our connector products are designed to help manufacturers assemble their own products more efficiently. Our electronic components help enable manufacturers to break down their production into sub assemblies that can be built on different production lines, in different factories or by subcontractors. Our connectors allow these sub assemblies to be readily plugged together before selling the end product to a customer. Our connectors also enable users to connect together related electronic items, such as mobile phones to battery chargers and computers to printers. Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. We service our customers through our global manufacturing footprint. As of June 30, 2006, we operated 54 manufacturing plants, located in 18 countries on five continents. Manufacturing in many sectors has continued to move from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced the need for duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, our strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world. As announced in April 2005, we realigned part of our manufacturing capacity that resulted in the closing of seven plants in five countries. We operate our business in four geographic regions. In 2006, 52% of our revenue was derived from sales in Asia. Economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, is anticipated to be greater than in the Americas and Europe. Our management believes that it has positioned the business to benefit from this trend. Approximately 50% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are the worlds second largest manufacturer of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2006 of $2.86 billion increased 12.0% over fiscal 2005 net revenue of $2.55 billion. Net revenue in local currencies increased 13.5%. Net income for the year of $236.1 million increased $86.0 million from $150.1 million reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2006 includes restructuring costs of $26.4 million ($19.2 million after tax). Fiscal 2005 net income included a restructuring charge of $27.9 million ($21.6 million after tax), a goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million ($22.9 million after tax) and an asset impairment charge of $2.3 million ($1.4 million after tax). As announced on April 25, 2005, we realigned part of our manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize plant utilization and to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. We recorded a pre tax charge of $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and recorded an additional pre tax charge of $26.4 million during fiscal 2006 in connection with this plan. Cash expenditures through June 30, 2006 in connection with the restructuring were $17.8 million, consisting primarily of severance and other employee related costs. Implementation of this restructuring program began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and continued throughout fiscal 2006. We believe that the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of June 30, 2006. The fiscal 2006 results include the effect of expensing stock options according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Selling, general and administrative expense was $13.3 million higher in fiscal 2006 as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). On June 30, 2006, we signed a definitive merger agreement with Woodhead Industries, Inc. (Woodhead) pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Woodhead in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $256.0 million, including payments with respect to outstanding stock options and the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. The Boards of Directors of both companies approved the transaction. 30 Table of Contents Under the terms of the merger agreement, we commenced on July 10, 2006, a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Woodhead stock at a price of $19.25 per share in cash. We plan to acquire shares not purchased pursuant to the tender offer, other than dissenting shares, in a subsequent merger at a price of $19.25 per share in cash as soon as practicable after completion of the tender offer. Completion of the tender offer is currently anticipated during the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2006, and is subject to certain conditions, including the tender by Woodhead stockholders of a majority of Woodheads common shares on a fully diluted basis, receipt of regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. There is no guarantee that we will acquire sufficient Woodhead shares to complete the acquisition. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates communicated below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Share based Compensation As discussed in the Explanatory Note, the previously stated dates of stock option and restricted stock grants to executive officers and other employees in a number of instances differed from the dates such grants were approved by the appropriate Board committee such that the price on the approval date was higher than the price on the stated grant date. In connection with our restatement of the consolidated Financial Statements, we applied judgment in determining or estimating appropriate measurement dates for prior option grants. We concluded that the most appropriate measurement date for stock option and restricted stock grants to executive officers that were misdated was the date of the Board committee meeting at which the grants were approved. We also concluded that the most appropriate measurement date for stock option grants to employees was the date on which the Board committee fixed the terms of the grants and approved the grants to specific employees. Due to a lack of documentation and process surrounding the employee stock option granting process, we estimated this date based on the date of grant documentation such as final spreadsheets listing the employees and the number of shares to be granted to such employees, e mails, and other correspondence. Since it appeared that the approval of these non officer employee grants could have occurred prior to the date of the grant documentation, we considered the impact that an earlier measurement date could have had on compensation expense. This sensitivity analysis resulted in no significant differences as compared with the amounts recorded in this restatement. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $149.5 million at June 30, 2006. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax 31 Table of Contents audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although our management believes our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. A valuation allowance of $5.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2006 to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of $5.2 million related to certain European net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $33.9 million at June 30, 2006. It is our policy to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We establish the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. At June 30, 2006, we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable contingencies. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or would be required to pay amounts in excess of accruals, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the benefit obligation, are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. We have typically used the market rate for AA/Aa rated corporate bonds for this assumption. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2006, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (3,406 ) $ (7,613 ) $ (337 ) $ (414 ) Decrease 50 basis points 3,698 8,639 348 95 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A $ (381 ) $ (357 ) Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A 381 357 32 Table of Contents Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. A 100 basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Effect on total service and interest cost: Increase 100 basis points $ 1,476 $ 1,073 $ 714 Decrease 100 basis points (1,211 ) (908 ) (600 ) Effect on APBO: Increase 100 basis points $ 9,951 $ 8,655 $ 6,277 Decrease 100 basis points (8,164 ) (7,325 ) (5,279 ) Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31st, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized over a number of accounting periods. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. As of June 30, 2006, we had substantially completed the restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended June 30, 2006 Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2005 Year Ended $ Change % Change Results as % June 30, Favorable Favorable of Net Revenue (in thousands) 2006 2005 (Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) 2006 2005 Net revenue $ 2,861,289 $ 2,554,458 $ 306,831 12.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 1,918,659 1,721,796 (196,863 ) (11.4 ) 67.1 67.4 Gross profit 942,630 832,662 109,968 13.2 32.9 32.6 Selling, general administrative 606,532 576,354 (30,178 ) (5.2 ) 21.2 22.6 Restructuring costs 26,354 27,875 1,521 5.5 0.9 1.1 Goodwill and asset impairments 25,169 25,169 100.0 1.0 Income from operations 309,744 203,264 106,480 52.4 10.8 7.9 Other income, net 18,229 19,927 (1,698 ) (8.5 ) 0.7 0.8 Income before income taxes 327,973 223,191 104,782 46.9 11.5 8.7 Income taxes minority interest 91,882 73,075 (18,807 ) (25.7 ) 3.2 2.8 Net income $ 236,091 $ 150,116 $ 85,975 57.3 % 8.3 % 5.9 % Net Revenue The increase in revenue was derived primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products and sales of new products.

We believe that new products are essential to enable our customers to advance their solutions and their market leadership positions. Additionally, we believe that new products tend to have a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue, but may be subject to higher price erosion as unit volumes grow, production experience is accumulated and costs decrease. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows for the fiscal years ended June 30: 2006 2005 Americas 25 % 22 % Far East North 23 35 Far East South 33 36 Europe 27 27 Total 28 30 Americas Region North and South America Revenue in the Americas region increased from the prior year period primarily due to stronger demand and new product offerings for electronic connector products, particularly in high performance applications. We experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year period partially because in 2006 the seasonally slow third fiscal quarter was instead relatively consistent with volumes in the second fiscal quarter. While we believe that year to date sales growth in the Americas region was negatively affected by the movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers, we experienced a reduction in this trend during the second half of fiscal 2006. However, we believe that this trend positively contributed to year to date sales in other regions of our business, especially in the Far East South region. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Revenue in local currencies was higher during fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 primarily due to stronger demand in the consumer and telecom markets. Demand in these markets increased steadily during fiscal 2006 and was stronger during the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year even though the second half of the year is generally seasonally lower for the telecommunications and consumer markets. The region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact, high performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for 35 Table of Contents third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as video and camera functionality. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our 3G technology business as global cell phone makers adopt this technology. During fiscal 2006, the region operated at a high capacity level with significant resources allocated to support increased demand in the Far East South region. Revenue between regions is generally recognized as intercompany revenue, which is excluded from the revenue by region table, above. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased during fiscal 2006 from the prior year. As a result, this region is our largest and fastest growing in terms of revenue. The revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by strong demand in the mobile phone and consumer products markets. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of 2006 as compared with the same period in the prior year primarily because the inventory correction and reduction in demand that occurred in the third fiscal quarter of 2005 did not recur in fiscal 2006. Our sales in China increased by 29.5% during fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period, due to customer demand supported by increased production capacity. The drivers of this growth included (i) overall higher demand in the mobile phone, consumer electronics and automotive markets, (ii) the trend of American, European and Japanese companies moving their design and production to China and (iii) greater penetration of Taiwanese multinational accounts. European Region For fiscal 2006, revenue as compared with the prior year increased primarily due to a slight recovery in demand for general connector products, increased sales of integrated products and additional penetration in the automotive market in which we participate. However, the overall trend toward movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers continued and we believe that this trend contributed to sales in other regions of our business, especially in the Far East South region. Customer revenue in the European region began improving during the third fiscal quarter and increased during the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year period. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to remain in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Gross Profit Gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in net revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2006, as compared with the prior year period, was higher primarily due to operating efficiencies gained in the Far East South and focus on higher margin products in the Americas. We estimate that we paid approximately $42.1 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period. These increases, along with the impact of price erosion, were partially offset by (i) an improved sales mix and product pruning, (ii) selective price increases that became effective during the second fiscal quarter of 2006, (iii) improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and (iv) favorable changes in currency exchange rates. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result of a stronger U.S. dollar compared with the yen during the period, exchange rates reduced our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. We estimate that the impact from currency transactions increased gross profit by approximately $35.5 million for fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year, but increased at a rate substantially lower than the rate of revenue growth. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to support the higher levels of business and the additional compensation expense for stock options as described in the following paragraph was offset by cost reductions due to the restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and other cost containment measures, especially in the European Region. 36 Table of Contents Effective in fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) which resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $13.3 million for fiscal 2006. Total share based compensation recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $30.5 million for fiscal 2006, of which $29.5 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and $1.0 million is included in restructuring costs. In fiscal 2005, we recognized $18.4 million of share based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. (See Note 19 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). The impact of currency translation decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $11.8 million for fiscal 2006. Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, increased to $140.9 million, or 4.9% of net revenue, for fiscal 2006, compared with 5.2% of net revenue last year. Restructuring Costs We recorded a pre tax charge of $26.4 million during fiscal 2006 and $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in connection with our restructuring to reduce costs, better optimize plant utilization and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring included facility closures that impacted our operations in the Americas and European regions. We reduced headcount by approximately 500 people after additions at the facilities where production was transferred. In the Americas region, we closed an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and ceased manufacturing in our Detroit area automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in the Detroit area will continue in operation. Production from these facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, we closed manufacturing facilities in Portugal and Ireland and reduced the size of a development center in Germany since announcing the restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We also closed a manufacturing facility in Slovakia. Production from these manufacturing facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2006 compared with 32.7% for fiscal 2005. The overall decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects higher fiscal 2006 earnings in countries with tax rates that are lower than the U.S. rate offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for losses incurred for which no tax benefit could be recorded. Fiscal 2005 reflects a charge for goodwill impairment and an increase in the valuation allowance. Backlog Our order backlog on June 30, 2006 was approximately $370.0 million, an increase of $110.5 million compared with $259.5 million at June 30, 2005. New orders for fiscal 2006 were $2,951.1 million, an increase of 18.5% compared with $2,489.8 million last year.

The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and the yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $72.1 million over the prior year period. We estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $88 million for fiscal 2005, compared with the prior year. The balance of the revenue increase came primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products, and sales of new products. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months was $764 million, or 30% of total revenue, in the current year, compared with $563 million, or 25% of revenue, for the prior year.

We have also seen some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Modest sales growth reflects the accelerated movement offshore of OEMs and contract manufacturers. Although management believes that most of the related revenue remained within Molex, it contributed to sales in other regions and reduced the Americas results. The revenue loss was partially offset with an increase in distribution sales, industrial sales and new product sales. Integrated product sales grew at a faster rate than connector products, with the most significant increase from high performance cables and fiber optics products for computer and industrial market applications, as well as for the telecommunications market, which has finally stabilized. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Customer revenue in the Far East North region in fiscal 2005 increased 5.3% from the prior year in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $24 million to the revenue increase. A robust business environment in Japan, a recovering economy in Korea and a steady flow of new products stimulated sales. The most significant growth in fiscal 2005 for Japan came from advanced digital home entertainment products such as digital still cameras and portable audio players and from consumer electronics products such as game machines and plasma display panels for flat screen TVs. Growth also came from hard disk drives and printers for the computer market. During the year, the region further capitalized on its ability to design more compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as TV and camera functionality. As more global phone makers move to 3G technology, we believe the region is well positioned to grow. Revenue to the industrial market increased, largely due to servo motor demand and customer investment in new semiconductor equipment. Automotive design wins in Japan were offset by decreased demand from Korean automakers due to Koreas sluggish economy. In Korea, modest strength in the electronics industry and the overall connector market was offset by reduced sales of personal computers. Revenue from integrated products grew at a faster rate than connector products in fiscal 2005. To counter pricing pressure, most integrated products are manufactured in our plant in Dalian, China, which underwent a 60% capacity expansion in fiscal 2005. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased 23.4% in fiscal 2005 in U.S. dollars, compared with the prior year. This region is now our largest and fastest growing segment. The revenue growth in this region was driven by strong demand across the consumer products and computer markets, as well as the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market. Our sales in China increased by 23% as a result of customer demand supported by increased production capacity. The biggest drivers of this growth were American, European and Japanese companies moving their design and production to China and greater penetration of Taiwanese multinational accounts. We experienced strong demand in the mobile phone, notebook and desktop computer, 39 Table of Contents consumer electronics and automotive markets. Products used in mobile phones constitute nearly one third of Far East South sales. Consumer electronics is another important market for the region. During the year, new products were introduced to keep pace with the ongoing migration from analog to digital technology. The region is coordinating opportunities with our Molex counterparts in Japan to have these products designed in the Far East North and produced in China. In the data, networking and computing arena, we shifted our focus from telecommunications infrastructure equipment to the far stronger server market. The region also grew in its traditional niche of personal computers and notebooks. The automotive business in the Far East South region, although still in its early stages, is accelerating. Our product pipeline grew to five times the 2004 level. The Big 3 (Daimler Chrysler, Ford and General Motors) and their suppliers moving to China want local design, procurement and production, which the region can provide. We plan to open a new plant in summer 2007 in Chengdu, considered the Detroit of China. The new plant is expected to be our largest worldwide and manufacture products for the automotive industry and for other industries as well. To offer customers a complete solution, the region maintains a balance between high precision, high technology manufacturing in Singapore and commoditized capability in China. European Region Customer revenue in Europe for fiscal 2005 increased 31.2% from the prior year in U.S. dollars. Our Cinch automotive acquisition, which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, accounted for $30.2 million of the $120.3 million in growth. The remaining revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by demand for mobile phones in the telecommunications market and products in the industrial market. The European connector market has been growing, albeit at a single digit pace. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to stay in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Integrated products now account for approximately 25% of the regions revenue. During the year, the region won projects from customers engaged in land and marine based oil exploration, as well as manufacturers requiring our products for industrial controls, testing equipment and power management. The region also increased its business with Nokia, the only major mobile phone company still producing in Europe. Management believes that the trend for European automakers, at least for the next five years, will be locally based and will rely on local distribution. We believe the region is in a good position to fulfill this need with a broad connector product offering and a robust new product pipeline. Key initiatives in the region include improving capacity utilization, shifting more manufacturing to the regions Eastern European locations, and using Six Sigma methodology to eliminate waste and enhance quality. Additionally, we are ahead of schedule with introducing lead free products and expect that we will deliver well in advance of the European compliance deadline. Gross Profit We were not able to fully offset the negative impact of price erosion discussed earlier with the leverage on the higher sales volume. The gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs. We estimate that we paid approximately $17 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in the current year compared with the same period last year. Although we implemented offsetting price increases to our distribution sales channel, we have not been as successful with the majority of our business. Our client mix skews toward large global customers and industries that make raising prices more difficult. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. The gross profit margin was negatively impacted as the yen and euro strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. We estimate this currency transaction impact to be approximately $6.5 million compared with the prior year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The Cinch acquisition added incremental selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $16.0 million as compared with the prior year. The currency translation impact further increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $16.9 million. Also, in connection with the resignation of our former auditor, responses to SEC comment inquiries, and internal investigations authorized by our Audit Committee, we estimate that legal, accounting and other costs during fiscal 2005 increased by approximately $9.9 million. Research and development expenditures for the year increased $14.6 million to $133.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenue, compared with 5.3% of net revenue last year. 40 Table of Contents Research and development expenditures in fiscal 2005 contributed to the release of approximately 384 new products during the year. In fiscal 2005, 30% of net revenue was derived from the sale of products we released within the last three years. We continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position. We were granted 775 new patents during the year, an increase of 36% over the prior year. Restructuring Costs We recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $27.9 million in fiscal 2005. We did not have material restructuring activity during fiscal 2004. Goodwill and Other Asset Impairments We also recorded a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of $22.9 million, during fiscal 2005. We did not record any material impairments during fiscal year 2004. Other Income Total other income was $19.9 million for fiscal 2005, compared with $18.7 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2004 results included a $10.4 million gain resulting from an IPO completed by an affiliate and the sale of stock of this affiliate, as well as a loss on investment of $5.0 million. Interest income, net of interest expense, was $6.4 million for fiscal 2005 compared with $3.7 million in the prior year period due to both higher cash balances held in the current year as well as higher interest rates. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 32.7% for fiscal 2005 compared with 27.4% in fiscal 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects the charge for the goodwill impairment we recognized in fiscal 2005 and an increase in the valuation allowance for net operating losses in foreign countries for which no tax benefit was recognized. These items were offset to some extent by the favorable resolution of various tax matters with tax authorities. Backlog Our order backlog on June 30, 2005 was approximately $259.5 million, a decline of $73.1 million compared with $332.6 million at June 30, 2004. The decrease in backlog was partially attributable to an increase in distribution bookings in June 2004 of approximately $36 million placed in advance of a price increase. In addition, during fiscal 2005 we provided vendor managed inventory programs to customers. Under this method, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. New orders for fiscal 2005 were $2,489.8 million, compared with $2,366.0 million last year. Quarterly Results of Operations The following discussion of results of operations that originally appeared in our Form 10 Qs filed for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our quarterly financial results, which is more fully described in the Managements Discussion and Analysis Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, above, and in Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K/A. 41 Table of Contents Quarterly Period Ended March 31, 2006 The tables below show our results of operations and the absolute and percentage change in those results from period to period (in thousands).

The following tables show the effect on the change in net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar: 42 Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 Local Currency Net Currency Translation Change Americas $ 29,593 $ 1,993 $ 31,586 Far East North 16,892 (12,015 ) 4,877 Far East South 54,073 801 54,874 Europe 23,119 (14,699 ) 8,420 Corporate and other 2,550 (628 ) 1,922 Net change $ 126,227 $ (24,548 ) $ 101,679 The change in revenue on a local currency basis is as follows: Three Months Ended Mar. 31, 2006 Americas 17.8 % Far East North 12.9 Far East South 29.5 Europe 18.7 Total 20.4 We continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows: Three Months Ended Mar. 31, 2006 Americas 19.5 % Far East North 11.4 Far East South 28.6 Europe 23.3 Total 26.6 Americas Region North and South America Revenue in the Americas region increased from the prior year comparable periods primarily due to stronger demand and new product offerings for electronic connector products, particularly in high performance applications. We experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the third fiscal quarter of 2006 as compared with the prior year quarter partially because in 2006 we did not experience seasonally lower volumes as generally experienced in fiscal third quarters. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Revenue in local currencies was higher during the third fiscal quarter as compared with the same quarter last year primarily due to stronger demand in the consumer and telecom markets. Demand in these markets increased at a higher rate during the third quarter as compared with the sequential quarter even though our third quarter is generally a seasonally lower quarter for the telecommunications and consumer markets. The region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as video and camera functionality. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our 3G technology business as global cell phone makers adopt this technology. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased from the prior year comparable periods. As a result, this region is our largest and fastest growing in terms of revenue. The revenue growth in this region was driven by strong demand across the mobile phone and consumer products markets. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the third fiscal quarter of 2006 as compared with the prior year quarter primarily because the inventory correction and reduction in demand that occurred in the third fiscal quarter of 2005 did not recur in the third fiscal quarter of 2006. 43 Table of Contents European Region Customer revenue in the European region increased during the third fiscal quarter primarily due to a recent improvement in the European automotive market. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to remain in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Gross Profit Gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in net revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2006, as compared with the prior year period, was higher primarily due to operating efficiencies gained in the Far East South and focus on higher margin products in the Americas. We estimate that we paid approximately $10.5 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins due to higher commodity prices in the three month period compared with the prior year period. These increases, along with the impact of price erosion, were partially offset by (i) an improved sales mix and product pruning, (ii) selective price increases that were effective during the second fiscal quarter of 2006, and (iii) improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. We estimate that the impact from currency transactions increased gross profit by approximately $11.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 compared with the prior year period. These increases were primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared with the yen during the three months ended March 31, 2006. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Effective in the 2006 fiscal year, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share based Payments, which resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Total share based compensation recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income was $8.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 compared with $3.8 million for the prior year period. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $6.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Restructuring Costs We recorded a pre tax charge of $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in connection with our restructuring to reduce costs, better optimize plant utilization and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring includes facility closures that impact our operations in the Americas and European regions. We estimate that we will reduce headcount by approximately 1,400 employees initially and then add back 800 employees at the facilities where production is being transferred, for a net reduction of 600 employees. In the Americas region, we are in the process of closing an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and ceasing manufacturing in our Detroit area automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in the Detroit area will continue in operation. Production from these facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, we closed manufacturing facilities in Portugal and Ireland and reduced the size of a development center in Germany since announcing the restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We are in the process of closing a manufacturing facility in Slovakia. Production from these manufacturing facilities is being transferred to existing plants within the region. We recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $4.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2006, which consisted primarily of severance and other employee related costs. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors including our efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. Implementation of this restructuring program is expected to continue through fiscal 2006 for which we anticipate an estimated pre tax charge of $20 million during fiscal 2006. 44 Table of Contents Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2006 compared with 31.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects changes in taxable income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Backlog Our order backlog on March 31, 2006 was approximately $354.3 million, an increase of $90.2 million compared with $264.1 million at March 31, 2005. Orders for the three months ended March 31, 2006 were $769.2 million, an increase of 26.5% compared with $608.0 million for the prior year period.

We experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Demand for these products was higher during the second fiscal quarter of 2006 as compared with the sequential quarter. Sales growth in the Americas region was affected by the movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers. We believe that this trend contributed to sales in other regions of our business, especially in the Far East South region. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Revenue in local currencies was higher during the second fiscal quarter as compared with the same quarter last year primarily due to stronger demand in the consumer and telecom markets. Demand for our product was lower during the first quarter primarily due to a slowdown related to the Japanese standard PDC phone format and a shortage of flash memory components used in flat panel displays. The region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market.

These increases were primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared with the yen during the three months ended December 31, 2005. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2005 included bad debt expense of approximately $3.0 million in connection with an account receivable from an automotive customer that filed for bankruptcy. A provision approximating $5.7 million was recorded for this receivable during the three months ended September 30, 2005, but because we factored this receivable during the three months ended December 31, 2005, bad debt expense was reduced by $2.7 million. Effective in the 2006 fiscal year, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share based Payments, which resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million for three months ended December 31, 2005. Total share based compensation recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income was $6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared with $4.8 million for the prior year period.

Implementation of this restructuring program is expected to continue through fiscal 2006 for which we anticipate an estimated pre tax charge of $20 million during fiscal 2006. Approximately 65% of the additional charges are expected to impact the Americas region with the remainder impacting Europe. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared with 27.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects increased taxable income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. 48 Table of Contents Backlog Our order backlog on December 31, 2005 was approximately $297.5 million, an increase of $11.8 million compared with $285.7 million at December 31, 2004.

We estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $17.7 million compared with the prior year. The balance of the revenue increase came primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products, and sales of new products. We continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position. Revenue derived from the sale of new products that we released within the last 36 months was $190.3 million, or 28.8% of total revenue, in the current year period, compared with $174.8 million, or 27.3% of revenue, for the prior year period. We operate in one product segment, the manufacture and sale of electronic components, and four regions. Revenue is recognized based on the location of the selling entity.

We also experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. New products generated 25% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2005. Modest sales growth in the Americas region reflects the movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers. We believe that this trend contributed to sales in other regions of our business, especially the Far East South region. Integrated product sales grew at a faster rate than connector products, with the most significant increase from high performance cables and fiber optics products for computer and industrial market applications, as well as for the telecommunications market. Far East North Region Japan and Korea Customer revenue in the Far East North region decreased $5.9 million, or 4.5%, in local currencies during the three months ended September 30, 2005 due to a seasonal slowdown related to the Japanese standard PDC phone format, and by a shortage of flash memory components used in flat panel displays that indirectly reduced demand for our product. Foreign currency translation offset approximately $1.7 million of the revenue decrease. New products generated 26% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2005. The region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region is developing new connectors for third generation (3G) phones, which in Japan include such high speed capabilities as TV and camera functionality. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our 3G technology business as global cell phone makers adopt this technology. Far East South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Taiwan and India Consistent with the migration of business from the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions to the Far East South region, customer revenue in the Far East South region increased $23.8 million, or 12.5%, in local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2005. This region is our largest and fastest growing region. Foreign currency translation added approximately $3.9 million of revenue during the period. The revenue growth in this region was driven by strong demand across the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market, consumer products and computer markets. New products generated 35% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2005. Our sales in China increased by 15% as a result of customer demand supported by increased production capacity. The drivers of this growth were American, European and Japanese companies moving their design and production to China and greater penetration of Taiwanese multinational accounts. We experienced strong demand in the mobile phone, notebook and desktop computer, consumer electronics and automotive markets. 50 Table of Contents European Region Customer revenue in the European region decreased $14.6 million, or 11.3%, in local currencies for the three months ended September 30, 2005, due primarily to weakness in the automotive industry. Foreign currency translation slightly offset this decrease by approximately $0.7 million of revenue during the period. New products generated 28% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2005. The decline in sales in the European region includes the movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers. We believe that this trend contributed to sales in other regions of our business, especially the Far East South region. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to stay in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2005, as compared with the prior year period, because we were not able to fully offset the negative impact of price erosion with the leverage on the higher sales volume. The gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs. We estimate that we paid approximately $3.8 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in the current quarter compared with the same period last year. Although we implemented offsetting price increases to our distribution sales channel, it has not been as successful with the majority of our business. Our customer mix skews toward large global accounts and industries that make raising prices more difficult. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. We estimate that the total currency translation had a positive impact on gross profit of approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared with the prior year quarter. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of a $5.7 million provision for a potentially uncollectible account receivable from an automotive customer that filed for bankruptcy and the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share based Payments. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $3.0 million. Total stock based compensation recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income was $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $4.7 million for the prior year period. Research and development expenditures increased $1.2 million to $34.6 million, or 5.2% of net revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2005, a percentage comparable to the prior year period. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $0.9 million. Restructuring Costs We recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $4.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2005, which consisted primarily of severance and other employee related costs. We recorded a pre tax charge of $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in connection with our restructuring to reduce costs, better optimize plant utilization and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring includes facility closures that impact our operations in the Americas and European regions. We estimate that we will reduce headcount by approximately 1,400 employees initially and then add back 800 employees at the facilities where production is being transferred, for a net reduction of 600 employees. In the Americas region, we will close an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and cease manufacturing in our Detroit area automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in the Detroit area will continue in operation. Production from these facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, we will close certain manufacturing facilities in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia, and reduce the size of a development center in Germany. Production from these manufacturing facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors including our efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. Implementation of this restructuring program is expected to continue through fiscal 2006 for which we anticipate an additional estimated 51 Table of Contents pre tax charge of $15 million to $20 million during fiscal 2006. Approximately 65% of the additional charges are expected to impact the Americas region with the remainder impacting Europe. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 28.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared with 27.7% for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects increased taxable income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Net Income Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was $46.2 million, down 18.4% from $56.6 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 included after tax charges of $3.7 million for restructuring costs and $3.6 million for a potentially uncollectible account receivable. Foreign currency translation increased net income by approximately $0.6 million as compared with the prior year quarter. Comprehensive income includes all non stockholder changes in equity and consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. Comprehensive income increased $0.3 million to $40.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005 from $39.8 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to a lower adverse effect from currency translation adjustments as compared with the prior year period, which resulted from the weaker U.S. dollar versus the yen and euro, offset by lower net income. Backlog Our order backlog on September 30, 2005 was approximately $288.0 million, a decline of $25.6 million compared with $313.6 million at September 30, 2004. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to vendor managed inventory programs to customers. Under this method, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously without impacting reported backlog. New orders for the three months ended September 30, 2005 were $693.2 million, compared with $622.4 million for the prior year period. Quarterly Period Ended March 31, 2005 Third Quarter Results Net Revenue Revenue was $618.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005, an increase of $47.1 million, or 8.3 percent, over last years third quarter of $571.5 million. Included in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 are incremental sales of $18.6 million from the Cinch acquisition that was completed on April 2, 2004. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and the yen, compared with the U.S. dollar also increased revenue by approximately $17 million over the prior year quarter. The Company estimates that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with last years third quarter. Revenue derived from the sale of new products released by the Company within the last 36 months was $195 million, or 32 percent of revenue, in the third quarter ended March 31, 2005 compared with $142 million, or 25 percent of revenue, in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 declined sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2005 by $33.2 million, primarily due to the lower sales of mobile phone products in the telecommunications market and products in the computer market. The Company estimates that revenues from these markets were down approximately $22 million and $10 million, respectively, due to a combination of model changeovers, slower production after a significant holiday ramp, and inventory adjustments by the Companys customers. In the Far East South region, customer revenue was $183.2 million, an increase of $31.1 million, or 20.4 percent, compared with $152.1 million in the prior year quarter. This region represents 30 percent of the Companys customer revenue. Foreign currency translation increased revenue in this region by approximately $3 million. The revenue growth in this region, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2004, was driven by higher demand for mobile phone products in the telecommunications market and products in the computer market. This region, particularly in China, continues to benefit from business transfers out of the Americas, Europe and Far East North regions, where manufacturing costs are generally higher. Customer revenue in the Americas region was $166.2 million, or 27 percent of the Companys customer revenue, down 8.5 percent from last years third quarter revenue of $181.6 million. The decline primarily resulted from reductions in the computer and 52 Table of Contents automotive markets when compared with the prior year quarter. Customer revenue in the Far East North region was $131.0 million, or 21 percent of the Companys customer revenue, an increase of $7.0 million, compared with $124.0 million in the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $6 million. In Europe, customer revenue was $123.5 million, or 20 percent of the Companys customer revenue, up $23.5 million, or 23.5 percent, from last years third quarter revenue of $100.0 million. The Companys Cinch acquisition added revenue of $18.6 million and foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately $6 million. Excluding these items, revenue in Europe was down slightly from last years third quarter. Gross Profit Gross profit was $201.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005, up $8.7 million, or 4.5 percent over the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin was 32.6 percent of net revenue, down from 33.7 percent in last years third quarter. The Company was not able to fully offset the negative impact of price erosion disclosed above with the leverage on the higher sales volume. The gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs. The Company estimates that it paid approximately $4 million more for metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 compared with last years third quarter. The Company has experienced some success in passing these cost increases to customers in its distribution sales channel. Sales through distributors represented approximately 20 percent of the Companys revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2005. However, any price increases in the remaining sales channels have not fully recovered the higher costs. In addition, the gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by the increased strength of the yen and euro relative to the U.S. dollar, as products manufactured by Molex in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. The Company estimates this effect to be approximately $2.5 million compared with the prior year third quarter. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $147.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005, as compared with $133.8 million in the prior year quarter. The Cinch acquisition added fixed expenses of approximately $4 million and the currency translation impact was approximately $4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company also incurred $2.5 million in higher legal and accounting costs arising from the previously announced resignation of the Companys former auditors and subsequent related events. As a percent of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 23.8 percent in the current quarter from 23.4 percent in last years third quarter. Research and development expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2005 were $32.8 million, or 5.4 percent of net revenue, up modestly from 5.3 percent of net revenue in the same period last year. Other Income Total other income was $8.5 million in the third quarter ended March 31, 2005, compared with $3.1 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included a $4.9 million pretax gain from additional consideration earned attributable to the previous sale of an investment in an affiliate. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 31.4 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with 27.2 percent for the prior year quarter. Net Income Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was $43.0 million, down from $45.1 million in last years third quarter. Foreign currency translation increased net income by $1.3 million when compared with last years third quarter. Earnings per share was $0.23 for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and $0.23 for the three months ended March 31, 2004. Backlog The Companys order backlog on March 31, 2005 was approximately $264.1 million, a slight increase of $0.9 million compared with $263.2 million as of March 31, 2004. Excluding the currency translation impact and the Cinch acquisition, backlog on March 31, 2005 declined by $8.2 million compared to the backlog on March 31, 2004. 53 Table of Contents New orders for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $608.0 million, comparable with $606.2 million in last years third quarter. Excluding the currency translation impact and the Cinch acquisition, orders for the third quarter were down $36.8 million from last years third quarter. Quarterly Period Ended December 31, 2004 Second Quarter Results Revenue was $651.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 19 percent over last years second quarter of $549.0 million. Revenue for the second quarter included $17.7 million from the Cinch acquisition in Europe that was completed on April 2, 2004. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and the yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $16.6 million over the prior year quarter. The Company estimates that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $20 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to last years second quarter. Revenue derived from the sale of new products released by the Company within the last 36 months was $206 million in the second quarter ended December 31, 2004, compared with $140 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Customer revenue in the Americas region was $170.9 million, up slightly from last years second quarter revenue of $167.5 million. In the Far East South region, customer revenue was $204.2 million, an increase of $51.6 million, or 34 percent, compared with the prior year second quarter. The revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by higher demand in the computer, telecommunications and consumer products markets. Customer revenue in the Far East North region was $133.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with $131.3 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency translation increased revenue by approximately $4.3 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was down slightly due to lower demand in the consumer products markets. In Europe, customer revenue was $128.8 million, up $43.4 million, or 51 percent, from last years second quarter revenue of $85.4 million. As noted above, the Companys Cinch acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, added revenue of $17.7 million. Foreign currency translation, led by the strong euro, also favorably impacted customer revenue by approximately $9.6 million. Gross profit was $209.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, up $40.2 million, or 24 percent over the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin was 32.1 percent of net revenue, up from 30.8 percent in last years second quarter. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volumes offset by the negative impact of the price erosion mentioned above and higher copper, gold and plastic resin material costs of $8.2 million. The Companys operating results were also negatively impacted by the increased strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar, as products manufactured by Molex in Japan are sold in the Far East South at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. The Company estimates this effect to be approximately $2.5 million, compared with the prior year second quarter. Also included in the results for the three months ended December 31, 2004 is a favorable adjustment of $1.5 million to reflect the Companys change in estimate to its inventory allowance. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $142.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $122.1 million in the prior year quarter. As a percent of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 22.2 percent in the prior year quarter to 21.9 percent in this years second quarter. Research and development expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were approximately $34.5 million, an increase of 25.5 percent when compared with the same period last year. Total other income was $3.9 million in the second quarter ended December 31, 2004, compared with $8.6 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a $10.4 million pretax gain from the sale of stock of an affiliate and an equity gain resulting from the IPO completed by this affiliate. The effective tax rate was 27 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the same rate as last years second quarter. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was $51.6 million, up 28 percent from $40.4 million in last years second quarter. Foreign currency translation increased net income by $1.0 million when compared with last years second quarter. Earnings per share was $0.27 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 compared with $0.21 in the prior year quarter. Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2004 Revenue was $640.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004, an increase of 29 percent over last years first quarter of $496.8 million. Revenue for the first quarter included $18 million from the automotive acquisition in Europe that was completed on April 2, 2004. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, principally the euro and the yen, compared with the U.S. dollar increased revenue by approximately $19 million over the prior year quarter. The Company estimates that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $20 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to last years first quarter. Revenue derived from the sale of new products released by the company within the last 36 months was $175 million in the first quarter ended September 30, 2004, compared with $126 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. 54 Table of Contents Customer revenue in the Americas region was $176.6 million, up 17 percent from last years first quarter revenue of $151.5 million, due to stronger demand for high speed products in the industrial market, which more than offset lower demand in automotive. In the Far East South region, customer revenue was $190.3 million, an increase of $47.5 million, or 33 percent, compared with the prior year first quarter. The revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by demand from the consumer products, computer and telecommunications markets, serving both local and multinational customers. Customer revenue in the Far East North region, increased 13 percent to $131.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with $116.3 million in the prior year quarter. Foreign currency translation contributed $8.8 million to the revenue increase. Demand for new products in the consumer products and telecommunication markets was also strong. In Europe, customer revenue was $128.4 million, up 73 percent from last years first quarter revenue of $74.4 million. As noted above, the Companys automotive acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, added revenue of $18 million. Foreign currency translation, led by the strong euro, also favorably impacted customer revenue by approximately $8 million. Gross profit was $220.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004, up $62.3 million, or 39 percent over the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin was 34.5 percent of net revenue, up from 31.9 percent in last years first quarter. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volumes, partially offset by the price erosion mentioned earlier. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $144.3 million for the first three months of fiscal 2005, as compared with $120.8 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 24.3 percent in the prior year quarter to 22.5 percent in this years first quarter. Research and development expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $33.4 million, an increase of 24 percent when compared with the same period last year. Total other income was $2.2 million in the first quarter ended September 30, 2004, compared with $3.4 million in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.7 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to 28.8 percent for last years first quarter. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was $56.6 million, up 94 percent from $29.2 million in last years first quarter. Foreign currency translation increased net income by $2.0 million. Earnings per share was $0.30 in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared with $0.15 in the prior year quarter. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position remains strong and we continue to be able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $485.5 million and $497.6 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we expect to utilize a portion of our existing cash to fund the acquisition of Woodhead. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Management believes that our liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current and future growth. We have historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists. Long term debt and obligations under capital leases at June 30, 2006 totaled $8.8 million. We have available lines of credit totaling $123.0 million at June 30, 2006. Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided from operating activities $ 443,856 $ 430,835 $ 292,031 Cash used for investing activities (240,779 ) (286,232 ) (158,358 ) Cash used for financing activities (189,814 ) (75,689 ) (86,108 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 9,796 6,411 7,890 Net increase in cash $ 23,059 $ 75,325 $ 55,455 Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities increased by $13.0 million for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2006 offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase was primarily due to the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year and reflects severance payments approximating $17.8 million in connection with the restructuring costs recorded in fiscal 2005. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Cash provided from operating activities increased by $138.8 million for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 due mainly to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2005 with steady working capital levels. 55 Table of Contents Investing Activities Capital expenditures increased $45.9 million for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 in order to provide increased capability in the Far East North region and increased capability and capacity in the Americas and Far East South regions. Capital expenditures increased $41.1 million for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to investments in increasing capability in the Far East North region. During 2005, we also sold our investment in an affiliate and generated cash from this transaction of $14.1 million. Cash flow from investing activities also includes proceeds from marketable securities in the net amount of $37.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $67.0 million in fiscal 2004 and investments in marketable securities in the net amount of $83.5 million in fiscal 2005. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our uses of or investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities Cash was used primarily for the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury stock. We purchased shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock totaling 6.0 million shares, 2.4 million shares and 2.7 million shares during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The aggregate cost of these purchases was $165.3 million, $58.2 million and $70.2 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $250.0 million of common stock though December 31, 2006. Approximately $50.1 million was remaining under the authorization as of June 30, 2006. We have a strong cash balance and cash flow and a low level of debt. We believe at this time that share repurchases are a good investment as compared with investing our cash in short term money instruments or marketable securities, particularly with the current low interest rates. We also use shares repurchased to replenish stock used for exercises of employee stock options and employee stock awards. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may impact our cash and borrowing requirements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2006, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands). Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 24,061 $ 10,847 $ 6,562 $ 2,802 $ 3,850 Capital lease obligations 4,306 2,555 1,661 73 17 Other long term liabilities 13,117 533 2,108 2,238 8,238 Debt obligations 8,061 968 2,193 4,732 168 Total (1) $ 49,545 $ 14,903 $ 12,524 $ 9,845 $ 12,273 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. 56 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (iv) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2006 and 2005. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in decreased net revenue of $30.8 million and decreased income from operations of $10.2 million for 2006, compared with the estimated results for 2006 using the average rates for 2005. Our $152.7 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2006 are principally debt instruments that generate interest income for us on temporary excess cash balances. These instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling us to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date. Our exposure related to derivative instrument transactions is, in the aggregate, not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest rate exposure is limited to our marketable securities and long term debt. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments (less than 12 months) and the fixed rate nature of our long term debt. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 57 Table of Contents
