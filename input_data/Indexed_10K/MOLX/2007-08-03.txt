Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion includes the use of organic net revenue growth, a non GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non GAAP Financial Measures below for additional information on the use of this measure. Overview Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electronic components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, data, consumer products, automotive and industrial markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and plasma televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. We believe that our sales mix is balanced, with growth prospects in a number of markets. Net revenues by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce. The approximate percentage of net revenue by market for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 is outlined below. % of Net Revenue 2007 2006 2005 Telecommunications 26 % 30 % 27 % Data Products 21 22 24 Automotive 18 18 19 Consumer 18 19 18 Industrial 15 9 9 Other 2 2 3 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors throughout the world. Our engineers work collaboratively with customers to develop products that meet their specific needs. Our connector products are designed to help manufacturers assemble their own products more efficiently. Our electronic components help enable manufacturers to break down their production into sub assemblies that can be built on different production lines, in different factories or by subcontractors. Our connectors allow these sub assemblies to be readily plugged together before selling the end product to a customer. Our connectors also enable users to connect together related electronic items, such as mobile phones to battery chargers and computers to printers. Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. We service our customers through our global manufacturing footprint. As of June 30, 2007, we operated 59 manufacturing plants, located in 19 countries on four continents. Manufacturing in many sectors has continued to move from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced the need for duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, our strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world. 25 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, we operated our business in the following four geographic regions: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific North and Asia Pacific South. In fiscal 2007, 51% of our revenue was derived from sales in the Asia Pacific North and Asia Pacific South regions. Economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, is anticipated to be greater than in the Americas and Europe. We believe that the business is positioned to benefit from this trend. Approximately 50% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are the worlds second largest manufacturer of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2007 of $3.3 billion increased 14.1% over fiscal 2006 net revenue of $2.9 billion. Organic net revenue growth was 11.8% for fiscal 2007 over 2006. Net income of $240.8 million for fiscal 2007 increased $4.7 million from $236.1 million reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2007 includes restructuring costs and asset impairments of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after tax). Fiscal 2006 net income included a restructuring charge of $26.4 million ($19.2 million after tax). On August 9, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Woodhead Industries, Inc. (Woodhead) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $238.1 million, including the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. Woodhead develops, manufactures and markets network and electrical infrastructure components engineered for performance in harsh, demanding, and hazardous industrial environments. The acquisition is a significant step in our strategy to expand our products and capabilities in the global industrial market. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. 26 Table of Contents Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $119.8 million at June 30, 2007. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. A valuation allowance of $1.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2007 to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of $1.3 million related to certain European net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $39.4 million at June 30, 2007. It is our policy to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We establish the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. At June 30, 2007, we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable contingencies. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or would be required to pay amounts in excess of accruals, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the benefit obligation, are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. We have typically used the market rate for AA/Aa rated corporate bonds for this assumption. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2007, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): 27 Table of Contents Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (5,108 ) $ (8,333 ) $ (338 ) $ (103 ) Decrease 50 basis points 5,580 9,444 329 175 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A (496 ) (536 ) Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A 443 420 Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. A 100 basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Effect on total annual service and interest cost: Increase 100 basis points $ 1,287 $ 1,476 $ 1,073 Decrease 100 basis points (1,014 ) (1,211 ) (908 ) Effect on APBO: Increase 100 basis points $ 9,057 $ 9,951 $ 8,655 Decrease 100 basis points (7,270 ) (8,164 ) (7,325 ) Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs and Asset Impairments We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. We recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are expensed and accrued when it is determined that a liability is probable, which is generally 28 Table of Contents after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized upon approval of a restructuring plan by management or in future accounting periods when terminated employees continue to provide service. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The purpose of SFAS No. 157 is to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for us on July 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the financial statement impact of adopting SFAS No. 157, but we do not expect its adoption to have a significant transition effect. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for us on July 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the financial statement impact of adopting SFAS No. 159, but we do not expect its adoption to have a significant transition effect. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which, among other things, requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The provisions of FIN 48 were effective for us on July 1, 2007. We do not expect its adoption to have a significant effect on our financial statements. Results of Operations Net revenue for fiscal 2007 of $3.3 billion increased 14.1% over fiscal 2006 net revenue of $2.9 billion. Organic net revenue growth was 11.8% for fiscal 2007 over 2006. Net income of $240.8 million for fiscal 2007 increased $4.7 million from $236.1 million reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2007 includes restructuring costs and asset impairments of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after tax). Fiscal 2006 net income included a restructuring charge of $26.4 million ($19.2 million after tax). The Woodhead acquisition added $202.5 million of net revenue and $12.2 million of income from operations to the consolidated operating results in fiscal 2007. The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net 29 Table of Contents revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands): Percentage Percentage Percentage 2007 of Revenue 2006 of Revenue 2005 of Revenue Net revenue $ 3,265,874 100.0 % $ 2,861,289 100.0 % $ 2,554,458 100.0 % Cost of Sales 2,249,166 68.9 % 1,918,659 67.1 % 1,721,796 67.4 % Gross Profit 1,016,708 31.1 % 942,630 32.9 % 832,662 32.6 % Selling, general administrative 658,289 20.1 % 606,532 21.1 % 576,354 22.6 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 36,869 1.1 % 26,354 0.9 % 30,168 1.2 % Goodwill impairment 22,876 0.9 % Income from operations 321,550 9.9 % 309,744 10.8 % 203,264 7.9 % Other income, net 16,707 0.5 % 18,140 0.7 % 19,937 0.8 % Income before income taxes 338,257 10.4 % 327,884 11.5 % 223,201 8.7 % Income taxes 97,489 3.0 % 91,793 3.2 % 73,085 2.8 % Net income $ 240,768 7.4 % $ 236,091 8.3 % $ 150,116 5.9 % Net Revenue We sell our products in five primary markets. A summary follows of the estimated change in revenue from each market during the fiscal years ended June 30: 2007 2006 2005 Telecommunications 3 % 25 % 33 % Data Products 6 3 5 Automotive 11 6 27 Consumer 9 19 (3 ) Industrial 100 12 2 Telecommunications was our best performing market in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 but increased only slightly in fiscal 2007. While we experienced strong revenue growth in the telecommunications market in late fiscal 2006 and early 2007, we experienced a sharp decline in revenue from mobile phone customers during the second half of fiscal 2007. While the majority of these issues were customer specific, the overall mobile phone market is currently being driven by growth in entry level phones having lower functionality and connector content, resulting in lower demand for our products. We believe this is the result of initial demand in the developing economies, and that these large markets will eventually transition to more sophisticated higher connector content devices. While revenue in the consumer and data markets increased in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006, revenue in these markets declined during the second half of fiscal 2007 compared with the same period in fiscal 2006, due in part to concerns regarding consumer spending as well as lingering inventory corrections at some of our larger customers. Woodhead contributed 84% of the 100% growth in industrial sales in fiscal 2007 compared with the prior year. 30 Table of Contents The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Change in net revenue due to: Organic net revenue growth $ 141,887 $ 337,621 $ 233,297 Currency translation 60,219 (30,790 ) 72,143 Woodhead acquisition 202,479 Total $ 404,585 $ 306,831 $ 305,440 Organic net revenue growth percentage 5.0 % 13.2 % 10.4 % Organic net revenue growth was derived primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products and sales of new products. We estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $131.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with the prior year. A significant portion of the price erosion occurred in our mobile phone connector products, which are part of our telecommunications market. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to the strengthening of the euro, Singapore dollar and Korean won against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005 was principally due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the yen and euro. We operate in one product segment, the manufacture and sale of electronic components, and four regions. Woodhead is included in corporate and other for fiscal 2007. Revenue is recognized based on the location of the selling entity. The following table sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region for the periods indicated (in thousands): Percentage Percentage Percentage (in thousands) 2007 of Revenue 2006 of Revenue 2005 of Revenue Americas $ 783,464 24.0 % $ 793,296 27.7 % $ 701,470 27.5 % Asia Pacific North 510,311 15.6 % 450,860 15.8 % 461,873 18.0 % Asia Pacific South 1,128,034 34.5 % 1,036,892 36.2 % 835,368 32.7 % Europe 556,096 17.0 % 511,375 17.9 % 505,953 19.8 % Corporate and other 287,969 8.9 % 68,866 2.4 % 49,794 2.0 % Total $ 3,265,874 100.0 % $ 2,861,289 100.0 % $ 2,554,458 100.0 % We believe that the recent trend of moving original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers production to lower cost countries in Asia and Eastern Europe is positively contributing to revenue in those regions of our business. This trend has resulted in lower revenue growth in higher cost regions such as the Americas and Western Europe. 31 Table of Contents We continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position. We believe that new products are essential to enable our customers to advance their solutions and their market leadership positions. Additionally, we believe that new products tend to have a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue, but may be subject to higher price erosion as unit volumes grow, production experience is accumulated and costs decrease. Revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last 36 months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows for the fiscal years ended June 30: 2007 2006 2005 Americas 25 % 25 % 22 % Asia Pacific North 30 23 35 Asia Pacific South 31 33 36 Europe 24 27 27 Total 27 % 28 % 30 % Americas Region North and South America The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Change in revenue due to: Organic net revenue growth $ (10,746 ) $ 82,322 $ 13,011 Currency translation 914 9,504 2,330 Total $ (9,832 ) $ 91,826 $ 15,341 Organic net revenue growth percentage (1.4 )% 11.7 % 1.9 % Revenue for the Americas region decreased by $9.8 million, or 1.2%, in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006. The most significant factor in this decline was due to closure of our production facilities in Brazil. Brazil revenue for fiscal 2007 declined $41.2 million compared with the prior year period. The Americas region was favorably impacted by higher revenue in the automotive market, which was primarily due to new program wins and higher electronic content in vehicles. Revenue for the Americas region increased by $91.8 million, or 13.1%, in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005. The increase was mostly due to stronger demand and new product offerings for electronic connector products, particularly in high performance applications. We experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market, resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period partially because in 2006 the seasonally slow third fiscal quarter was instead relatively consistent with volumes in the second fiscal quarter. Asia Pacific North Region Japan and Thailand The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 32 Table of Contents 2007 2006 2005 Change in revenue due to: Organic net revenue growth $ 68,841 $ 12,652 $ (11,973 ) Currency translation (9,390 ) (23,665 ) 24,282 Total $ 59,451 $ (11,013 ) $ 12,309 Organic net revenue growth percentage 15.3 % 2.7 % (2.7 )% Revenue for the Asia Pacific North region increased by $59.5 million, or 13.2%, in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006. Organic net revenue growth was 15.3% in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006 mostly due to stronger demand in the consumer and industrial markets. We believe that we are well positioned for growth in the satellite radio and games segment, where we have significant connector content in Pachinko game machines and on the new Wii machine and the Sony PS3. While demand for high end mobile phones declined during the second half of fiscal 2007, the region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact, higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market. The region has developed connectors for third generation (3G) phones. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our 3G technology business as global cell phone makers adopt this technology. Organic net revenue growth for the Asia Pacific North region increased by $12.7 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to stronger demand in the consumer and telecom markets. Demand in these markets increased steadily during fiscal 2006 and was stronger during the second half of fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year even though the second half of the year is generally seasonally lower for the telecommunications and consumer markets. The Asia Pacific North region generally operates at a high capacity level with significant resources allocated to support higher demand in the Asia Pacific South region. Revenue between regions is generally recognized as intercompany revenue, which is excluded from the revenue by region table above. Asia Pacific South Region Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, Taiwan and India The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Change in revenue due to: Organic net revenue growth $ 65,071 $ 192,370 $ 152,160 Currency translation 26,071 9,154 8,098 Total $ 91,142 $ 201,524 $ 160,258 Organic net revenue growth percentage 6.3 % 23.0 % 22.5 % Revenue for the Asia Pacific South region increased by $91.1 million, or 8.8%, in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006. Organic net revenue growth was 6.3% in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006 mostly due to demand from the mobile phone, computer and telecommunications infrastructure sectors, although beginning during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we experienced lower demand in the mobile phone and computer businesses. This lower demand resulted in Asia Pacific South revenue declining during the second half of fiscal 2007 and a lower overall growth rate for the year compared with fiscal 2006 and 2005 growth. The Asia Pacific South region is our largest and has generally been one of our fastest growing in terms of revenue. Sales in China represent 63% of total Asia Pacific South sales for the year ended June 30, 2007 increasing 12.1% compared with the prior year period. The drivers of this growth included overall higher demand in the mobile phone, consumer electronics and computer markets and the trend of companies 33 Table of Contents moving their design and production to China. A significant portion of our integrated products that require a higher level of manual assembly are produced in China. Organic net revenue growth for the Asia Pacific South region increased by $192.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to strong demand in the mobile phone and consumer products markets. Demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of 2006 compared with the same period in the prior year primarily because the inventory correction and reduction in demand that occurred in the third fiscal quarter of 2005 did not recur in fiscal 2006. European Region The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Change in revenue due to: Organic net revenue growth $ 5,458 $ 30,958 $ 85,755 Currency translation 39,263 (25,536 ) 34,551 Total $ 44,721 $ 5,422 $ 120,306 Organic net revenue growth percentage 1.1 % 6.1 % 22.2 % Revenue for the European region increased by $44.7 million, or 8.8%, in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006, mostly due to currency translation. Organic net revenue growth was primarily due to higher revenue from consumer products in the industrial market. Revenue for the European region increased by $5.4 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005. Organic net revenue growth of $31.0 million was mostly due to a slight recovery in demand for general connector products, increased sales of integrated products and additional penetration in the automotive market in which we participate. Customer revenue in the European region began improving during the third fiscal quarter and increased during the second half of fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year period. The region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to remain in Europe. These include connectors and integrated products for industrial, medical and automotive applications. Gross Profit The following table provides summary of gross profit and gross margin compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Gross profit $ 1,016,708 $ 942,630 $ 832,662 Gross margin 31.1 % 32.9 % 32.6 % The impact of certain margin drivers compared with the prior year period was as follows (in thousands): 2007 2006 Price erosion $ (131,435 ) $ (78,962 ) Higher commodity costs (1) (58,536 ) (42,124 ) Currency translation 12,595 (22,260 ) Currency transaction 18,166 31,328 (1) Commodity costs are primarily related to metal alloys (primarily copper), gold and plastic resins. 34 Table of Contents Gross profit for the company increased by $74.1 million, or 7.9%, in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006. Gross margin declined to 31.1% in fiscal 2007 from 32.9% in the prior year primarily due to higher price erosion, higher raw material costs and increased depreciation expense. The negative effect from price erosion that impacted our mobile phone business beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 continued throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Higher commodity costs, along with the impact of price erosion, were partially offset by selective price increases that were effective in February and September 2006, improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and favorable changes in currency exchange rates. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. The increase in gross profit due to currency transaction gains was primarily due to a weaker yen relative to other currencies during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Gross profit for the company increased by $110.0 million, or 13.2%, in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005. Gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in net revenue. Gross margin during fiscal 2006, compared with the prior year period, was higher primarily due to operating efficiencies gained in the Asia Pacific South region, focus on higher margin products in the Americas region and selective price increases, offset by price erosion and higher commodity costs. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended June 30, 2007 were as follows (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Selling, general administrative $ 658,289 $ 606,532 $ 576,354 Selling, general administrative as a percentage of revenue 20.1 % 21.1 % 22.6 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 36,869 26,354 30,168 The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net revenue in fiscal 2007 and compared with 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a lower cost structure resulting from our 2005 restructuring initiative, lower incentive compensation expense in 2007 and specific cost containment activities. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $12.4 million for fiscal 2007 compared with 2006 and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $11.8 million for fiscal 2006 compared with 2005. Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, were 4.9% of net revenue for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and 5.2% of net revenue for fiscal 2005. Effective July 1, 2007, we transitioned to a global organizational structure that consists of product focused divisions. This structure consists of five global divisions and one worldwide sales and marketing organization. When fully implemented, we expect the new structure to enable us to work more effectively as a global team to meet customer needs as well as to better leverage our design expertise and the low cost production centers around the world. The new worldwide sales and marketing organization structure will enhance our ability to sell any product, to any customer, anywhere in the world. In connection with this transition, we undertook in fiscal 2007 a multi year restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital. A majority of the plan relates to facilities 35 Table of Contents located in the Americas and European regions and in general, the movement of manufacturing activities at these plants to other facilities. A portion of this plan involves cost savings or other actions that do not result in incremental expense, such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending and organizational efficiencies. This plan includes headcount reduction targets throughout the company, and we expect to achieve these targets through ongoing employee attrition and terminations as detailed below. We expect to complete the actions under this plan by June 30, 2009, and incur restructuring and asset impairment costs related to these actions ranging from $100 $125 million, of which the impact on each region will be determined as the actions become more certain. We expect that when fully implemented by the close of fiscal 2009, the annualized pretax savings from the restructuring activities will be in the range of $75 to $100 million. We estimate pretax savings of $20 to $25 million in fiscal 2008. Management and the Board of Directors approved several actions related to this plan during fiscal 2007 that resulted in severance and benefit costs of $26.7 million for the reduction of approximately 335 employees. A substantial majority of employee terminations occurred within our Ireland manufacturing operations and various administrative functions in the Americas and European regions. In addition, we have vacated or plan to vacate several buildings and are holding these buildings and related assets for sale. Our plans resulted in an impairment charge of $8.7 million to write down to fair value less the cost to sell the land, building and equipment asset groupings. The fair value of the asset groupings was determined using various valuation techniques. Other restructuring related costs approximated $1.5 million. During fiscal 2005, we decided to close certain operations in the Americas and European regions in order to reduce operating costs and better align our manufacturing capacity with customer needs. Production from the operations closed has been transferred to existing plants within the respective regions. Also included in the restructuring charge are costs to reduce our selling, general and administrative costs in the Americas, Europe and at the corporate office. We reduced headcount by approximately 500 people after additions at the facilities where production was transferred. We substantially completed these restructuring activities as of June 30, 2006. We incurred charges of $26.4 million in fiscal 2006, of which $23.5 million was related to severance costs and $2.9 million was related to asset impairments. We incurred charges of $30.2 million in fiscal 2005, of which $15.7 million was related to severance costs and $14.5 million was related to asset impairments. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for the three years ended June 30, 2007 was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Effective tax rate 28.8 % 28.0 % 32.7 % The effective rate in fiscal 2007 was substantially unchanged from 2006. The rate decreased in fiscal 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment of $22.9 million in 2005 and greater valuation allowances in 2005 for losses incurred for which no tax benefit could be recorded. Backlog Backlog as of the three years ended June 30, 2007 was as follows (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Backlog $ 332,479 $ 369,966 $ 259,472 Backlog decreased as of June 30, 2007 compared with June 30, 2006, primarily due to a decrease in demand at the end of fiscal 2007, particularly in the mobile communications market, and an increase in 36 Table of Contents vendor managed inventory programs to customers. Under the vendor managed inventory program, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. The decrease in backlog as of June 30, 2007 compared with 2006 was offset by the acquisition of Woodhead, which had backlog of $24.3 million on June 30, 2007. Backlog increased as of June 30, 2006 compared with June 30, 2005, primarily due to higher demand at the end of fiscal 2006. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net revenue growth, which is included in the discussion above, is a non GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net revenue growth (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) and organic net revenue growth (the non GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and the acquisition of Woodhead. Organic net revenue growth is a useful measure which we use to measure the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition activity. We believe organic net revenue growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net revenue growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net revenue growth together with GAAP measures such as net revenue growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net revenue growth in Results of Operations above utilizes organic net revenue growth as management does internally. Because organic net revenue growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net revenue growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net revenue growth is a non GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by using net revenue growth in combination with our U.S. GAAP net revenue. The tables presented in Results of Operations above provide reconciliations of U.S. GAAP reported net revenue growth to organic net revenue growth. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position remains strong and we continue to be able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $460.9 million and $485.5 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which approximately $371.7 was in non U.S. accounts as of June 30, 2007. Transfering cash, cash equivalent or marketable securities to U.S. accounts from non U.S. accounts could subject us to additional U.S. repatriation income tax. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Management believes that our liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current and future growth. We have historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists. Long term debt and obligations under capital leases at June 30, 2007 totaled $130.8 million. We have available lines of credit totaling $ 181.6 million at June 30, 2007. 37 Table of Contents Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided from operating activities $ 451,434 $ 443,856 $ 430,835 Cash used for investing activities (446,129 ) (240,779 ) (286,232 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 28,529 (189,814 ) (75,689 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 11,712 9,796 6,411 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 45,546 $ 23,059 $ 75,325 Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities increased by $7.6 million for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2006 offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase was primarily due to the revenue growth for fiscal 2007 compared with the prior year. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Cash provided from operating activities increased by $13.0 million for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2006 offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase was primarily due to the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year. Investing Activities On August 9, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Woodhead in an all cash transaction for approximately $238.1 million, including the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures increased $20.1 million for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 in order to provide increased capacity in the Americas, Asia Pacific North and European regions. Capital expenditures increased $45.9 million for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 in order to provide increased capability in the Asia Pacific North region and increased capability and capacity in the Americas and Asia Pacific South regions. Cash flow from investing activities also includes proceeds from marketable securities in the net amount of $71.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $37.3 million in fiscal 2006 and investments in marketable securities in the net amount of $83.5 million in fiscal 2005. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our uses of or investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities In order to fund the cash portion of our investment in Woodhead made during fiscal 2007, we entered into two term notes aggregating 15 billion Japanese yen ($121.8 million) and borrowed $44.0 million on our unsecured revolving credit line. The term notes have three year terms with weighted average fixed interest rates approximating 1.3%. The $44.0 million that we borrowed on our unsecured revolving line of credit was repaid during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. We purchased shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock totaling 1.2 million shares, 6.0 million shares and 2.4 million shares during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The aggregate cost of these purchases was $34.9 million, $165.3 million and $58.2 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $250.0 million of common stock through September 30, 2007. Approximately $15.2 million was remaining under the authorization as of June 30, 2007. 38 Table of Contents We have sufficient cash balances and cash flow to support our planned growth. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may impact our cash requirements and debt balances. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2007, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands). Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 36,014 $ 13,870 $ 9,616 $ 5,972 $ 6,556 Capital lease obligations 5,954 2,930 2,910 112 2 Other long term liabilities 14,663 2,983 2,169 1,059 8,452 Debt obligations 129,046 1,280 123,929 3,633 204 Total (1) $ 185,677 $ 21,063 $ 138,624 $ 10,776 $ 15,214 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Debt and capital lease obligations include interest payments. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (iv) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2007 and 2006. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $60.2 million and increased income from operations of $1.2 million for 2007, compared with the estimated results for 2007 using the average rates for 2006. Our $82.5 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2007 are principally debt instruments that generate interest income for us on temporary excess cash balances. These instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling us to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date. Our exposure related to derivative instrument transactions is, in the aggregate, not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest rate exposure is limited to our marketable securities and long term debt. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments (less than 12 months) and the fixed rate nature of our long term debt. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 40 Table of Contents
