Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion includes the use of organic net revenue growth, a non GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non GAAP Financial Measures below for additional information on the use of this measure. Overview Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electronic components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, data, consumer products, automotive and industrial markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and plasma televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. We believe that our sales mix is balanced, with growth prospects in a number of markets. Net revenues by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and changes in their revenue levels and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce. The approximate percentage of net revenue by market for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 is outlined below. Percentage of Net Revenue 2008 2007 2006 Consumer 18 % 18 % 19 % Telecommunication 26 26 30 Automotive 18 18 18 Data 22 21 22 Industrial 13 15 9 Other 3 2 2 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors throughout the world. Our engineers work collaboratively with customers to develop products that meet their specific needs. Our connector products are designed to help manufacturers assemble their own products more efficiently. Our electronic components help enable manufacturers to break down their production into sub assemblies that can be built on different production lines, in different factories or by subcontractors. Our connectors allow these sub assemblies to be readily plugged together before selling the end product to a customer. Our connectors also enable users to connect together related electronic items, such as mobile phones to battery chargers and computers to printers. Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. We service our customers through our global manufacturing footprint. As of June 30, 2008, we operated 45 manufacturing locations, located in 17 countries. Manufacturing in many sectors has continued to move from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced the need for duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, our strategy has been to 22 Table of Contents consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world. On July 1, 2007 we implemented a new global organizational structure that consists of five product focused divisions and one worldwide sales and marketing organization. The new structure enables us to work more effectively as a global team to meet customer needs as well as to better leverage our design expertise and our low cost production centers around the world. The new worldwide sales and marketing organization structure enhances our ability to sell any product, to any customer, anywhere in the world. In connection with our reorganization, we undertook a multi year restructuring plan in fiscal 2007 designed to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital as a result of a new global organization that was effective July 1, 2007. We have revised our initial estimate and now expect to incur total restructuring and asset impairment costs related to this restructuring ranging from $125 to $140 million, of which the impact on each segment will be determined as the actions become more certain. Net restructuring cost during fiscal 2008 was $31.2 million, resulting in cumulative costs since we announced this restructuring plan of $68.1 million. During fiscal 2008, we operated our business in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In fiscal 2008, 52% of our revenue was derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region. We expect greater economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, than in the Americas and Europe. We believe that the business is positioned to benefit from this trend. Approximately 48% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are the worlds second largest manufacturer of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. Our financial results are influenced by factors in the markets in which we operate and by our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. Marketplace factors include competition for customers, raw material prices, product and price competition, economic conditions in various geographic regions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, fluctuations in customer demand, patent and intellectual property issues, litigation results and legal and regulatory developments. We expect that the marketplace environment will remain highly competitive. Our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges, including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate manufacturing to such demand, manage rising raw material costs, develop, manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines, control operating costs, and attract, motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational, financial and management information systems. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2008 of $3.3 billion increased 1.9% over fiscal 2007. Organic net revenue declined 3.3% for fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. Net income of $215.4 million for fiscal 2008 decreased $25.4 million from $240.8 million reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2008 results include a restructuring charge of $31.2 million ($21.0 million after tax) and tax charges related to changes in prior years foreign tax credits of $17.2 million. Restructuring charges of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after tax) were recorded in fiscal 2007. On August 9, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Woodhead Industries, Inc. (Woodhead) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $238.1 million, including the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. Woodhead develops, manufactures and markets network and electrical infrastructure components engineered for performance in harsh, demanding, and hazardous industrial environments. 23 Table of Contents The acquisition is a significant step in our strategy to expand our products and capabilities in the global industrial market. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Income Taxes As a result of the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) interpretation No. 48, Accounting for the Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), effective July 1, 2007, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Prior to adoption of FIN 48, our policy was to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We established the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $86.0 million at June 30, 2008. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of 24 Table of Contents how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. Entities with net operating losses were able to utilize $1.1 million of these losses during fiscal 2008. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $38.3 million at June 30, 2008. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the pension benefit obligation (PBO), are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The discount rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each years expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for U.S. pension obligations. The discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by using a yield curve approach or by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets. In those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. 25 Table of Contents The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2008, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (3,795 ) $ (8,306 ) $ (325 ) $ (103 ) Decrease 50 basis points 4,104 9,331 336 123 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A (566 ) (689 ) Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A 566 689 Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. A 100 basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Increase (decrease) in total annual service and interest cost: Increase 100 basis points $ 1,219 $ 1,287 $ 1,476 Decrease 100 basis points (968 ) (1,014 ) (1,211 ) Increase (decrease) in APBO: Increase 100 basis points $ 7,987 $ 9,057 $ 9,951 Decrease 100 basis points (6,452 ) (7,270 ) (8,164 ) Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are generally based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. 26 Table of Contents Restructuring Costs and Asset Impairments We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. We recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are expensed and accrued when it is determined that a liability is probable, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized upon approval of a restructuring plan by management or in future accounting periods when terminated employees continue to provide service. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R states that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred with restructuring costs being expensed in periods after the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states that business combinations will result in all assets and liabilities of the acquired business being recorded at their fair values. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 141R effective July 1, 2009. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will depend on the nature and extent of business combinations occurring on or after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160) an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 requires identification and presentation of ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than us in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the equity. It also requires that (1) the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, (2) changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, and (3) when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. This statement is effective for us on July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 160, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161) an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS 161 requires 27 Table of Contents enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thus improves the transparency of financial reporting. This statement is effective for us on July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 161, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. Results of Operations Net revenue for fiscal 2008 of $3.3 billion increased 1.9% over fiscal 2007. Organic net revenue declined 3.3% for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Net income of $215.4 million for fiscal 2008 decreased $25.4 million from $240.8 million reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2008 results include a restructuring charge of $31.2 million ($21.0 million after tax) and tax charges related to changes in prior years foreign tax credits of $17.2 million. Restructuring charges of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after tax) were recorded in fiscal 2007. The Woodhead acquisition added $202.5 million of net revenue and $12.2 million of income from operations to the consolidated operating results in fiscal 2007. The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands): Percentage of Percentage of Percentage of 2008 Revenue 2007 Revenue 2006 Revenue Net revenue $ 3,328,347 100.0 % $ 3,265,874 100.0 % $ 2,861,289 100.0 % Cost of sales 2,314,112 69.5 % 2,249,166 68.9 % 1,918,659 67.1 % Gross profit 1,014,235 30.5 % 1,016,708 31.1 % 942,630 32.9 % Selling, general administrative 665,038 20.0 % 658,289 20.1 % 606,532 21.1 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 31,247 0.9 % 36,869 1.1 % 26,354 0.9 % Income from operations 317,950 9.6 % 321,550 9.9 % 309,744 10.8 % Other income, net 20,698 0.6 % 16,707 0.5 % 18,140 0.7 % Income before income taxes 338,648 10.2 % 338,257 10.4 % 327,884 11.5 % Income taxes 123,211 3.7 % 97,489 3.0 % 91,793 3.2 % Net income $ 215,437 6.5 % $ 240,768 7.4 % $ 236,091 8.3 % Net Revenue We sell our products in five primary markets. A summary follows of the estimated change in revenue from each market during the fiscal years ended June 30: 2008 2007 Consumer 3 % 9 % Telecommunications 3 3 Automotive 7 11 Data 4 6 Industrial (11 ) 100 Following are highlights of revenue changes by these primary markets: Consumer market revenue increased in fiscal 2008 due to higher demand for our connectors used in home entertainment products. However, revenue growth this year has moderated in part due to our customers concerns regarding global economies. 28 Table of Contents Telecommunications market revenue was higher in fiscal 2008 due to higher demand for our networking products. While we experienced strong revenue growth in the telecommunications market in late fiscal 2006 and early 2007, we experienced a sharp decline in revenue from mobile phone customers during the second half of fiscal 2007. This negative trend began to stabilize during the second half of fiscal 2008. Revenue in the automotive sector was higher in fiscal 2008 and 2007 primarily due to higher revenue in Europe and Asia, a portion of which is attributed to the currency translation impact of a weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2008. Revenue in the U.S. automotive market was lower in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The automotive market has benefited from new products reflecting higher electronic content in automobiles and an increase in revenue of our standard products to traditional customers. We believe that the number of automobiles manufactured by our customers was lower in fiscal 2008; however, our customers have trended toward reducing their vendor list, which when coupled with the higher electronic content used in new automobiles, has resulted in an increase in our revenue. Data market revenue increased in fiscal 2008 due to our customers releases of new high end products and their expansion in new optical and high speed technologies, for which we offer a strong product line. Revenue growth in the data market has moderated during this year due in part to our customers concerns regarding global economies. The industrial market declined due largely to a cable assembly product that had high revenue levels in fiscal 2007 but little revenue in fiscal 2008 because our customer was enhancing their product line. Woodhead contributed 84% of the 100% growth in industrial sales in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The following table shows the percentage of net revenue by geographic region: 2008 2007 2006 Americas 27.6 % 28.7 % 28.6 % Asia Pacific 52.0 51.1 52.6 Europe 20.4 20.2 18.8 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal years (in thousands): 2008 2007 Net revenue for prior year $ 3,265,874 $ 2,861,289 Components of net revenue (decrease) increase: Organic net revenue growth (decline) (106,863 ) 141,887 Currency translation 169,336 60,219 Woodhead acquisition 202,479 Total change in net revenue from prior year 62,473 404,585 Net revenue for current year $ 3,328,347 $ 3,265,874 Organic net revenue growth (decline) as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (3.3 )% 5.0 % Organic net revenue declined $106.9 million in fiscal 2008 due to lower revenue in local currencies for the consumer, telecommunications and data markets in our connector segment. We estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately $132.8 million in fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year. A significant portion of the price erosion occurred in our mobile phone connector products, which are part of our telecommunications market. 29 Table of Contents The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was principally due to the general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to the strengthening of the euro, Singapore dollar and Korean won against the U.S. dollar. The following tables show the effect on the change in geographic net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar (in thousands): June 30, 2008 June 30, 2007 Local Currency Net Local Currency Net Currency Translation Change Currency Translation Change Americas $ (23,304 ) $ 3,637 $ (19,667 ) $ 116,022 $ 1,640 $ 117,662 Asia Pacific (26,974 ) 89,405 62,431 145,537 17,158 162,695 Europe (54,735 ) 76,294 21,559 74,165 47,148 121,313 Corporate Other (1,850 ) (1,850 ) 2,915 2,915 Net change $ (106,863 ) $ 169,336 $ 62,473 $ 338,639 $ 65,946 $ 404,585 The change in revenue on a local currency basis as of June 30 was as follows: 2008 2007 Americas (2.5 )% 14.2 % Asia Pacific (1.6 ) 9.7 Europe (8.3 ) 13.8 Total (3.3 )% 11.8 % The following table sets forth information on revenue by segment as of June 30 (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Connector $ 1,879,443 $ 1,885,431 $ 1,721,459 Transportation 498,141 472,257 424,740 Custom Electrical 941,365 892,756 650,332 Corporate Other 9,398 15,430 64,758 Total $ 3,328,347 $ 3,265,874 $ 2,861,289 Gross Profit The following table provides summary of gross profit and gross margin compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Gross profit $ 1,014,235 $ 1,016,708 $ 942,630 Gross margin 30.5 % 31.1 % 32.9 % The reduction in gross margin was primarily due to higher commodity cost and price erosion partially offset by general cost reductions, a portion of which is related to restructuring activities. A significant portion of our material cost is comprised of copper and gold costs. We purchased approximately 25 million pounds of copper and approximately 135,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2008. The following table shows the increase in average prices related to our purchases of copper and gold: 2008 2007 2006 Copper (price per pound) $ 3.49 $ 3.20 $ 2.28 Gold (price per troy ounce) 825.00 636.00 525.00 30 Table of Contents Generally, we are able to pass through to our customers only a small a portion of the increased cost of copper and gold. However, we mitigated the impact of the increase in gold prices by hedging approximately 40% of our gold purchases in fiscal 2008. In addition to commodity costs, the increase (decrease) of certain other significant impacts on gross profit compared with the prior years was as follows as of June 30 (in thousands): 2008 2007 Price erosion $ (132,758 ) $ (131,435 ) Currency translation 48,842 12,595 Currency transaction (18,393 ) 18,166 The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Currency translation decreased gross margin by 10 basis points as revenue increased by $169.3 million, also due to the weaker dollar. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transaction losses in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended June 30, 2008 were as follows (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general administrative $ 665,038 $ 658,289 $ 606,532 Selling, general administrative as a percentage of revenue 20.0 % 20.1 % 21.1 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 31,247 36,869 26,354 Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 while organic net revenue declined. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $35.4 million for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $12.4 million for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net revenue in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a lower cost structure resulting from our restructuring initiative which began in fiscal 2007, lower incentive compensation expense in 2008 and 2007 and specific cost containment activities. Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, were 4.9% of net revenue for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. Restructuring costs and asset impairments During fiscal 2007, we undertook a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital as a result of a new global organization that was effective July 1, 2007. A majority of the plan relates to facilities located in North America and Europe and in general, the movement of manufacturing activities at these plants to other facilities. Net restructuring cost during the year ended June 30, 2008 was $31.2 million, resulting in cumulative costs since we announced the restructuring plan of $68.1 million. We have revised our initial estimate and now expect to incur total restructuring and asset impairment costs related to these actions ranging from $125 to $140 million, of which the impact on each segment will be determined as the actions become more certain. Management and the Board of Directors approved several actions related to this plan. A 31 Table of Contents portion of this plan involves cost savings or other actions that do not result in incremental expense, such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending and organizational efficiencies. This plan includes employee reduction targets throughout the company, and we expect to achieve these targets through ongoing employee attrition and terminations. We expect to substantially complete the actions under this plan by June 30, 2010. During fiscal 2008, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 900 employees, resulting in a charge of $17.6 million. A large part of these employee terminations occurred in our corporate headquarters and U.S. and Mexican manufacturing operations. In accordance with our planned restructuring actions, we have recorded additional asset impairment charges of $13.6 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. During fiscal 2007, we recognized additional restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 335 employees. A substantial majority of these employee terminations occurred within our Ireland manufacturing operations and various administrative functions in the Americas and European regions. In addition, we have vacated or plan to vacate several buildings and are holding these buildings and related assets for sale. This plan resulted in an impairment charge of $8.7 million to write down these assets to fair value less the cost to sell these assets. The fair value of the asset groupings was determined using various valuation techniques. During fiscal 2005, we decided to close certain operations in the Americas and European regions in order to reduce operating costs and better align our manufacturing capacity with customer needs. In the Americas region, we closed an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and have ceased manufacturing in our Detroit area automotive facility. In Europe, we closed certain manufacturing facilities in Ireland and Portugal and reduced the size of a development center in Germany. We also closed a manufacturing facility in Slovakia. Production from these manufacturing facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region. We also took actions that reduced our selling, general and administrative costs in the Americas and European regions and at the corporate office. We reduced headcount by approximately 500 people after additions at the facilities where production was transferred. These actions were substantially complete as of June 30, 2006. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for the three years ended June 30, 2008 was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Effective tax rate 36.4 % 28.8 % 28.0 % The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 increased due to adjustments to foreign tax credits, including (1) a change in estimate of $6.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, resulting from a difference between foreign tax credits estimated in our fiscal 2007 financial statements and subsequently reflected in our fiscal 2007 tax return, and (2) a fourth quarter charge of $10.9 million to correct errors in the prior years tax pools used to calculate foreign tax credit carryforwards. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 was substantially unchanged from fiscal 2006. Backlog Backlog as of the three years ended June 30 was as follows (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Backlog $ 436,487 $ 332,479 $ 369,966 32 Table of Contents Backlog at June 30, 2008 increased due to orders received in the telecommunications and data markets and foreign currency translation. Foreign currency translation increased the backlog by $25.7 million compared with June 30, 2007. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, backlog increased 23.6% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. Orders for fiscal 2008 were $3.4 billion compared with $3.2 billion for the prior year. Orders increased due to an increase in the telecommunications market and foreign currency translation. Foreign currency translation increased orders by $139.4 million. Backlog decreased as of June 30, 2007 compared with June 30, 2006, primarily due to a decrease in demand at the end of fiscal 2007, particularly in the mobile communications market, and an increase in vendor managed inventory programs to customers. Under the vendor managed inventory program, the order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. The decrease in backlog as of June 30, 2007 compared with 2006 was offset by the acquisition of Woodhead, which had backlog of $24.3 million on June 30, 2007. Connector The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2008 2007 Net revenue for prior year $ 1,885,431 $ 1,721,459 Components of net revenue increase (decrease): Organic net revenue (decline) growth (101,466 ) 130,530 Currency translation 95,478 33,442 Total change in net revenue from prior year (5,988 ) 163,972 Net revenue for current year $ 1,879,443 $ 1,885,431 Organic net revenue (decline) growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (5.4 )% 7.6 % The Connector segments core markets are telecommunication, data products and consumer, which are discussed above. Segment revenue decreased during fiscal 2008 with currency translation offsetting an organic revenue decline. Connector organic revenue decreased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to general weakness in these markets, particularly the mobile phone sector. Additionally, price erosion, which is generally higher in the Connector segment compared with our other segments, was 5.7% in fiscal 2008. Organic net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was a result of stronger demand in the consumer market with growth in both the satellite radio and games markets where we had significant connector content. The following table provides information on income from operations and operating margins for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Income from operations $ 302,240 $ 354,358 $ 411,329 Operating margin 16.1 % 18.8 % 23.9 % Connector segment income from operations decreased compared with the prior year periods due to lower organic revenue in fiscal 2008 and price erosion and higher raw material cost in fiscal 2008 and 2007. We passed on to customers only a small amount of the commodity cost increase. 33 Table of Contents Transportation The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2008 2007 Net revenue for prior year $ 472,257 $ 424,740 Components of net revenue increase (decrease): Organic net revenue (decline) growth (3,171 ) 39,565 Currency translation 29,055 7,952 Total change in net revenue from prior year 25,884 47,517 Net revenue for current year $ 498,141 $ 472,257 Organic net revenue (decline) growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (0.7 )% 9.3 % Transportation segment organic net revenue declined in fiscal 2008 but was offset entirely by foreign currency translation. Revenue was negatively impacted during the second half of fiscal 2008 due to a strike at a key supplier of one of our customers. The organic net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to new U.S. program wins and higher electronic content in vehicles. The following table provides information on income from operations and operating margins for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Income from operations $ 15,356 $ 7,476 $ (4,472 ) Operating margin 3.1 % 1.6 % (1.1 )% Segment operating income improved during the last three years due to higher gross margins resulting from cost reductions and more efficient use of capacity in connection with the restructuring activities that began in June 2007. Capacity utilization improved due to completion of the transition of manufacturing operations that was ongoing during the first half of fiscal 2007. Custom Electrical The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2008 2007 Net revenue for prior year $ 892,756 $ 650,332 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue growth 4,455 16,292 Currency translation 44,154 23,653 Acquisitions 202,479 Total change in net revenue from prior year 48,609 242,424 Net revenue for current year $ 941,365 $ 892,756 Organic net revenue growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 0.5 % 2.5 % The Custom and Electrical segments core markets are industrial, telecommunications and data, which are discussed above. Higher revenue from telecommunications infrastructure products was offset by lower revenue in the industrial market. Organic net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was realized in both the industrial and telecommunications markets. 34 Table of Contents The following table provides information on income from operations and operating margins for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Income from operations $ 94,076 $ 52,898 $ 29,047 Operating margin 10.0 % 5.9 % 4.5 % Segment operating income increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to efficiencies achieved with the Woodhead integration and an increase in revenue in the telecommunications market. Operating income increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to higher revenue attributed to the Woodhead acquisition. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net revenue growth, which is included in the discussion above, is a non GAAP financial measure. The tables presented in Results of Operations above provide reconciliations of U.S. GAAP reported net revenue growth (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to organic net revenue growth. We believe organic net revenue growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net revenue growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition activity. Management uses organic net revenue growth together with GAAP measures such as net revenue growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position remains strong and we continue to be able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $509.8 million and $460.9 million at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of which approximately $480.0 was in non U.S. accounts as of June 30, 2008. Transferring cash, cash equivalent or marketable securities to U.S. accounts from non U.S. accounts could subject us to additional U.S. repatriation income tax. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Management believes that our liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current and future growth. We have historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists. Long term debt and obligations under capital leases at June 30, 2008 totaled $151.8 million. We have available lines of credit totaling $207.9 million at June 30, 2008. Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Cash provided from operating activities $ 479,134 $ 451,434 $ 443,856 Cash used for investing activities (218,156 ) (446,129 ) (240,779 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities (197,306 ) 28,529 (189,814 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 33,474 11,712 9,796 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 97,146 $ 45,546 $ 23,059 35 Table of Contents Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2008 increased by $27.7 million for fiscal 2008 from the prior year due mainly to lower use of funds to finance working capital needs in the current year period compared with the prior year, partially offset by lower net income. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Cash provided from operating activities increased by $7.6 million for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal 2006 offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase was primarily due to the revenue growth for fiscal 2007 compared with the prior year. Investing Activities On July 19, 2007, we completed an acquisition of a U.S. based company in an all cash transaction approximating $42.5 million. On August 9, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Woodhead in an all cash transaction for approximately $238.1 million, including the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures declined $62.2 million during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 reflecting our efforts to increase asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth. Capital expenditures increased $20.1 million for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 in order to provide increased capability in the Americas, Asia Pacific and European regions. Cash flow from investing activities also includes proceeds from marketable securities in the net amount of $46.8 million in fiscal 2008, $71.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $37.3 million in fiscal 2006. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities In order to fund the cash portion of our investment in Woodhead made during fiscal 2007, we entered into two term notes aggregating 15 billion Japanese yen ($141.3 million) and borrowed $44.0 million on our unsecured revolving credit line that was repaid the same year. The term notes are due in September 2009, with weighted average fixed interest rates approximating 1.3%. In order to fund stock repurchases during fiscal 2008, we borrowed $125.0 million on our unsecured revolving line of credit, $75.0 million of which was repaid during fiscal 2008. We purchased shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock totaling 8.0 million shares, 1.2 million shares and 6.0 million shares during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The aggregate cost of these purchases was $199.6 million, $34.9 million and $165.3 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2008. Substantially all funds were used under the authorization as of June 30, 2008. On August 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to an aggregate $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009. We have sufficient cash balances and cash flow to support our planned growth. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may impact our cash requirements and debt balances. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2008, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 39,831 $ 13,774 $ 11,797 $ 8,757 $ 5,503 Capital lease obligations 5,118 2,858 2,212 47 1 Other long term liabilities 17,798 4,673 3,930 626 8,569 Debt obligations 147,626 1,398 145,668 488 72 Total(1) $ 210,373 $ 22,703 $ 163,607 $ 9,918 $ 14,145 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Debt and capital lease obligations include interest payments. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (iv) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. 37 Table of Contents We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2008 and 2007. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $169.3 million and increased income from operations of $12.5 million for 2008, compared with the estimated results for 2007 using the average rates for 2007. Our $34.3 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2008 are principally invested in time deposits. Interest rate exposure is limited to our long term debt. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments (less than 12 months) and the fixed rate nature of our long term debt. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 38
