Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of Molex, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward looking statements included at the end of this discussion, under the caption Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All references to fiscal years relate to the fiscal year ended June 30. Overview Our Business Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electronic components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 different products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, data, consumer products, industrial and automotive markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and flat panel display televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. We believe that our sales mix has growth prospects in each of our product markets. Net revenue by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and changes in their revenue levels and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce. The following table sets forth, for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by primary product markets. Percentage of Net Revenue 2009 2008 2007 Telecommunication 26 % 25 % 25 % Data 21 20 20 Consumer 21 20 20 Industrial 15 16 18 Automotive 14 17 16 Other 3 2 1 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 24 In fiscal 2009, we reclassified our net revenue by market to reflect our current estimate of how revenue to distributors and contract manufacturers reach the end market. Previously reported net revenue by market for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was reclassified to reflect this change. The following table sets forth, for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by geographic region: 2009 2008 2007 Americas 26.9 % 27.6 % 28.7 % Asia Pacific 54.4 52.0 51.1 Europe 18.7 20.4 20.2 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The following table sets forth, for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by reporting segment: 2009 2008 2007 Connector 69.3 % 71.4 % 72.2 % Custom Electrical 30.6 28.3 27.3 Corporate Other 0.1 0.3 0.5 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors worldwide. Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. As of June 30, 2009, we operated 43 manufacturing locations, located in 18 countries throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In fiscal 2009, 54.4% of our revenue was derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region. We expect greater economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, than in the Americas and Europe. We continue to move our manufacturing operations from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. Approximately 52% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced our need to duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, our strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world. We believe that our business is positioned to benefit from this strategy. Business Environment The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are one of the worlds largest manufacturers of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. Our financial results are influenced by factors in the markets in which we operate and by our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. Marketplace factors include competition for customers, raw material prices, product and price competition, economic conditions in various geographic regions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, fluctuations in customer demand, patent and intellectual property issues, litigation results and legal and regulatory developments. We expect that the marketplace environment will remain highly competitive. Our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges, including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate manufacturing to 25 such demand, manage rising raw material costs, develop, manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines, control operating costs, and attract, motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational, financial and management information systems. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net revenue growth, which is included in Managements Discussion Analysis, is a non GAAP financial measure. The tables presented in Results of Operations above provide reconciliations of U.S. GAAP reported net revenue growth (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to organic net revenue growth. We believe organic net revenue growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net revenue growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition activity. Management uses organic net revenue growth together with GAAP measures such as net revenue growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. Because organic net revenue growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similar measures of other companies. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2009 of $2.6 billion decreased 22.4% from fiscal 2008. Organic net revenue declined 23.1% in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008. We recognized a net loss of $321.3 million in fiscal 2009 compared with net income of $215.4 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 results include goodwill impairment charges of $264.1 million and restructuring costs of $131.3 million ($99.0 million after tax), and intangible asset impairment costs of $16.3 million. Restructuring charges of $31.2 million ($21.0 million after tax) were recorded in fiscal 2008. On June 25, 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility with an outstanding balance of $25.0 million as of June 30, 2009, which was used to pay down other unsecured debt balances. 26 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue (dollars in thousands): Percentage of Percentage of Percentage of 2009 Revenue 2008 Revenue 2007 Revenue Net revenue $ 2,581,841 100.0 % $ 3,328,347 100.0 % $ 3,265,874 100.0 % Cost of sales 1,925,664 74.6 % 2,314,112 69.5 % 2,249,166 68.9 % Gross profit 656,177 25.4 % 1,014,235 30.5 % 1,016,708 31.1 % Selling, general administrative 586,702 22.7 % 665,038 20.0 % 658,289 20.1 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 151,531 5.9 % 31,247 0.9 % 36,869 1.1 % Goodwill impairments 264,140 10.2 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Income (loss) from operations (346,196 ) (13.4 )% 317,950 9.6 % 321,550 9.9 % Other income, net 27,308 1.0 % 20,698 0.6 % 16,707 0.5 % Income (loss) before income taxes (318,888 ) (12.4 )% 338,648 10.2 % 338,257 10.4 % Income taxes 2,399 (0.0 )% 123,211 3.7 % 97,489 3.0 % Net (loss) income $ (321,287 ) (12.4 )% $ 215,437 6.5 % $ 240,768 7.4 % Net Revenue The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal years (in thousands): 2009 2008 Net revenue for prior year $ 3,328,347 $ 3,265,874 Components of net revenue (decrease) increase: Organic net revenue decline (769,296 ) (106,863 ) Currency translation 5,243 169,336 Acquisitions 17,547 Total change in net revenue from prior year (746,506 ) 62,473 Net revenue for current year $ 2,581,841 $ 3,328,347 Organic net revenue (decline) as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (23.1 )% (3.3 )% Revenue declined significantly during fiscal 2009 across all of the primary markets due to deterioration in global economic conditions starting in November 2008 and subsequent inventory reductions in the supply chain, which decreased demand for components and our production levels. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 was principally due to the strengthening Japanese yen. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2008 was principally due to the general weakening of the U.S. dollar 27 against other currencies. The following tables show the effect on the change in geographic net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar (in thousands): June 30, 2009 June 30, 2008 Local Currency Net Local Currency Net Currency Translation Change Currency Translation Change Americas $ (226,735 ) $ (2,627 ) $ (229,362 ) $ (23,304 ) $ 3,637 $ (19,667 ) Asia Pacific (354,081 ) 27,594 (326,487 ) (26,974 ) 89,405 62,431 Europe (177,647 ) (19,724 ) (197,371 ) (54,735 ) 76,294 21,559 Corporate Other 6,714 6,714 (1,850 ) (1,850 ) Net change $ (751,749 ) $ 5,243 $ (746,506 ) $ (106,863 ) $ 169,336 $ 62,473 The change in revenue on a local currency basis as of June 30 was as follows: 2009 2008 Americas (24.7 )% (2.5 )% Asia Pacific (20.5 ) (1.6 ) Europe (26.1 ) (8.3 ) Total (22.6 )% (3.3 )% We sell our products in five primary markets. The decline in organic revenue due to poor global economic conditions has impacted all of our market areas. Of our five primary markets, the automotive market has experienced the sharpest decline in demand during fiscal 2009 as consumers are not purchasing as many new automobiles in the current economic environment. Concerns about the global economy have also impacted our industrial market and telecommunications market for mobile devices as demand continues to be lower than in fiscal 2008. The following table sets forth, for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, changes in net revenue from each of our five primary product markets from the prior fiscal year: 2009 2008 Telecommunications (18 )% 3 % Consumer (18 ) 2 Data (18 ) 4 Industrial (27 ) (7 ) Automotive (35 ) 6 Telecommunications market revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower demand for mobile products and supply chain inventory reductions. This decline is partially offset by higher demand for smartphones and our customers introduction of new smartphone models, many of which include our connector and antenna products. Telecommunications market revenue increased in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 due to higher demand for our networking products. Consumer market revenue decreased in home entertainment and home appliance products in fiscal 2009. These declines were partially offset by increased demand for our products used in electronic gaming equipment. Demand increased in fiscal 2009 for our components in portable navigation devices and flat panel display televisions, although the increased demand in flat panel display televisions was offset by cost pressures and price erosion. Consumer market revenue increased in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 due to higher demand for our connectors used in home entertainment products. Data market revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased from 2008 due to lower customer demand for storage networking products and computer peripherals due to the global economic uncertainties. These declines were partially offset by increased demand due to our customers release of lower end computers and notebook computers. Data market revenue increased in fiscal 2008 compared with 28 2007 due to our customers releases of new high end products and their expansion in new optical and high speed technologies, for which we offered a strong product line. The industrial market revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased compared with 2008 due to declines in residential and commercial construction, lower demand in the industrial communications business worldwide, particularly in North America and Europe, and lower demand for factory automation due to worldwide excess manufacturing capacity. Declines in non residential, commercial and industrial construction had a negative impact on temporary power and lighting products used on jobsites. The global decline in the manufacturing economy resulted in the delay or cancellation of many industrial automation projects. The industrial market declined in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 due largely to our customer enhancing its product line for a cable assembly product. Automotive market revenue declined in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decrease in demand related to poor economic conditions during fiscal 2009. The number of automobiles manufactured by our customers decreased in fiscal 2009 as automotive manufacturing companies reduced inventories in the automotive supply chain. There were a number of extended closings and bankruptcy filings by automotive manufacturers and automotive suppliers during fiscal 2009 that negatively impacted our revenue. The automobile market began to show signs of stabilization late in fiscal 2009 as new car sales increased in Western Europe due to government incentives. Revenue in the U.S. automotive market was higher in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 as the automotive market benefited from new products reflecting higher electronic content in automobiles. Gross Profit We measure gross profit as net revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, such as materials, direct and indirect labor, and factory overhead, as well as all of the costs of our customer service function such as labor, materials, travel and overhead. Our gross margins are primarily affected by the following drivers: product mix; volume; cost reduction efforts; competitive pricing pressure; commodity costs; and currency fluctuations. The following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Gross profit $ 656,177 $ 1,014,235 $ 1,016,708 Gross margin 25.4 % 30.5 % 31.1 % The reduction in gross margin during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to lower absorption from the rapid drop in our production caused by the poor global economic conditions. While we were unable to reduce factory related costs as quickly as production declined, the expansion of our restructuring program should improve our gross margins over time. The reduction in gross margin in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily related to higher commodity cost and price erosion partially offset by general cost reductions, a portion of which is related to restructuring activities. A significant portion of our material cost consists of copper and gold costs. We purchased approximately 16 million pounds of copper and approximately 87,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2009 compared with approximately 25 million pounds of copper and approximately 135,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2008 and 2007. The following table sets forth the average prices of copper and gold we purchased in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Average Price Copper (price per pound) $ 2.69 $ 3.49 $ 3.20 Gold (price per troy ounce) 872.00 825.00 636.00 Generally, we are able to pass through to our customers only a small a portion of the changes in the cost of copper and gold. However, we mitigated the impact of the change in copper and gold 29 prices by hedging with call options a portion of our projected net global purchases of copper and gold. The hedges did not materially affect operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008. In addition to commodity costs, the following table sets forth, for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the effects of certain significant impacts on gross profit from the prior year (in thousands): 2009 2008 Price erosion $ (97,643 ) $ (132,758 ) Currency translation 4,590 48,842 Currency transaction (14,382 ) (18,393 ) Price erosion is measured as the reduction in prices of our products year over year, which reduces our gross profit. A significant portion of the price erosion occurred in our mobile phone connector products, which are part of our telecommunications market. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen against other currencies, partially offset by a general strengthening U.S. dollar against other currencies. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen, partially offset by a weaker euro against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transaction losses in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general administrative $ 586,702 $ 665,038 $ 658,289 Selling, general administrative as a percentage of revenue 22.7 % 20.0 % 20.1 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 151,531 31,247 36,869 Goodwill impairments 264,140 Selling, general administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with prior year periods primarily due to the significant drop in revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined by $78.3 million or 11.8% primarily due to our restructuring efforts and cost cutting initiatives in response to the significant drop in revenue. These initiatives included salary reductions and a $9.1 million decrease in expense related to reductions in employee benefits. We also reduced selling, general and administrative expenses through a lower cost structure resulting from our restructuring initiative and specific cost containment activities. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 while organic net revenue declined. The impact of currency translation decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $4.1 million for fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $35.4 million for fiscal 2008 compared with 2007. 30 Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, was $159.2 million, or 6.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009 compared with $163.7 million, or 4.9% of net revenue, for fiscal 2008 and $159.1 million, or 4.9% of net revenue, for fiscal 2007. The increase in expense as a percent of revenue is primarily due to the drop in revenue in fiscal 2009. Total research and development expenditures in fiscal 2009 were consistent with fiscal 2008, but increased as a percent of net revenue. Restructuring costs and asset impairments Restructuring costs and asset impairments consist of the following (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Total Severance costs $ 110,155 $ 17,648 $ 26,702 $ 154,505 Asset impairments 21,128 13,599 8,667 43,394 Restructuring costs 131,283 31,247 35,369 197,899 Intangible asset impairments 16,300 16,300 Other charges 3,948 1,500 5,448 Total restructuring charges and asset impairments $ 151,531 $ 31,247 $ 36,869 $ 219,647 During fiscal 2007, we undertook a multi year restructuring plan designed to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and to improve customer service and return on invested capital in connection with a new global organization that was effective July 1, 2007. A majority of the plan relates to facilities located in North America, Europe and Japan and, in general, the movement of manufacturing activities at these plants to other lower cost facilities. Restructuring costs during fiscal 2009 was $131.3 million, consisting of $110.2 million of severance costs and $21.1 million for asset impairments. The cumulative expense since we announced the restructuring plan totals $197.9 million. We expect to incur total restructuring and asset impairment costs related to these actions ranging from $240 to $250 million, of which the impact on each segment will be determined as the actions become more certain. Management approved several actions related to this plan. The total cost estimates increased as we formulated detailed plans for the latest restructuring actions, which included a reduction from five product focused divisions to three product focused divisions. A portion of this plan involves cost savings or other actions that do not result in incremental expense, such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending and organizational efficiencies. This plan includes employee reduction targets throughout the company, and we expect to achieve these targets through ongoing employee attrition and terminations. We expect to complete the actions under this plan by June 30, 2010 with estimated annual cost savings ranging from $190 to $210 million. In 2009, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,600 employees, resulting in a charge of $110.1 million. A large part of these employee terminations resulted from plant closings in Europe and Asia. We recognized asset impairment charges of $41.4 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. Restructuring costs and asset impairments in fiscal 2009 include intangible asset impairments of $16.3 million due to lower projected future revenue and profit in our Transportation and Automation Electrical business units. In 2008, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 900 employees, resulting in a charge of $17.6 million. A large part of these employee terminations occurred in our corporate headquarters and U.S. and Mexican manufacturing operations. In accordance with our planned restructuring actions, we recorded additional asset impairment charges of $13.6 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. In 2007, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 335 employees. A substantial majority of these employee terminations occurred within our Ireland manufacturing operations and various administrative functions in the 31 Americas and European regions. In addition, we have vacated or plan to vacate several buildings and are holding these buildings and related assets for sale. This plan resulted in an impairment charge of $8.7 million to write down these assets to fair value less the cost to sell these assets. The fair value of the asset groupings was determined using various valuation techniques. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $16.3 million to our indefinite lived intangible assets on lower projected future revenue and profit growth in the Automation Electrical business unit of our Custom Electrical segment. Goodwill Fiscal 2009 income from operations included goodwill impairment charges of $264.1 million. We recorded $93.1 million and $171.0 million goodwill impairment charges in the Transportation business unit of our Connector segment and Automation Electrical business unit of our Custom Electrical segment, respectively. The economic downturn had a negative impact on the business units operating results. The potential liquidity risk extended our estimate for the automotive industrys economic recovery and our Automation Electrical business units results were not recovering in line with other business units. These factors resulted in lower growth and profit expectations for these business units, which resulted in the goodwill impairment charges. Other Income (net) Other income consists primarily of net interest income, investment income and currency exchange gains or losses. Currency exchange gains for fiscal 2009 were $11.8 million. The increase in currency exchange gains in fiscal 2009 was due to a stronger U.S. dollar and Japanese yen against most other currencies. Prior to fiscal 2009, currency gains and losses were classified as selling, general and administrative expense. We recognized a $9.3 million and $6.7 million exchange losses in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for the three years ended June 30, was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Effective tax rate (0.8 )% 36.4 % 28.8 % The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was negative due to (1) a second quarter charge of $93.1 million to impair goodwill for which no tax benefit is available, (2) a fourth quarter charge of $171.0 million to impair goodwill for which no tax benefit is available, (3) increases in tax reserves based on evaluation of certain tax positions taken, and (4) tax losses generated in non US jurisdictions for which no tax benefit has been recognized. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was higher than fiscal 2007 due to changes in foreign tax credit estimates and carryforwards. Results by Product Segment During fiscal 2009, we reorganized our operations, which changed the configuration of our reportable segments into the Connector and Custom Electrical segments. Our former Transportation segment was operationally merged into the Connector segment under the direction of one global Executive Vice President. 32 Connector. The following table sets forth the change in net revenue for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2008 Net revenue for prior year $ 2,377,584 $ 2,357,688 Components of net revenue increase (decrease): Organic net revenue decline (614,321 ) (104,637 ) Currency translation 18,572 124,533 Acquisitions 7,304 Total change in net revenue from prior year (588,445 ) 19,896 Net revenue for current year $ 1,789,139 $ 2,377,584 Organic net revenue decline as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (25.8 )% (5.4 )% The Connector segment sells primarily to the telecommunications, data, automotive and consumer markets, which are discussed above. Segment revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 with currency translation partially offsetting an organic revenue decline. Connector organic revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the significant drop in consumer spending in the current economic conditions, particularly the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market and the automotive market. Connector organic revenue decreased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to general weakness in these markets, particularly the mobile phone sector. Additionally, price erosion, which is generally higher in the Connector segment compared with our other segments, was 4.6% and 5.7% in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also completed an asset purchase of a company in Japan during fiscal 2009. The following table sets forth information on income from operations and operating margins for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Income (loss) from operations $ (125,604 ) $ 322,226 $ 365,654 Operating margin (7.0 )% 17.1 % 19.4 % Connector segment income from operations decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year periods due to the decrease in revenue and a goodwill impairment charge. Fiscal 2009 income from operations was unfavorably impacted by restructuring charges of $93.9 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $93.1 million in our Transportation business unit due to lower projected future revenue and profit. The sharp decline was partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative expenses against the prior year periods. Custom Electrical. The following table sets forth net revenue for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2008 Net revenue for prior year $ 941,365 $ 892,756 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue (decline) growth (147,648 ) 4,455 Currency translation (13,359 ) 44,154 Acquisition 10,243 Total change in net revenue from prior year (150,764 ) 48,609 Net revenue for current year $ 790,601 $ 941,365 Organic net revenue (decline) growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (15.7 )% 0.5 % 33 The sale of Custom and Electrical segments products is concentrated in the industrial, telecommunications and data markets. Custom and Electrical segment revenue declined in fiscal 2009 due to the decline in these markets discussed above. We also acquired a flexible circuit manufacturing business during fiscal 2009. The following table sets forth income from operations and operating margins for the fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Income (loss) from operations $ (152,443 ) $ 97,393 $ 54,955 Operating margin (19.3 )% 10.3 % 6.2 % Segment operating income decreased in fiscal 2009 from prior years due to slowing global demand and impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets. Fiscal 2009 income from operations was unfavorably impacted by restructuring charges of $23.0 million, and a goodwill impairment charge of $171.0 million and intangible asset impairment charge of $16.3 million in our Automation Electrical business unit due to lower projected future revenue and profit. Demand in our Automation Electrical business unit declined significantly due to our customers global excess manufacturing capacity. Segment operating income increased in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007 due to efficiencies achieved with the Woodhead integration and an increase in revenue in the telecommunications market. Financial Condition and Liquidity We fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $467.9 million and $509.8 million at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which approximately $457.4 million was in non U.S. accounts as of June 30, 2009. Transferring cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities to U.S. accounts from non U.S. accounts could subject us to additional U.S. income tax. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Long term debt and obligations under capital leases totaled $242.1 million and $151.8 million at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We had available lines of credit totaling $282.5 million at June 30, 2009, including a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility with $170.0 million available as of June 30, 2009. Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided from operating activities $ 369,898 $ 479,134 $ 451,434 Cash used for investing activities (253,086 ) (218,156 ) (446,129 ) Cash (used for) provided by financing activities (155,582 ) (197,306 ) 28,529 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (12,030 ) 33,474 11,712 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (50,800 ) $ 97,146 $ 45,546 Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2009 decreased by $109.2 million from the prior year due mainly to lower revenue and income, partially offset by a related decline in working capital needs in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Net income in fiscal 2009 included non cash impairment charges approximating $308.0 million. Our restructuring accrual as of June 30, 2009 was $69.9 million, which we expect to 34 reduce through cash outlays during fiscal 2010 and 2011. In addition, we anticipate additional cash outlays of approximately $30.0 million during fiscal 2010 and 2011 related to restructuring charges that we expect to recognize in fiscal 2010. Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2008 increased by $27.7 million from fiscal 2007 due primarily to lower use of funds to finance working capital needs in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, partially offset by lower net income. Investing Activities During fiscal 2009, we completed the acquisition of two companies and a joint venture in cash transactions approximating $74.8 million. We recorded additional goodwill of $27.9 million in connection with the acquisitions. The purchase price allocation for the acquisitions is substantially complete. On July 19, 2007, we completed an acquisition of a U.S. based company in an all cash transaction approximating $42.5 million. On August 9, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Woodhead in an all cash transaction for approximately $238.1 million, including the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures declined $56.7 million and $62.2 million during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, compared with prior year periods. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects our efforts to increase asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth. Cash flow from investing activities also includes net purchases of marketable securities of $13.2 million in fiscal 2009, and proceeds in the amount of $46.8 million in fiscal 2008 and $71.2 million in fiscal 2007. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities On June 25, 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility. Borrowings were $25.0 million as of June 30, 2009, which was used to pay down other uncommitted debt balances. On August 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009. We purchased shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock totaling 4.5 million shares, 8.0 million shares and 1.2 million shares during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The aggregate cost of these purchases was $76.3 million, $199.6 million and $34.9 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In order to fund stock repurchases during fiscal 2008, we borrowed $125.0 million on our unsecured lines of credit, $75.0 million of which was repaid during fiscal 2008. In order to fund the cash portion of our investment in Woodhead made during fiscal 2007, we entered into two term notes aggregating 15 billion Japanese yen ($141.3 million) and borrowed $44.0 million on our unsecured lines of credit that was repaid the same year. The term notes are due in September 2009, with weighted average fixed interest rates approximating 1.3%. We plan to refinance the term notes upon their expiration in September 2009. Sources of Liquidity We believe we have sufficient cash balances and cash flow to support our planned growth. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may affect our cash requirements and debt balances. 35 We had available lines of credit totaling $307.5 million at June 30, 2009 expiring between 2009 and 2013. On June 25, 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility with interest rates equivalent to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus 250 basis points. The revolving line of credit also includes an accordion feature allowing us to increase the balance of the credit line by an amount not to exceed $75.0 million. The current portion of our long term debt as of June 30, 2009 consists principally of three unsecured term loans approximating 20 billion Japanese yen ($208.0 million) due in September 2009, with weighted average fixed interest rates approximating 1.3%. We plan to refinance the term notes upon their expiration in September 2009. Our long term debt approximates $30.3 million, including an outstanding balance of $25.0 million on the revolving credit line at June 30, 2009. Our remaining long term debt generally consists of mortgages and industrial development bonds with interest rates ranging from 5.9% to 7.8% and maturing through 2013. Certain assets, including land, buildings and equipment, secure our long term debt. Principal payments on long term debt obligations, including interest, are due as follows: fiscal 2010, $208.9 million; fiscal 2011, $3.9 million; fiscal 2012, $25.6 million; fiscal 2013, $0.6 million; and thereafter, $0.1 million. The instrument governing our credit facility contains customary covenants regarding liens, debt, substantial asset sales and mergers, dividends and investments. Our credit facility also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage, fixed charge coverage and liquidity. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2009, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 33,648 $ 12,367 $ 14,294 $ 3,722 $ 3,265 Capital lease obligations 3,108 2,060 1,046 2 Other long term liabilities 14,512 3,520 1,335 239 9,418 Debt obligations 238,946 208,635 30,279 32 Total(1) $ 290,214 $ 226,582 $ 46,954 $ 3,995 $ 12,683 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Debt and capital lease obligations include interest payments. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. 36 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (i) made guarantees, (ii) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (iv) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Income Taxes As a result of the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) interpretation No. 48, Accounting for the Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), effective July 1, 2007, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. 37 Prior to adoption of FIN 48, our policy was to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We established the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $117.3 million at June 30, 2009. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $70 million at June 30, 2009. Entities with net operating losses were able to utilize $0.3 million of these losses during fiscal 2009. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the pension benefit obligation (PBO), are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The discount rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each years expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for U.S. pension obligations. The discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by using a yield curve approach or by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets. In those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These 38 key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2009, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (4,024 ) $ (8,534 ) $ (279 ) $ (132 ) Decrease 50 basis points 4,491 9,649 287 141 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A (600 ) (723 ) Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A 600 723 Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in the discount rate assumption for our retiree healthcare plans as of June 30, 1009, assuming no change in benefit levels is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Total Annual Service Increase (Decrease) and Interest Cost in APBO Increase 100 basis points: $ 708 $ 4,882 Decrease 100 basis points: (588 ) (4,095 ) Stock Options We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock. We estimate the expected life of the option using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to the disclosure requirements of SFAS 157 as of June 30, 2009 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Total Markets for Other Significant Measured Identical Observable Unobservable at Fair Assets Inputs Inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale and trading securities $ 52,401 $ 52,401 $ $ Derivative financial instruments, net 2,601 2,601 Total $ 55,002 $ 52,401 $ 2,601 $ 39 We determine the fair value of our available for sale securities based on quoted market prices (Level 1). We generally use derivatives for hedging purposes pursuant to SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 149, which are valued based on Level 2 inputs in the SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our financial instruments is determined by a mark to market valuation based on forward curves using observable market prices. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are generally based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs and Asset Impairments We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. We recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are expensed and accrued when it is determined that a liability is probable, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized upon approval of a restructuring plan by management or in future accounting periods when terminated employees continue to provide service. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) For available for sale securities, we presume an OTTI decline in value if the quoted market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a continuous period of six months or more. However, the presumption of an OTTI decline in value may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature. For investments accounted for 40 under the equity method, we evaluate all known quantitative and qualitative factors in addition to quoted market prices in determining whether an OTTI decline in value exists. Factors that we consider important in evaluating for a potential OTTI, include historical operating performance, future financial projections, business plans for new products or concepts and strength of balance sheet. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R states that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred with restructuring costs being expensed in periods after the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states that business combinations will result in all assets and liabilities of the acquired business being recorded at their fair values. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 141R effective July 1, 2009. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will depend on the nature and extent of business combinations occurring on or after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160) an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 requires identification and presentation of ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than us in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the equity. It also requires that (1) the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, (2) changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions, and (3) when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. This statement is effective for us on July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 160, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. This statement is effective for us on July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161) an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thus improves the transparency of financial reporting. This statement is effective for us on July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 161, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FAS 132R 1). FAS 132R 1 requires disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This statement is effective for us on 41 July 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 132R 1 will result in enhanced disclosures, but will not otherwise have an impact on our financial statements. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K and other documents we file with the Commission contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs, and our managements assumptions. Words such as expect, anticipate, outlook, forecast, could, project, intend, plan, continue, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations below. We have based our forward looking statements on our managements beliefs and assumptions based on information available to them at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding growth strategies, industry trends, financial results, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, acquisition synergies, manufacturing strategies, product development and sales, regulatory approvals, and competitive strengths. Except as required under the federal securities laws, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the filing of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2009 and 2008. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into 42 U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $5.2 million and increased income from operations of $1.7 million for 2009, compared with the estimated results for 2008 using the average rates for 2008. Our $43.2 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2009 are principally invested in time deposits. Interest rate exposure is limited to our long term debt. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. However, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments (less than 12 months) and the fixed rate nature of our long term debt. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 43
