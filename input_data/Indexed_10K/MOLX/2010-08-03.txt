Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of Molex, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward looking statements included under Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All references to fiscal years relate to the fiscal year ended June 30. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we made the following adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a liability for potential losses related to the unauthorized activities in Japan. We are restating prior period financial statements to record liabilities in the periods in which the unauthorized transactions occurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed a study to determine if historical tax transactions and balances had been recognized appropriately in accordance with ASC 740. We identified errors in tax related accounts in prior periods. Overview Our Business Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electronic components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 different products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. We sell our products in five primary markets. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, data, consumer, industrial and automotive markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and flat panel display televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. We believe that our sales mix has growth prospects in each of our product markets. Net revenue by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and changes in their revenue levels and new products or model changes 26 that we or our customers introduce. The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by primary markets.

Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. As of June 30, 2010, we operated 39 manufacturing locations, located in 16 countries throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In fiscal 2010, 59.8% of our net revenue was derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region. We expect greater economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, than in the Americas and Europe. We continue to move our manufacturing operations from the United States and Western Europe to lower cost regions. Approximately 58% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. In addition, reduced trade barriers, lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced our need to duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, our strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations. We believe that our business is positioned to benefit from this strategy. Business Environment The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are one of the worlds largest manufacturers of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers 27 globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. Our financial results are influenced by factors in the markets in which we operate and by our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. Marketplace factors include competition for customers, raw material prices, product and price competition, economic conditions in various geographic regions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, fluctuations in customer demand, patent and intellectual property issues, litigation results and legal and regulatory developments. We expect that the marketplace environment will remain highly competitive. Our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges, including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate manufacturing to such demand, manage rising raw material costs, develop, manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines, control operating costs, and attract, motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational, financial and management information systems. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net revenue growth, which is included in Managements Discussion Analysis, is a non GAAP financial measure. The tables presented in Results of Operations above provide reconciliations of U.S. GAAP reported net revenue growth (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to organic net revenue growth. We believe organic net revenue growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net revenue growth to monitor and evaluate performance, since it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition activity. Management uses organic net revenue growth together with GAAP measures such as net revenue and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. Because organic net revenue growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similar measures of other companies. Net Loss on Unauthorized Activities in Japan As we previously reported, in April 2010, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in Japan. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japans finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japans name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japans name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japans accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation is now substantially complete. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported the outstanding unauthorized loans as a contingent liability of $162.2 million. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters. In particular, we recorded cumulative net losses of $201.9 million, ($128.7 million after tax) due to these unauthorized activities (see Note 3), which were comprised of (1) the asserted unauthorized loans outstanding as of June 30, 2010 of 28 15.0 billion ($169.7 million), (2) the payment of 1.0 billion ($10.8 million) of unauthorized loans on April 5, 2010, (3) misappropriated funds of 1.9 billion ($20.5 million), and (4) cumulative investigative costs through June 30, 2010 of $4.8 million, offset by (5) an unauthorized investment account with a balance of 0.4 billion ($3.9 million) as of June 30, 2010. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010, with approximately 15.4 billion ($167.4 million) occurring prior to June 30, 2007. The accrued liability for these potential net losses was 14.7 billion ($165.8 million) as of June 30, 2010. To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the outstanding unauthorized loans, we would recognize a gain in that amount. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2010 of $3.0 billion increased 16.5% from fiscal 2009. Organic net revenue increased 13.0% in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009. We recognized net income of $76.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared with net loss of $322.0 million in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 results include restructuring charges of $117.1 million ($92.8 million after tax) and net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan of $26.9 million ($17.1 million after tax). Fiscal 2009 results include goodwill impairment charges of $264.1 million and restructuring charges of $131.3 million ($99.0 million after tax), and intangible asset impairment costs of $16.3 million and net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan of $2.7 million. On June 25, 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility in the United States (the U.S. Credit Facility) with an outstanding balance of $100.0 million as of June 30, 2010, which was used to pay down other unsecured debt balances. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue (dollars in thousands): Percentage of Percentage of Percentage of 2010 Net Revenue 2009 Net Revenue 2008 Net Revenue (as restated) (as restated) Net revenue $ 3,007,207 100.0 % $ 2,581,841 100.0 % $ 3,328,347 100.0 % Cost of sales 2,114,584 70.3 % 1,925,664 74.6 % 2,314,112 69.5 % Gross profit 892,623 29.7 % 656,177 25.4 % 1,014,235 30.5 % Selling, general administrative 610,784 20.3 % 586,702 22.7 % 665,038 20.0 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 117,139 3.9 % 151,531 5.9 % 31,247 0.9 % Net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan 26,898 0.9 % 2,685 0.1 % 4,717 0.1 % Goodwill impairments 0.0 % 264,140 10.2 % 0.0 % Income (loss) from operations 137,802 4.6 % (348,881 ) (13.5 )% 313,233 9.4 % Other (expense) income, net (6,313 ) (0.2 )% 27,308 1.0 % 20,698 0.6 % Income (loss) before income taxes 131,489 4.4 % (321,573 ) (12.5 )% 333,931 10.0 % Income taxes 54,559 1.8 % 463 (0.0 )% 118,211 3.6 % Net income (loss) $ 76,930 2.6 % $ (322,036 ) (12.5 )% $ 215,720 6.5 % 29 Net Revenue The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal (in thousands): 2010 2009 Net revenue for prior year $ 2,581,841 $ 3,328,347 Components of net revenue increase (decrease): Organic net revenue increase (decline) 334,843 (769,296 ) Currency translation 60,236 5,243 Acquisitions 30,287 17,547 Total change in net revenue from prior year 425,366 (746,506 ) Net revenue for current year $ 3,007,207 $ 2,581,841 Organic net revenue increase (decline) as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 13.0 % (23.1 )% Net revenue increased during fiscal 2010 as customer demand improved in all of our primary markets compared to 2009 due to stabilizing economic conditions and customers replenishing inventory. Net revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 across all of our primary markets due to deterioration in global economic conditions and subsequent inventory reductions in the supply chain. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 was principally due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar against other currencies. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 was principally due to the strengthening Japanese yen. The following tables show the effect on the change in geographic net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar (in thousands): June 30, 2010 June 30, 2009 Local Currency Net Local Currency Net Currency Translation Change Currency Translation Change Americas $ 46,217 $ 1,384 $ 47,601 $ (226,735 ) $ (2,627 ) $ (229,362 ) Asia Pacific 336,195 58,199 394,394 (354,081 ) 27,594 (326,487 ) Europe (9,355 ) 653 (8,702 ) (177,647 ) (19,724 ) (197,371 ) Corporate Other (7,927 ) (7,927 ) 6,714 6,714 Net change $ 365,130 $ 60,236 $ 425,366 $ (751,749 ) $ 5,243 $ (746,506 ) The change in net revenue on a local currency basis as of June 30 follows: 2010 2009 Americas 6.7 % (24.7 )% Asia Pacific 42.3 (20.5 ) Europe (1.9 ) (26.1 ) Total 16.5 % (22.6 )% Net revenue increased across all five primary markets in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 as customer demand improved over the prior year. The decline in net revenue in fiscal 2009 due to decreased customer demand caused by the poor global economic conditions impacted all of our five primary markets. 30 The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2010 and 2009, changes in net revenue from each of our five primary product markets from the prior fiscal year: 2010 2009 Telecommunications 3 % (18 )% Consumer 25 (18 ) Data 21 (18 ) Industrial 13 (27 ) Automotive 26 (35 ) Telecommunications market net revenue increased in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 due to increased infrastructure spending, higher demand for smartphones and our customers introduction of smartphone models that include our connector products, partially offset by a decline in standard feature mobile phones. Telecommunications market net revenue declined in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower demand for mobile products and supply chain inventory reductions. Consumer market net revenue increased significantly in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 due to government incentives in certain countries, customers replenishing inventory levels and increased demand for our components in flat panel display televisions, digital cameras and home appliances. Consumer market net revenue declined in home entertainment and home appliance products in fiscal 2009. Demand increased in fiscal 2009 for our components in portable navigation devices and flat panel display televisions, although the increased demand in flat panel display televisions was offset by price erosion. Data market net revenue for fiscal 2010 increased significantly compared with 2009 because of depressed enterprise spending in the prior year and increased demand for notebooks, storage products, computers and accessories in the current year. Data market net revenue for fiscal 2009 declined from 2008 due to lower customer demand for storage networking products and computer peripherals due to the global economic uncertainties. Industrial market net revenue for fiscal 2010 increased compared with 2009 as global economic conditions improved over the prior year. Demand for industrial instruments and production equipment improved as our customers increased production to meet demand after delaying many industrial automation projects due to uncertainties about the economic conditions. Industrial market net revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased compared with 2008 due to declines in residential and commercial construction, lower demand in the industrial communications business worldwide, particularly in North America and Europe, and lower demand for factory automation due to worldwide excess manufacturing capacity. Declines in non residential, commercial and industrial construction had a negative impact on temporary power and lighting products used on jobsites. Automotive market net revenue for fiscal 2010 increased substantially compared with 2009 as global car sales have increased, particularly in North America, China and Europe, as improving global economic conditions led to our customers increasing vehicle builds to replenish inventory levels and meet demand. The automotive market also benefited from our customers increasing electronic content in automobiles, such as rear view cameras, navigational systems, mobile communication and entertainment systems. Automotive market net revenue declined in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decrease in demand related to poor economic conditions. The number of automobiles manufactured by our customers decreased in fiscal 2009 as automotive manufacturing companies reduced inventories in the automotive supply chain. There were a number of extended closings and bankruptcy filings by automotive manufacturers and automotive suppliers during fiscal 2009 that negatively impacted our net revenue. Gross Profit We measure gross profit as net revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, such as materials, direct and indirect labor, and factory overhead. Our gross margins are 31 primarily affected by the following factors: product mix; volume; cost reduction efforts; competitive pricing pressure; commodity costs; and currency fluctuations. The following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Gross profit $ 892,623 $ 656,177 $ 1,014,235 Gross margin 29.7 % 25.4 % 30.5 % The increase in gross margin during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher absorption from increased production and lower costs resulting from our restructuring program, which has improved margins over time. The improvements in gross profit were partially offset by the impact of price erosion, material price increases and increased delivery costs to meet the significant increase in demand. The reduction in gross margin during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to lower absorption from the rapid drop in our production caused by the poor global economic conditions. A significant portion of our material cost consists of copper and gold costs. We purchased approximately 23 million pounds of copper and approximately 112,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2010 compared with approximately 16 million pounds of copper and approximately 87,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2009 and 25 million pounds of copper and approximately 135,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2008. The following table sets forth the average prices of copper and gold we purchased in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Average Price Copper (price per pound) $ 3.04 $ 2.69 $ 3.49 Gold (price per troy ounce) 1,096.00 872.00 825.00 Generally, we are able to pass through to our customers only a small a portion of the changes in the cost of copper and gold. However, we mitigated the impact of the change in copper and gold prices by hedging with call options a portion of our projected net global purchases of copper and gold. The hedges did not materially affect operating results for fiscal 2010 and 2009. In addition to commodity costs, the following table sets forth, for fiscal 2010 and 2009, the effects of certain significant impacts on gross profit from the prior year (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Price erosion $ (124,787 ) $ (97,643 ) $ (132,758 ) Currency translation 23,928 4,590 48,842 Currency transaction (22,076 ) (14,382 ) (18,393 ) Price erosion is measured as the reduction in prices of our products year over year, which reduces our gross profit. A significant portion of the price erosion occurred in our mobile phone connector products, which are part of our telecommunications and consumer markets. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen against other currencies, partially offset by a general strengthening U.S. dollar against other currencies. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding 32 effect on net revenue. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transaction losses in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen, partially offset by a weaker euro against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general administrative $ 610,784 $ 586,702 $ 665,038 Selling, general administrative as a percentage of net revenue 20.3 % 22.7 % 20.0 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 117,139 151,531 31,247 Net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan 26,898 2,685 4,717 Goodwill impairments 264,140 Selling, general administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expense increased $24.1 million in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased headcount and certain employee benefits that were suspended during fiscal 2009, but were reinstated in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to our lower cost structure resulting from our restructuring efforts and specific cost containment activities. Selling, general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the significant drop in net revenue in fiscal 2009. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $13.7 million for fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $4.1 million for fiscal 2009 compared with 2008. Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, were $154.0 million, or 5.1% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010 compared with $159.2 million, or 6.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009 and $163.7 million, or 4.9% of net revenue, for fiscal 2008. The decrease in expense as a percent of net revenue is primarily due to the increase in net revenue in fiscal 2010 and efforts to contain cost. Total research and development expenditures in fiscal 2009 were consistent with fiscal 2008, but increased as a percent of net revenue primarily due to the sharp decrease in net revenue in fiscal 2009. Restructuring costs and asset impairments Restructuring costs and asset impairments consist of the following (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Severance costs $ 79,609 $ 110,155 $ 17,648 Asset impairments 37,296 21,128 13,599 Restructuring costs 116,905 131,283 31,247 Intangible asset impairments 234 16,300 Other charges 3,948 Total restructuring charges and asset impairments $ 117,139 $ 151,531 $ 31,247 33 During fiscal 2007, we undertook a multi year restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital in connection with a new global organization that was effective July 1, 2007. A majority of the plan related to facilities located in North America, Europe and Japan and, in general, the movement of manufacturing activities at these plants to other lower cost facilities. Restructuring costs during fiscal 2010 were $116.9 million, consisting of $79.6 million of severance costs and $37.3 million for asset impairments. The cumulative expense since we announced the restructuring plan totals $314.8 million. We completed our restructuring program on June 30, 2010 with estimated future annual cost savings of approximately $205 million. Management approved several actions related to this plan. The total cost estimates increased as we formulated detailed plans for the latest restructuring actions, which included a reduction from five product focused divisions to three product focused divisions. A portion of this plan involved cost savings or other actions that do not result in incremental expense, such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending and organizational efficiencies. This plan includes employee reduction targets throughout the company, and we expect to achieve these targets through ongoing employee attrition and terminations. In fiscal 2010, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 1,000 employees, resulting in a charge of $79.6 million. A large part of these employee terminations resulted from plant closings in Europe. We recognized asset impairment charges of $37.3 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. In fiscal 2009, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,600 employees, resulting in a charge of $110.1 million. A large part of these employee terminations resulted from plant closings in Europe and Asia. We recognized asset impairment charges of $41.4 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. Restructuring costs and asset impairments in fiscal 2009 included intangible asset impairments of $16.3 million due to lower projected future net revenue and profit in our Industrial business unit of our Custom Electrical segment. In fiscal 2008, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 900 employees, resulting in a charge of $17.6 million. A large part of these employee terminations occurred in our corporate headquarters and United States and Mexican manufacturing operations. In accordance with our planned restructuring actions, we recorded additional asset impairment charges of $13.6 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill We recorded no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2009 income from operations included goodwill impairment charges of $264.1 million. We recorded $93.1 million and $171.0 million goodwill impairment charges in the Transportation business unit of our Connector segment and Industrial business unit of our Custom Electrical segment, respectively. The economic downturn had a negative impact on the business units operating results. The potential liquidity risk extended our estimate for the automotive industrys economic recovery and our Industrial business units results were not recovering in line with other business units. These factors resulted in lower growth and profit expectations for these business units, which resulted in the goodwill impairment charges. Other (Expense) Income, net Other (expense) income consists primarily of net interest income, investment income and currency exchange gains or losses. Currency exchange losses for fiscal 2010 were $1.8 million due to 34 a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, partially offset by a stronger Japanese yen against most other currencies. Currency exchange gains in fiscal 2009 were $11.8 million due to a stronger U.S. dollar and Japanese yen against most other currencies. Prior to fiscal 2009, currency gains and losses were classified as selling, general and administrative expense. We recognized $9.3 million exchange losses in fiscal 2008. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended June 30, follows: 2010 2009 2008 (as restated) (as restated) Effective tax rate 41.5 % (0.1 )% 35.4 % The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher than prior years due to (1) income tax expense booked during the year of $7.7 million, due primarily to the reversal of an estimated tax benefit resulting from a significant number of employee stock options that expired unexercised, (2) a charge due to legislation passed during the year which includes a provision that reduces the deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of retiree prescription drug benefits to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, (3) tax losses generated in non U.S. jurisdictions for which no tax benefit has been recognized, and (4) additional U.S. tax cost to repatriate earning from non US subsidiaries during the year. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was (0.1%) due primarily to charges for goodwill impairments for which no tax benefit was available and increases in tax reserves based on evaluation of certain tax positions taken. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $206.7 million at June 30, 2010. Results by Product Segment We have two global product segments: Connector and Custom Electrical. The Connector segment designs and manufactures products for high speed, high density, high signal integrity applications as well as fine pitch, low profile connectors for the consumer and commercial markets. It also designs and manufactures products that withstand environments such as heat, cold, dust, dirt, liquid and vibration for automotive and other transportation applications. The Custom Electrical segment designs and manufactures integrated and customizable electronic components across all industries that provide original, differentiated solutions to customer requirements. It also leverages expertise in the use of signal, power and interface technology in industrial automation and other harsh environment applications. 35 Connector. The following table sets forth the change in net revenue for the Connector segment for fiscal 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 2010 2009 Net revenue for prior year $ 1,789,139 $ 2,377,584 Components of net revenue increase (decrease): Organic net revenue increase (decrease) 308,947 (614,321 ) Currency translation 54,224 18,572 Acquisitions 24,704 7,304 Total change in net revenue from prior year 387,875 (588,445 ) Net revenue for current year $ 2,177,014 $ 1,789,139 Organic net revenue increase (decrease) as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 17.3 % (25.8 )% The Connector segment sells primarily to the telecommunications, data, automotive and consumer markets, which are discussed above. Segment net revenue increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to increased demand in all of the Connector segments primary markets, partially offset by price erosion. Segment net revenue declined in fiscal 2009 with currency translation partially offsetting an organic net revenue decline. Connector segment organic net revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the significant drop in consumer spending in the current economic conditions, particularly the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market and the automotive market. Price erosion, which is generally higher in the Connector segment compared with our other segments, was 4.5% and 4.6% in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also completed an asset purchase of a company in Japan during fiscal 2009. The following table sets forth information on income from operations and operating margins for the Connector segment for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Income (loss) from operations $ 123,980 $ (125,604 ) $ 317,596 Operating margin 5.7 % (7.0 )% 13.4 % Connector segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased net revenue and the $93.1 million goodwill impairment charge during fiscal 2009 to write off goodwill based on lower projected future net revenue and profit growth in our Transportation business unit. Gross margins were positively affected by higher absorption and restructuring. Connector segment income from operations also improved due to lower selling, general and administrative costs in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $347.6 million, or 16.0% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010 compared with $365.5 million, or 20.5% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009, due to savings from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Income from operations was unfavorably impacted by restructuring costs of $100.3 million, $93.9 million and $14.5 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 36 Custom Electrical. The following table sets forth net revenue for fiscal 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 2010 2009 Net revenue for prior year $ 790,601 $ 941,365 Components of net revenue increase (decrease): Organic net revenue increase (decrease) growth 26,673 (147,648 ) Currency translation 6,048 (13,359 ) Acquisitions 5,583 10,243 Total change in net revenue from prior year 38,304 (150,764 ) Net revenue for current year $ 828,905 $ 790,601 Organic net revenue increase (decrease) growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 4.8 % (15.7 )% The sale of Custom Electrical segments products is concentrated in the industrial, telecommunications and data markets. Custom Electrical segment net revenue increased in fiscal 2010 due to the increased demand in all of the segments primary markets. Segment organic net revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 as demand declined significantly based on poor global economic conditions. We also completed an asset purchase of a company in China during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and acquired a flexible circuit manufacturing business in fiscal 2009. The following table sets forth income from operations and operating margins for the Custom Electrical segment for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Income (loss) from operations $ 111,083 $ (152,443 ) $ 94,076 Operating margin 13.4 % (19.3 )% 10.0 % Segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased net revenue, lower selling, general and administrative costs and the $171.0 million goodwill impairment charge and $16.3 million intangible asset charge during fiscal 2009 to write off goodwill and intangible assets in our Industrial business unit due to lower projected future net revenue and profit growth. Gross margins in fiscal 2010 were positively affected by higher absorption and restructuring. Custom Electrical segment income from operations also improved due to lower selling, general and administrative costs in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $168.5 million, or 20.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010 compared with $186.0 million, or 23.5% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009, due to savings from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Customer demand declined significantly in fiscal 2009 due to our customers global excess manufacturing capacity. Income from operations was unfavorably impacted by restructuring costs of $12.2 million, $39.3 million and $3.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Financial Condition and Liquidity We fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $394.9 million and $467.9 million at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which approximately $384.7 million was in non U.S. accounts as of June 30, 2010. Transferring cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities to U.S. accounts from non U.S. accounts could subject us to additional U.S. income tax. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. Total debt, including obligations under capital leases totaled $293.5 million and $254.7 million at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We had available lines of credit totaling $205.8 million at June 30, 2010, including a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility with $95.0 million available as of June 30, 2010. 37 Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided from operating activities $ 250,579 $ 369,898 $ 479,134 Cash used for investing activities (216,871 ) (253,086 ) (218,156 ) Cash used for financing activities (83,236 ) (155,582 ) (197,306 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,173 (12,030 ) 33,474 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (48,355 ) $ (50,800 ) $ 97,146 Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2010 declined by $119.3 million from the prior year due mainly to an increase in working capital needs in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Our restructuring accrual as of June 30, 2010 was $26.9 million, which we expect to reduce through cash outlays during fiscal 2011. Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2009 decreased by $109.2 million from fiscal 2008 due primarily to lower net revenue and income, partially offset by a related decline in working capital needs in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities declined by $36.2 million due mainly to $10.1 million invested in acquisitions during fiscal 2010 compared with $74.8 million during fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, we completed an asset purchase of a company in China for $10.1 million and have initially recorded goodwill of $2.2 million. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analysis is completed and more information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. During fiscal 2009, we completed the acquisition of two companies and a joint venture in cash transactions approximating $74.8 million. We recorded additional goodwill of $27.9 million in connection with the acquisitions. On July 19, 2007, we completed an acquisition of a U.S. based company in an all cash transaction approximating $42.5 million. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions is complete. Capital expenditures increased $51.5 million during fiscal 2010 as demand and production increased. Capital expenditures declined $56.7 million during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 as customer demand declined. We had $25.5 million in net sales of marketable securities during fiscal 2010, which increased cash flow, compared with $13.2 million net purchases in fiscal 2009, which decreased cash flow. We had $46.8 million net sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2008. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities decreased $72.3 million during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to the $54.1 million reduction of outstanding loans for Molex Japan. On June 25, 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility. Borrowings were $100.0 million as of June 30, 2010, which was used to pay down other uncommitted debt balances in fiscal 2009. On August 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009. We purchased shares of Common Stock and 38 Class A Common Stock totaling 4.5 million shares and 8.0 million shares during fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The aggregate cost of these purchases was $76.3 million and $199.6 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. As part of our growth strategy, in the future we may acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisition we complete may impact our cash requirements. Any liability, if any, and related costs for unauthorized loans in Japan may also impact our cash requirements. Sources of Liquidity We believe we have sufficient cash balances, cash flow and available credit lines to support our planned growth. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may affect our cash requirements and debt balances. Total debt consisted of the following at June 30: Average Interest Rate Maturity 2010 2009 Long term debt: U.S. Credit Facility 2.85 % 2012 $ 100,000 $ 25,000 Unsecured bonds and term loans 1.31 1.65 % 2012 2013 81,431 Mortgages, industrial development bonds and other debt 5.90 7.80 % 2012 2013 2,003 5,311 Total long term debt 183,434 30,311 Current portion of long term debt and short term borrowings: Unsecured bonds, term loans and short term credit line 1.31 1.65 % 104,359 208,007 Other short term borrowings, including capital leases 4.86 % 5,711 16,333 Total current portion of long term debt and short term Borrowings 110,070 224,340 Total debt $ 293,504 $ 254,651 In March 2010, Molex Japan entered into a 3 billion syndicated term loan for three years, with interest rates equivalent to 6 month Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus 75 basis points and scheduled principal payments of 0.5 billion every 6 months (the Syndicated Term Loan). In September 2009, Molex Japan issued unsecured bonds totaling 10 billion with a term of three years, an interest rate of approximately 1.65% and scheduled principal payments of 1.6 billion every 6 months, plus a balloon payment. In June 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million committed, unsecured, three year revolving credit facility in the United States, amended in January 2010, that matures in June 2012 (the U.S. Credit Facility). Borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate (based on London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 250 basis points as of June 30, 2010. On up to two occasions we may, at our option, increase the credit line by an amount not to exceed $75.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The instrument governing the U.S. Credit Facility contains customary covenants regarding liens, debt, substantial asset sales and mergers, dividends and investments. The U.S. Credit Facility also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage, fixed charge coverage and liquidity. As of June 30, 2010, we were in compliance with these covenants and had outstanding borrowings of $100.0 million. 39 Certain assets, including land, buildings and equipment, secure a portion of our long term debt. Principal payments on long term debt obligations are due as follows: fiscal 2012, $47.7 million; fiscal 2013, $133.9 million; fiscal 2014, $1.8 million. We had available lines of credit totaling $205.8 million at June 30, 2010 expiring between 2010 and 2013. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2010, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 4 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 37,707 $ 15,138 $ 13,205 $ 7,701 $ 1,663 Capital lease obligations 6,133 3,160 2,896 77 Other long term liabilities 10,713 2,878 971 38 6,826 Debt obligations 291,590 108,748 182,810 32 Total(1) $ 346,143 $ 129,924 $ 199,882 $ 7,848 $ 8,489 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Debt and capital lease obligations include interest payments. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. 40 Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 10, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize net revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on net revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of net revenue. Income Taxes As a result of the implementation of ASC 740 10, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective July 1, 2009, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Prior to adoption of ASC 740 10, our policy was to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We established the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $206.7 million at June 30, 2010. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $77.4 million at June 30, 2010. Entities with net operating losses were able to utilize $1.9 million of these losses during fiscal 2010. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering 41 inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the pension benefit obligation (PBO), are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The discount rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each years expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for U.S. pension obligations. The discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by using a yield curve approach or by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets. In those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. For additional information concerning the assumptions see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2010, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (5,491 ) $ (10,429 ) $ (277 ) $ (154 ) Decrease 50 basis points 6,290 11,874 295 164 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A 493 518 Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A (493 ) (518 ) Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in 42 the discount rate assumption for our retiree healthcare plans as of June 30, 2010, assuming no change in benefit levels is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Total Annual Service Increase (Decrease) and Interest Cost in APBO Increase 100 basis points: $ 539 $ 6,778 Decrease 100 basis points: (449 ) (5,955 ) Stock Options We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock. We estimate the expected life of the option using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 10 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as of June 30, 2010 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Total Markets for Other Significant Measured Identical Observable Unobservable at Fair Assets Inputs Inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale and trading securities $ 33,032 $ 33,032 $ $ Derivative financial instruments, net 3,644 3,644 We determine the fair value of our available for sale securities based on quoted market prices (Level 1). We generally use derivatives for hedging purposes pursuant to ASC 815 10, which are valued based on Level 2 inputs in the ASC 820 10 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our financial instruments is determined by a mark to market valuation based on forward curves using observable market prices. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are generally based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, net revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. 43 Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs and Asset Impairments We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. We recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are expensed and accrued when it is determined that a liability is probable, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized upon approval of a restructuring plan by management or in future accounting periods when terminated employees continue to provide service. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) For available for sale securities, we presume an OTTI decline in value if the quoted market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a continuous period of six months or more. However, the presumption of an OTTI decline in value may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we evaluate all known quantitative and qualitative factors in addition to quoted market prices in determining whether an OTTI decline in value exists. Factors that we consider important in evaluating for a potential OTTI, include historical operating performance, future financial projections, business plans for new products or concepts and strength of balance sheet. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of ASC 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective September 30, 2009, we adopted ASC 105, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Codification is now the single source of authoritative GAAP for all non governmental entities. ASC 105, which was effective July 1, 2009, changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance. The adoption of ASC 105 will only affect how specific references to GAAP literature are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We adopted ASC 805 10, Business Combinations, effective July 1, 2009. ASC 805 10 requires that acquisition related costs are recognized separately from an acquisition and expensed as incurred and that restructuring costs are expensed in periods after the acquisition date. ASC 805 10 also 44 requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. The impact of the adoption of ASC 805 10 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We adopted ASC 810 10, Consolidation, effective July 1, 2009. ASC 810 10 requires interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than us to be reported separately within the equity section of the consolidated financial statements and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control be accounted for as equity transactions. It also requires net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling interest in a former subsidiary and resulting gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary, is measured at fair value. The adoption of ASC 810 10 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We adopted ASC 815 10, Derivatives and Hedging, effective July 1, 2009. ASC 815 10 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities. The adoption of ASC 815 10 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. Under this amended guidance, SEC filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised consolidated financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). The accounting standard update addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit. Specifically, this subtopic addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. ASU 2009 13 will be effective for us on July 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2009 13, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB expanded ASC 810 10, to provide guidance for variable interest entities (VIEs). The change modifies our approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE by assessing whether we have control over such entities. This change is effective for us on July 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the requirements of the VIE provisions of ASC 810 10, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. No material foreign exchange contracts were in use at June 30, 2010 and 2009. 45 We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $60.2 million and increased income from operations of $6.5 million for 2010, compared with the estimated results for 2009 using the average rates for 2009. Our $18.5 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2010 are principally invested in time deposits. Interest rate exposure is generally limited to our marketable securities, U.S. Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Our marketable securities mature in less than 12 months. We had $100 million outsanding on the U.S. Credit Facility with an interest rate of approximately 2.85% at June 30, 2010. The balance of our Syndicated Term Loan was approximately $33.9 million with an interest rate of approximately 1.31% at June 30, 2010. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers or products. Approximately 28% and 18% of net revenue in fiscal 2010 was derived from operations from China and Japan, respectively. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 46
