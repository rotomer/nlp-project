Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of Molex, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward looking statements included under Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All references to fiscal years relate to the fiscal year ended June 30. Overview Our Business Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electronic components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 different products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches in 39 manufacturing locations in 16 countries. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. We have two global product segments: Connector and Custom Electrical. The Connector segment designs and manufactures products for high speed, high density, high signal integrity applications as well as fine pitch, low profile connectors for the consumer and commercial markets. It also designs and manufactures products that withstand environments such as heat, cold, dust, dirt, liquid and vibration for automotive and other transportation applications. The Custom Electrical segment designs and manufactures integrated and customizable electronic components across all industries that provide original, differentiated solutions to customer requirements. It also leverages expertise in the use of signal, power and interface technology in industrial automation and other harsh environment applications. We sell our products in five primary markets. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, infotech, consumer, industrial and automotive markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile phones, digital electronics such as cameras and flat panel display televisions, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory robotics and diagnostic equipment. Net revenue by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and changes in their net revenue levels and new products or 28 Table of Contents model changes that we or our customers introduce. The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by primary markets.

Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. In fiscal 2011, 61.3% of our net revenue was derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region. We expect greater economic growth in Asia, particularly in China, than in the Americas and Europe. We continue to expand our manufacturing operations in lower cost regions. Approximately 56% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. In addition, reduced trade barriers and improved supply chain logistics have reduced our need to duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, we have consolidated multiple plants of modest size and established a strategy of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in select locations. We believe that our business is positioned to benefit from this strategy. Business Environment The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are one of the worlds largest manufacturers of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. 29 Table of Contents The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. Our financial results are influenced by factors in the markets in which we operate and by our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. Marketplace factors include competition for customers, raw material prices, product and price competition, economic conditions in various geographic regions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, fluctuations in customer demand, patent and intellectual property issues, natural disasters, litigation results and legal and regulatory developments. Our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges, including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate manufacturing to such demand, manage volatile raw material costs, develop, manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines, control operating costs, and attract, motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational, financial and management information systems. Our sales are also dependent on end markets impacted by consumer, industrial and infrastructure spending and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in these end markets. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net revenue growth, which is included in Managements Discussion Analysis, is a non GAAP financial measure. The tables presented in Results of Operations provide reconciliations of U.S. GAAP reported net revenue growth (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to organic net revenue growth. We believe organic net revenue growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net revenue growth to monitor and evaluate performance, since it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition activity. Management uses organic net revenue growth together with GAAP measures such as net revenue and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. Because organic net revenue growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similar measures of other companies. Unauthorized Activities in Japan As we previously reported in our fiscal 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities at Molex Japan Co., Ltd. in April 2010. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japans finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japans name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japans name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japans accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation has been completed. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment. As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended June 30, 2010, based on the results of the completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters including the legal proceedings reported in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010, with approximately $167.4 million of losses occurring prior to June 30, 2007. The 30 Table of Contents accrued liability for these potential net losses was $182.5 million as of June 30, 2011, including $16.6 million in cumulative foreign currency translation, which was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the outstanding unauthorized loans, we would recognize a gain in that amount. In addition, we have a contingent liability of $31.2 million for other loan related expenses, interest expense and delay damages on the outstanding unauthorized loans. Financial Highlights Net revenue for fiscal 2011 of $3.6 billion increased 19.2% from fiscal 2010. Organic net revenue increased 16.2% in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Income from operations for fiscal 2011 of $430.2 million increased 212% compared with fiscal 2010 as we completed our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. We recognized net income of $298.8 million in fiscal 2011 compared with net income of $76.9 million in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 results include a net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan of $14.5 million ($10.1 million after tax). Fiscal 2010 results include restructuring charges of $117.1 million ($92.8 million after tax) and a net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan of $26.9 million ($17.1 million after tax). Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue (dollars in thousands): Percentage of Percentage of Percentage of 2011 Net Revenue 2010 Net Revenue 2009 Net Revenue Net revenue $ 3,587,334 100.0 % $ 3,007,207 100.0 % $ 2,581,841 100.0 % Cost of sales 2,499,197 69.7 % 2,114,584 70.3 % 1,925,664 74.6 % Gross profit 1,088,137 30.3 % 892,623 29.7 % 656,177 25.4 % Selling, general administrative 643,462 17.9 % 610,784 20.3 % 586,702 22.7 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments % 117,139 3.9 % 151,531 5.9 % Unauthorized activities in Japan 14,476 0.4 % 26,898 0.9 % 2,685 0.1 % Goodwill impairments % % 264,140 10.2 % Income (loss) from operations 430,199 12.0 % 137,802 4.6 % (348,881 ) (13.5 )% Other (expense) income, net (260 ) % (6,313 ) (0.2 )% 27,308 1.0 % Income (loss) before income taxes 429,939 12.0 % 131,489 4.4 % (321,573 ) (12.5 )% Income taxes 131,131 3.7 % 54,559 1.8 % 463 0.0 % Net income (loss) $ 298,808 8.3 % $ 76,930 2.6 % $ (322,036 ) (12.5 )% 31 Table of Contents Net Revenue The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2011 2010 Net revenue for prior year $ 3,007,207 $ 2,581,841 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue increase 488,123 334,843 Currency translation 82,742 60,236 Acquisitions 9,262 30,287 Total change in net revenue from prior year 580,127 425,366 Net revenue for current year $ 3,587,334 $ 3,007,207 Organic net revenue increase as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 16.2 % 13.0 % Net revenue increased during fiscal 2011 and 2010 as customer demand improved in all of our primary markets compared with the prior fiscal years. Excluding the telecommunications market in fiscal 2010, we experienced double digit percentage growth in net revenue in each of our primary markets in fiscal 2011 and 2010 compared with the prior fiscal years. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was principally due to a stronger Japanese yen and weaker U.S. dollar against most currencies except the euro. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was principally due to stronger Asian currencies. The following tables show the effect on the change in geographic net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar (in thousands): June 30, 2011 June 30, 2010 Local Currency Net Local Currency Net Currency Translation Change Currency Translation Change Americas $ 136,321 $ 1,073 $ 137,394 $ 46,217 $ 1,384 $ 47,601 Asia Pacific 301,824 96,776 398,600 336,195 58,199 394,394 Europe 59,427 (15,107 ) 44,320 (9,355 ) 653 (8,702 ) Corporate Other (187 ) (187 ) (7,927 ) (7,927 ) Net change $ 497,385 $ 82,742 $ 580,127 $ 365,130 $ 60,236 $ 425,366 The change in net revenue on a local currency basis as of June 30 follows: 2011 2010 Americas 18.5 % 6.7 % Asia Pacific 21.0 42.3 Europe 12.5 (1.9 ) Total 16.5 % 16.5 % Net revenue increased across all five primary markets in fiscal 2011 and 2010 compared with prior fiscal periods as customer demand improved over the prior years. Net revenue in Japan weakened at the end of fiscal 2011 due to the impact of the March 11, 2011 earthquake on the Japanese economy. 32 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2011 and 2010, changes in net revenue from each of our five primary product markets from the prior fiscal year: 2011 2010 Telecommunications 21 % 3 % Infotech 24 21 Consumer 12 25 Industrial 23 13 Automotive 16 26 Telecommunications market net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 due to higher infrastructure spending and increased demand for mobile products, including higher demand for smartphones and our customers introduction of smartphone models with higher connector content. Telecommunications market net revenue increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to increased infrastructure spending, higher demand for smartphones and our customers introduction of smartphone models that include our connector products, partially offset by a decline in standard feature mobile phones. Infotech market net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased content and demand for servers, data storage, notebook computers and tablet devices. Infotech market net revenue for fiscal 2010 increased significantly compared with fiscal 2009 because of increased demand for notebooks, storage products, computers and accessories and depressed enterprise spending in the prior year. Consumer market net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased demand for our components in flat panel display televisions, digital cameras and home appliances, as well as expansion into the non connector audio accessories market, partially offset by reduced demand in gaming equipment. Consumer market net revenue increased significantly in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to government incentives in certain countries, customers replenishing inventory levels and increased demand for our components in flat panel display televisions, digital cameras and home appliances. Industrial market net revenue for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to higher demand for our connectors in semiconductor and other production equipment as our customers increased production to meet demand. Industrial market net revenue for fiscal 2010 increased compared with fiscal 2009 as global economic conditions improved over the prior year. Demand for industrial instruments and production equipment improved as our customers increased production to meet demand after delaying many industrial automation projects due to uncertainties about the economic conditions. Automotive market net revenue for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to increased automobile production levels in the United States and China and our customers increasing electronic content in automobiles, such as navigational and entertainment systems, mobile communication and products to promote fuel efficiency. Automotive market net revenue for fiscal 2010 increased substantially compared with fiscal 2009 as global car sales have increased, particularly in North America, China and Europe, as improving global economic conditions led to our customers increasing vehicle builds to replenish inventory levels and meet demand. Gross Profit We measure gross profit as net revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, such as materials, direct and indirect labor, and factory overhead. Our gross margins are primarily affected by the following factors: product mix; volume; cost reduction efforts; competitive pricing pressure; commodity costs and currency fluctuations. 33 Table of Contents The following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Gross profit $ 1,088,137 $ 892,623 $ 656,177 Gross margin 30.3 % 29.7 % 25.4 % The increase in gross margin during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increased net revenue. Gross margins have improved over time due to lower costs resulting from our restructuring program. The improvements in gross profit and gross margin were partially offset by the impact of price erosion and material price increases. The increase in gross margin during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher absorption from increased production and lower costs resulting from our restructuring program. The improvements in gross profit were partially offset by the impact of price erosion, material price increases and increased delivery costs to meet the significant increase in demand. A significant portion of our material cost consists of copper and gold costs. We purchased approximately 22 million pounds of copper and 125,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 23 million pounds of copper and 112,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2010 and approximately 16 million pounds of copper and 87,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2009. The following table sets forth the average prices of copper and gold we purchased in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Copper (price per pound) $ 3.88 $ 3.04 $ 2.69 Gold (price per troy ounce) 1,363.00 1,096.00 872.00 Generally, we are able to pass through to our customers only a small a portion of the changes in the cost of copper and gold. However, we mitigated the impact of the change in copper and gold prices by hedging with call options a portion of our projected net global purchases of copper and gold. The hedges reduced cost of sales by $7.2 million and $5.1 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The hedges did not materially affect the operating results for fiscal 2009. In addition to commodity costs, the following table sets forth, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 the effects of certain significant impacts on gross profit from the prior year (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Price erosion $ (108,467 ) $ (124,787 ) $ (97,643 ) Currency translation 37,958 23,928 4,590 Currency transaction (57,763 ) (22,076 ) (14,382 ) Price erosion measures the reduction in prices of our products year over year, which reduces our gross profit. Price erosion as a percent of net revenue was 2.9%, 4.0% and 3.6% in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen against other currencies and a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies except the euro. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger Asian currencies. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen against other currencies, partially offset by a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Certain products that we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen and a weaker U.S. dollar against most currencies. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a general 34 Table of Contents weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies except the euro. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transaction losses in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general administrative $ 643,462 $ 610,784 $ 586,702 Selling, general administrative as a percentage of net revenue 17.9 % 20.3 % 22.7 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 117,139 151,531 Unauthorized activities in Japan 14,476 26,898 2,685 Goodwill impairments 264,140 Selling, general administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expense increased $32.7 million in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to foreign currency translation, investments in our global sales and marketing organization and research and development to drive future growth. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $12.7 million for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $13.7 million for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to efforts to control spending as net revenue increased. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $24.1 million in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased headcount and certain employee benefits that were suspended during fiscal 2009, but were reinstated in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to our lower cost structure resulting from our restructuring efforts and specific cost containment activities. Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expense, were $170.1 million, or 4.7% of net revenue, for fiscal 2011 compared with $154.0 million, or 5.1% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010 and $159.2 million, or 6.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009. Research and development expense increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 as we made strategic investments in developing future technology innovations following cost containment efforts in the prior year. The decrease in research and development expense in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 is primarily due to efforts to contain cost. Restructuring costs and asset impairments Restructuring costs and asset impairments consist of the following (in thousands): 2010 2009 Severance costs $ 79,609 $ 110,155 Asset impairments 37,296 21,128 Restructuring costs 116,905 131,283 Intangible asset impairments 234 16,300 Other charges 3,948 Total restructuring charges and asset impairments $ 117,139 $ 151,531 During fiscal 2007, we undertook a multi year restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital in connection with a new global organization that was effective 35 Table of Contents July 1, 2007. A majority of the plan related to facilities located in North America, Europe and Japan and, in general, the movement of manufacturing activities at these plants to other lower cost facilities. We completed our restructuring program on June 30, 2010 with cumulative expense of $314.8 million since we announced the restructuring plan. Annual cost savings related to the restructuring program are estimated to be $205.0 million. In fiscal 2010, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 1,000 employees, resulting in a charge of $79.6 million. A large part of these employee terminations resulted from plant closings in Europe. We recognized asset impairment charges of $37.3 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. In fiscal 2009, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,600 employees, resulting in a charge of $110.2 million. A large part of these employee terminations resulted from plant closings in Europe and Asia. We recognized asset impairment charges of $41.4 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. Restructuring costs and asset impairments in fiscal 2009 included intangible asset impairments of $16.3 million due to lower projected future net revenue and profit in our Industrial business unit of our Custom Electrical segment. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Fiscal 2009 income from operations included goodwill impairment charges of $264.1 million. We recorded $93.1 million and $171.0 million goodwill impairment charges in the Transportation business unit of our Connector segment and Industrial business unit of our Custom Electrical segment, respectively. The economic downturn in fiscal 2009 had a negative impact on the business units operating results. The potential liquidity risk extended our estimate for the automotive industrys economic recovery and our Industrial business units results were not recovering in line with other business units. These factors resulted in lower growth and profit expectations for these business units, which resulted in the goodwill impairment charges. Other (Expense) Income, net Other (expense) income consists primarily of investment income, net interest expense or income, and currency exchange gains or losses. Interest expense and foreign currency losses principally offset investment income in fiscal 2011 and 2010. Currency exchange losses for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $11.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, partially offset by a stronger Japanese yen against most other currencies. Currency exchange gains in fiscal 2009 were $11.8 million due to a stronger U.S. dollar and Japanese yen against most other currencies. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended June 30, follows: 2011 2010 2009 Effective tax rate 30.5 % 41.5 % (0.1 )% The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 30.5%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher than fiscal 2011 due to (1) income tax expense booked during the year of $7.7 million, due primarily to the reversal of an estimated tax benefit resulting from a significant number of employee stock options that expired unexercised, (2) a charge due to legislation passed during fiscal 2010 which includes a provision that reduces the deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of retiree prescription drug 36 Table of Contents benefits to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, (3) tax losses generated in non U.S. jurisdictions for which no tax benefit has been recognized, and (4) additional U.S. tax cost to repatriate earnings from non US subsidiaries during the year. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was (0.1%) due primarily to charges for goodwill impairments for which no tax benefit was available and increases in tax reserves based on evaluation of certain tax positions taken. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $167.3 million at June 30, 2011. Results by Product Segment Connector. The following table sets forth the change in net revenue for the Connector segment for fiscal 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2010 Net revenue for prior year $ 2,177,014 $ 1,789,139 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue increase 350,905 308,947 Currency translation 72,550 54,224 Acquisitions 24,704 Total change in net revenue from prior year 423,455 387,875 Net revenue for current year $ 2,600,469 $ 2,177,014 Organic net revenue increase as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 16.1 % 17.3 % The Connector segment sells primarily to the telecommunications, infotech, automotive and consumer markets, which are discussed above. Segment net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 compared with the prior year periods due to increased demand in all of the Connector segments primary markets, partially offset by price erosion. Price erosion, which is generally higher in the Connector segment compared with our other segments, was 3.3% and 4.5% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table sets forth information on income from operations and operating margins for the Connector segment for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Income (loss) from operations $ 396,233 $ 123,980 $ (125,604 ) Operating margin 15.2 % 5.7 % (7.0 )% Connector segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased net revenue and completion of our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. Gross margins were positively impacted from lower costs from our restructuring program, which has improved margins over time. Connector segment income from operations also improved in fiscal 2011 due to controlled selling, general and administrative costs in a period of increased net revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $368.4 million, or 14.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2011 compared with $347.6 million or 16.0% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010, due to efficiencies gained from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Connector segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased net revenue and the $93.1 million goodwill impairment charge during fiscal 2009 to write off goodwill based on lower projected future net revenue and profit growth in our Transportation business unit. Gross margins in fiscal 2010 were positively affected by higher absorption and restructuring. Connector segment income from operations also improved due to lower selling, general and administrative costs in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 37 Table of Contents $347.6 million, or 16.0% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010 compared with $365.5 million, or 20.5% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009, due to savings from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Income from operations was unfavorably impacted by restructuring costs of $100.3 million and $93.9 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Custom Electrical. The following table sets forth net revenue for fiscal 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2010 Net revenue for prior year $ 828,905 $ 790,601 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue increase 136,757 26,673 Currency translation 10,196 6,048 Acquisitions 9,262 5,583 Total change in net revenue from prior year 156,215 38,304 Net revenue for current year $ 985,120 $ 828,905 Organic net revenue increase growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 16.5 % 3.4 % The sale of Custom Electrical segments products is concentrated in the industrial, telecommunications and infotech markets. Custom Electrical segment organic net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 due to increased demand in all of the segments primary markets. We also completed an asset acquisition of an active optical cable business during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and completed an asset purchase of a company in China during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The following table sets forth income from operations and operating margins for the Custom Electrical segment for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Income (loss) from operations $ 154,370 $ 111,083 $ (152,443 ) Operating margin 15.7 % 13.4 % (19.3 )% Custom Electrical segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased net revenue and completion of our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. Gross margins were positively impacted from lower costs from our restructuring program, which has improved margins over time. Income from operations also improved in fiscal 2011 due to controlled selling, general and administrative costs in a period of increased net revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $169.6 million, or 17.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2011 compared with $168.5 million, or 20.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010, due to efficiencies gained from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Custom Electrical segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased net revenue, lower selling, general and administrative costs and the $171.0 million goodwill impairment charge and $16.3 million intangible asset charge during fiscal 2009 to write off goodwill and intangible assets in our Industrial business unit due to lower projected future net revenue and profit growth. Gross margins in fiscal 2010 were positively affected by higher absorption and restructuring. Custom Electrical segment income from operations also improved due to lower selling, general and administrative costs in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $168.5 million, or 20.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010 compared with $186.0 million, or 23.5% of net revenue, for fiscal 2009, due to savings from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Income from operations was unfavorably impacted by restructuring costs of $12.2 million and $39.3 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity We fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash on hand. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $546.5 million and $394.9 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which approximately $514.3 million was in non U.S. accounts, including $183.2 million in China, as of June 30, 2011. Transferring cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities to U.S. accounts from non U.S. accounts could subject us to additional U.S. repatriation income tax. Principal uses of cash are capital expenditures, dividend payments and business investments. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. In June 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million unsecured, three year revolving credit facility in the United States, amended in January 2010 and September 2010, that was initially scheduled to mature in June 2012 (the U.S. Credit Facility). In connection with the September 2010 amendment, we increased the credit line on the U.S. Credit Facility to $270.0 million. In March 2011, we amended the credit facility to increase the credit line to $350.0 million and extend the term to March 2016. Total debt, including obligations under capital leases totaled $342.6 million and $293.5 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We had available lines of credit totaling $244.3 million at June 30, 2011, including $165.0 million available under the U.S. Credit Facility as of June 30, 2011. The U.S. Credit Facility also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage. As of June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, we have three unsecured borrowing agreements in Japan totaling 12.2 billion ($151.4 million) as of June 30, 2011, with weighted average fixed interest rates of 1.25%. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided from operating activities $ 466,151 $ 250,579 $ 369,898 Cash used for investing activities (270,709 ) (216,871 ) (253,086 ) Cash used for financing activities (77,191 ) (83,236 ) (155,582 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 37,996 1,173 (12,030 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 156,247 $ (48,355 ) $ (50,800 ) Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2011 increased by $215.6 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in net income in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Working capital needs increased $116.0 million in fiscal 2011 as inventory production increased due to customer demand and supply chain inventory increased due to the conversion from air shipment to sea shipment. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Our restructuring accrual as of June 30, 2011 was $14.0 million compared to $26.9 million as of June 30, 2010, which was reduced through cash outlays during fiscal 2011. Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2010 decreased $119.3 million from fiscal 2009 due mainly to an increase in working capital needs in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities increased by $53.8 million due to increased investments in capital expenditures and acquisitions and lower net sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. 39 Table of Contents During fiscal 2011, we completed an asset acquisition of an active optical cable business for $24.6 million and recorded goodwill of $14.6 million. The purchase price includes contingent consideration up to $5.8 million. During fiscal 2010, we completed an asset purchase of a company in China for $10.1 million. During fiscal 2009, we completed the acquisition of two companies and a joint venture in cash transactions approximating $74.8 million. We recorded additional goodwill of $27.9 million in connection with the acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased $32.8 million during fiscal 2011 as demand and production increased. Capital expenditures increased $51.5 million during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 as demand and production increased. We had $3.6 million in net sales of marketable securities during fiscal 2011 compared with $25.5 million in net sales of marketable securities during fiscal 2010. We had $13.2 million net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2009. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities decreased $6.0 million during fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in net proceeds from the revolving credit facility, partially offset by an increase in quarterly cash dividends paid. Net borrowings against our $350.0 million unsecured, five year revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended June 30, 2011 were $85.0 million compared to $75.0 million in the prior year period. Total borrowings against the credit facility were $185.0 million as of June 30, 2011. We increased our quarterly cash dividend in fiscal 2011 to $0.1750 per share, an increase of 14.8% from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.1525 per share in fiscal 2010. The increase was effective to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010. We increased our cash dividend again during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to $0.2000 per share, which was effective to shareholders of record on June 30, 2011. On August 1, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009. We purchased shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock totaling 4.5 million shares during fiscal 2009. The aggregate cost of the purchase was $76.3 million for fiscal 2009. As part of our growth strategy, in the future we may acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may impact our cash requirements. To the extent we are required to pay all or any portion of the unauthorized loans in Molex Japan our cash requirements may also be impacted. Sources of Liquidity We believe we have sufficient cash balances, cash flow and available credit lines to support our planned growth. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may affect our cash requirements and debt balances. 40 Table of Contents Total debt consisted of the following at June 30: Average Interest Rate Maturity 2011 2010 Long term debt: U.S. Credit Facility 2.05 % 2016 $ 185,000 $ 100,000 Unsecured bonds and term loans 0.77 1.31 % 2012 2013 89,342 129,225 Mortgages, industrial development bonds and other debt 5.92 % 2012 2013 1,528 5,132 Total long term debt 275,870 234,357 Less current portion of long term debt: Unsecured bonds and term loans 0.77 1.31 % 52,156 47,794 Mortgages, industrial development bonds and other debt 5.92 % 920 3,129 Long term debt, less current portion 222,794 183,434 Short term borrowings Overdraft loan 2.48 % 2012 62,060 56,565 Other short term borrowings 5.92 % 4,628 2,582 Total short term borrowings 66,688 59,147 Total debt $ 342,558 $ 293,504 In June 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million unsecured, three year revolving credit facility in the United States, amended in January 2010, September 2010 and March 2011 that was initially scheduled to mature in June 2012 (the U.S. Credit Facility). In connection with the September 2010 amendment, we increased the credit line on the U.S. Credit Facility to $270.0 million. In March 2011, we further amended the credit facility to increase the credit line to $350.0 million and extend the term to March 2016. Borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate (based on London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 150 basis points as of June 30, 2011. The instrument governing the U.S. Credit Facility contains customary covenants regarding liens, debt, substantial asset sales and mergers, dividends and investments. The U.S. Credit Facility also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage. As of June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with these covenants and had outstanding borrowings of $185.0 million. In March 2011, Molex Japan renewed a 5.0 billion overdraft loan, with a six month term and an interest rate of approximately 2.48%. At June 30, 2011, the balance of the overdraft loan, which requires full repayment by the end of the term if not renewed, approximated $62.1 million. In March 2010, Molex Japan entered into a 3.0 billion syndicated term loan for three years, with interest rates equivalent to six month Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus 75 basis points and scheduled principal payments of 0.5 billion every six months (Syndicated Term Loan). At June 30, 2011, the balance of the syndicated term loan approximated $24.8 million, of which $12.4 million was current. In September 2009, Molex Japan issued unsecured bonds totaling 10.0 billion with a term of three years, an interest rate of approximately 1.65% and scheduled principal payments of 1.6 billion every six months. At June 30, 2011, the outstanding balance of the unsecured bonds approximated $64.5 million, of which $39.7 million was current. 41 Table of Contents Certain assets, including land, buildings and equipment, secure a portion of our long term debt. Principal payments on long term debt obligations are due as follows (in thousands): 2012 $ 53,076 2013 37,762 2014 32 2015 2016 185,000 Total long term debt obligations $ 275,870 We had available lines of credit totaling $244.3 million at June 30, 2011 expiring between 2011 and 2016. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2011, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 4 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 38,845 $ 16,107 $ 12,809 $ 8,413 $ 1,516 Capital lease obligations 4,668 1,093 3,391 184 Other long term liabilities 10,433 1,066 412 9 8,946 Debt obligations 342,558 119,764 222,794 Total(1) $ 396,504 $ 138,030 $ 239,406 $ 8,606 $ 10,462 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities for certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Debt and capital lease obligations include interest payments. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP 42 Table of Contents requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 10, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize net revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on net revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of net revenue. Income Taxes As a result of the implementation of ASC 740 10, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective July 1, 2009, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Prior to adoption of ASC 740 10, our policy was to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities. We established the accruals based upon managements assessment of probable income tax contingencies. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $167.3 million at June 30, 2011. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $67.3 million at June 30, 2011. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of 43 Table of Contents how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. Subsidiaries with historical net operating losses were able to utilize $83.7 million of these losses during fiscal 2011. Provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. Three critical assumptions used, which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the pension benefit obligation (PBO), are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The discount rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each years expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for U.S. pension obligations. The discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by using a yield curve approach or by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets. In those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. For additional information concerning the assumptions see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2011, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in PBO in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (5,563 ) $ (9,840 ) $ (95 ) $ (90 ) Decrease 50 basis points 6,259 11,068 96 55 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A 613 613 Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A (613 ) (613 ) Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the U.S. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates for our retiree healthcare plans as of June 30, 2011, assuming no change in benefit levels is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease) Total Annual Service Increase (Decrease) and Interest Cost in APBO Increase 100 basis points: $ 676 $ 6,827 Decrease 100 basis points: (553 ) (5,621 ) Stock Options We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock. We estimate the expected life of the option using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as of June 30, 2011 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Total Markets for Other Significant Measured Identical Observable Unobservable at Fair Assets Inputs Inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Available for sale and trading securities $ 26,073 $ 26,073 $ $ Derivative financial instruments, net 10,440 10,440 We determine the fair value of our available for sale securities based on quoted market prices (Level 1). We generally use derivatives for hedging purposes pursuant to ASC 815 10, which are valued based on Level 2 inputs in the ASC 820 10 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our financial instruments is determined by a mark to market valuation based on forward curves using observable market prices. The carrying value of our long term debt approximates fair value. 45 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are generally based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, net revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Restructuring Costs and Asset Impairments We have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business. We recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred. The main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities. Workforce related charges are expensed and accrued when it is determined that a liability is probable, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments, but under certain circumstances may be recognized upon approval of a restructuring plan by management or in future accounting periods when terminated employees continue to provide service. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees, future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income, and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold. Charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring program, which we completed on June 30, 2010, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Forward Looking Statements. Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) For available for sale securities, we presume an OTTI decline in value if the quoted market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a continuous period of six months or more. However, the presumption of an OTTI decline in value may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we evaluate all known quantitative and qualitative factors in addition to quoted market prices in determining whether an OTTI decline in value exists. Factors that we consider important in evaluating for a potential OTTI, include historical operating performance, future financial projections, business plans for new products or concepts and strength of balance sheet. 46 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with ASC 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. Contingencies In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, we analyze whether it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue for costs associated with the loss contingency, including direct costs incurred. If no accrual is made but the loss contingency is reasonably possible, we disclose the nature of the contingency and the related estimate of possible loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made. Loss contingencies include, but are not limited to, possible losses related to legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters. Liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops, circumstances change, or contingencies are resolved. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). This new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for us for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and will amend our presentation of the components of comprehensive income. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which is effective for us for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency limiting the need to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. 47 Table of Contents We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the foreign exchange contracts in use at June 30, 2011 and 2010. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances and call options on certain commodities. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the derivative instruments in use at June 30, 2011 and 2010 The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $82.7 million and increased income from operations of $17.2 million for fiscal 2011, compared with the estimated results for fiscal 2010 using the average rates for 2010. Our $13.9 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2011 are principally invested in time deposits. Interest rate exposure is generally limited to our marketable securities, U.S. Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Our marketable securities mature in less than 12 months. We had $185.0 million outstanding on the U.S. Credit Facility with an interest rate of approximately 2.05% at June 30, 2011. The balance of our Syndicated Term Loan was approximately $24.8 million with an interest rate of approximately 1.31% at June 30, 2011. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers or products. Approximately 32% and 16% of net revenue in fiscal 2011 was derived from operations from China and Japan, respectively. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 48 Table of Contents
