Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of Molex, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward looking statements included under Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All references to fiscal years relate to the fiscal year ended June 30. Overview Our Business Our core business is the manufacture and sale of electronic components. Our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) throughout the world. We design, manufacture and sell more than 100,000 different products including terminals, connectors, planar cables, cable assemblies, interconnection systems, backplanes, integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches in 40 manufacturing locations in 16 countries. We also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customers product. We have two global product segments: Connector and Custom & Electrical. The Connector segment designs and manufactures products for high speed, high density, high signal integrity applications as well as fine pitch, low profile connectors for the consumer and commercial markets. It also designs and manufactures products that withstand environments such as heat, cold, dust, dirt, liquid and vibration for automotive and other transportation applications. The Custom & Electrical segment designs and manufactures integrated and customizable electronic components, including connectors, across all industries that provide original, differentiated solutions to customer requirements. It also leverages expertise in the use of signal, power and interface technology in industrial automation and other harsh environment applications. We sell our products in five primary markets. Our connectors, interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications, infotech, consumer, industrial and automotive markets. Our products are used in a wide range of applications including notebook computers, computer peripheral equipment, mobile products such as smartphones and tablets, digital electronics such as cameras and televisions, gaming systems, automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems, factory automation and diagnostic equipment. 27 Table of Contents Net revenue by market can fluctuate based on various factors including economic conditions, new technologies within the industry, composition of customers and changes in their net revenue or inventory levels and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce. The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by primary markets: 2012 2011 2010 Telecommunications 23 % 25 % 25 % Infotech 26 23 22 Consumer 18 19 20 Industrial 13 15 14 Automotive 17 15 16 Other 3 3 3 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by geographic region: 2012 2011 2010 Americas 26.2 % 24.3 % 24.4 % Asia Pacific 60.0 61.3 59.8 Europe 13.8 14.4 15.8 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the percentage relationship to net revenue of our sales by reporting segment: 2012 2011 2010 Connector 70.5 % 72.5 % 72.4 % Custom & Electrical 29.5 27.5 27.5 Corporate & Other 0.1 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % We sell our products directly to OEMs and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through distributors worldwide. Many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries. In fiscal 2012, 60.0% of our net revenue was derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region, representing slower net revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region and a decrease from 61.3% of net revenue in fiscal 2011. In prior years, we experienced faster net revenue growth in Asia, particularly in China, than in the Americas and Europe. We continue to expand our manufacturing operations in lower cost regions. Approximately 56.9% of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as China, Eastern Europe and Mexico. In addition, reduced trade barriers and improved supply chain logistics have reduced our need to duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities. For these reasons, we have consolidated multiple plants of modest size and established a strategy of operating fewer, larger and more integrated facilities in select locations. We believe that our business is positioned to benefit from this strategy. Business Environment The market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors. We are one of the 28 Table of Contents worlds largest manufacturers of electronic connectors. We believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us. Our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop, often in collaboration with our customers. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. Our financial results may be influenced by the following factors: our ability to successfully execute our business strategy; competition for customers; raw material prices; product and price competition; economic conditions in various geographic regions; foreign currency exchange rates; interest rates; changes in technology; fluctuations in customer demand; patent and intellectual property issues; availability of credit and general market liquidity; natural disasters; litigation results; investigations and legal proceedings and regulatory developments. Our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges, including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate manufacturing to such demand, manage volatile raw material costs, develop, manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines, control operating costs, and attract, motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational, financial and management information systems. Our sales are also dependent on end markets impacted by consumer, industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in these end markets. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net revenue growth, which is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis, is a non GAAP financial measure. The tables presented in Results of Operations provide reconciliations of U.S. GAAP reported net revenue growth (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to organic net revenue growth. We believe organic net revenue growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net revenue growth to monitor and evaluate performance, since it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition activity. Management uses organic net revenue growth together with GAAP measures, such as net revenue and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. Because organic net revenue growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similar measures of other companies. Unauthorized Activities in Japan As we previously reported in our fiscal 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities at Molex Japan Co., Ltd. in April 2010. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japans finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japans name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japans name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japans accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation has been completed. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment. As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended June 30, 2010, based on the results of the completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued 29 Table of Contents liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters including the legal proceedings reported in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010. The accrued liability for these unauthorized activities was $184.2 million as of June 30, 2012, including $18.4 million in cumulative foreign currency translation, which was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the unauthorized loans ($165.8 million), we would recognize a gain. In addition, we have a contingent liability of $58.1 million for other loan related expenses, interest expense and delay damages on the outstanding unauthorized loans. Unauthorized activities in Japan for fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 represent investigative and legal fees. Financial Highlights Net revenue and income from operations for fiscal 2012 decreased slightly compared with fiscal 2011 due primarily to global economic uncertainty and lower end customer demand. Net revenue for fiscal 2012 of $3.5 billion decreased $98.1 million, or 2.8%, from fiscal 2011. Organic net revenue decreased $168.4 million, or 4.7%, in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. Income from operations for fiscal 2012 of $399.5 million decreased $30.7 million, or 7.1%, compared with fiscal 2011. We recognized net income of $281.4 million in fiscal 2012 compared with net income of $298.8 million in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 results include a net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan of $11.3 million ($7.2 million after tax). Fiscal 2011 results include a net loss on unauthorized activities in Japan of $14.5 million ($9.2 million after tax). Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue (dollars in thousands): 2012 Percentage ofNet Revenue 2011 Percentage ofNet Revenue 2010 Percentage ofNet Revenue Net revenue $ 3,489,189 100.0 % $ 3,587,334 100.0 % $ 3,007,207 100.0 % Cost of sales 2,420,726 69.4 % 2,499,197 69.7 % 2,114,584 70.3 % Gross profit 1,068,463 30.6 % 1,088,137 30.3 % 892,623 29.7 % Selling, general & administrative 657,732 18.9 % 643,462 17.9 % 610,784 20.3 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments % % 117,139 3.9 % Unauthorized activities in Japan 11,259 0.3 % 14,476 0.4 % 26,898 0.9 % Goodwill impairments % % % Income from operations 399,472 11.4 % 430,199 12.0 % 137,802 4.6 % Other income (expense), net 795 % (260 ) % (6,313 ) (0.2 )% Income before income taxes 400,267 11.5 % 429,939 12.0 % 131,489 4.4 % Income taxes 118,890 3.4 % 131,131 3.7 % 54,559 1.8 % Net income $ 281,377 8.1 % $ 298,808 8.3 % $ 76,930 2.6 % 30 Table of Contents Net Revenue The following table provides an analysis of the change in net revenue compared with the prior fiscal year (in thousands): 2012 2011 Net revenue for prior year $ 3,587,334 $ 3,007,207 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue change (168,385 ) 488,123 Currency translation 57,777 82,742 Acquisitions 12,463 9,262 Total change in net revenue from prior year (98,145 ) 580,127 Net revenue for current year $ 3,489,189 $ 3,587,334 Organic net revenue change as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (4.7 )% 16.2 % Net revenue decreased during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 as end customer demand slowed due to global economic uncertainties. The decrease in net revenue was partially offset by currency translation due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies except the euro. We completed asset acquisitions of a specialty wire and cable company during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and an active optical cable business during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase in net revenue attributed to currency translation in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was principally due to a stronger Japanese yen and weaker U.S. dollar against most currencies except the euro. The following tables show the effect on the change in geographic net revenue from foreign currency translations to the U.S. dollar (in thousands): June 30, 2012 June 30, 2011 LocalCurrency CurrencyTranslation NetChange LocalCurrency CurrencyTranslation NetChange Americas $ 40,202 $ 157 $ 40,359 $ 136,321 $ 1,073 $ 137,394 Asia Pacific (160,831 ) 58,963 (101,868 ) 301,824 96,776 398,600 Europe (34,758 ) (1,343 ) (36,101 ) 59,427 (15,107 ) 44,320 Corporate & Other (535 ) (535 ) (187 ) (187 ) Net change $ (155,922 ) $ 57,777 $ (98,145 ) $ 497,385 $ 82,742 $ 580,127 The change in net revenue by geographic region on a local currency basis as of June 30 follows: 2012 2011 Americas 4.6 % 18.5 % Asia Pacific (7.3 ) 21.0 Europe (6.7 ) 12.5 Total (4.3 )% 16.5 % Net revenue declined in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to the Asia Pacific and Europe regions. Slower economic growth in China and uncertainties about economic stability in Europe led to net revenue declines in those regions during fiscal 2012. In prior years, we experienced faster net revenue growth in Asia, particularly China, than the other regions. Net revenue in fiscal 2011 increased in all three regions compared with fiscal 2010 as overall customer demand improved over the prior year. Net revenue in fiscal 2012 declined compared with fiscal 2011 as global economic uncertainty affected end demand, particularly in our consumer, telecommunications and industrial markets, and 31 Table of Contents our customers managed inventory lower. The decline in net revenue in fiscal 2012 was partially offset by increased demand in our infotech and automotive markets. Net revenue increased across all five primary markets in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 as customer demand improved over the prior year. The following table sets forth, for fiscal 2012 and 2011, changes in net revenue from each of our five primary product markets from the prior fiscal year: 2012 2011 Telecommunications (10 )% 21 % Infotech 5 24 Consumer (6 ) 12 Industrial (9 ) 23 Automotive 7 16 Telecommunications market net revenue decreased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to decreases in demand for certain mobile products, partially offset by increased infrastructure spending on networking. Telecommunications market net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 due to higher infrastructure spending and increased demand for mobile products, including higher demand for smartphones and our customers introduction of smartphone models with higher connector content. Infotech market net revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to increased content and demand for tablet devices and servers, partially offset by slower demand for notebook computers. Infotech market net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased content and demand for servers, data storage, notebook computers and tablet devices. Consumer market net revenue decreased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to economic uncertainty leading to lower demand in home entertainment, including lower demand for our components in televisions, and supply chain disruptions caused by the floods in Thailand during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Decreases in consumer market net revenue were partially offset by increased net revenue in gaming equipment. Consumer market net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased demand for our components in televisions, digital cameras and home appliances, as well as expansion into the non connector audio accessories market, partially offset by reduced demand in gaming equipment. Industrial market net revenue decreased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to softening demand for semiconductor and production equipment from our customers decreased production, companies reluctance to invest in automation projects or deferral of projects in the current economic environment and relatively high levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Industrial market net revenue in fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to higher demand for our connectors in semiconductor and other production equipment as our customers increased production to meet demand. Automotive market net revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to higher global automobile production, particularly in North America and Japan, and increasing electronic content in automobiles, such as navigational and entertainment systems, mobile communication and products to improve fuel efficiency. Automotive market net revenue for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to increased automobile production levels in the United States and China. Gross Profit We measure gross profit as net revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, such as materials, direct and indirect labor, and factory overhead. Our gross margins are primarily affected by the following factors: product mix; volume; cost reduction efforts; competitive pricing pressure; commodity costs and currency fluctuations. 32 Table of Contents The following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Gross profit $ 1,068,463 $ 1,088,137 $ 892,623 Gross margin 30.6 % 30.3 % 29.7 % The decrease in gross profit during fiscal 2012 was due to lower net revenue. Despite the lower net revenue, gross margin improved during fiscal 2012 due to a favorable mix of product sales and rigorous control over costs, including reduced freight expense. The increase in gross profit and gross margin during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increased net revenue. Gross margins have improved over time due to lower costs resulting from our restructuring program. The improvements in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of price erosion and material price increases. A significant portion of our material cost consists of copper and gold costs. We purchased approximately 20 million pounds of copper and 108,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2012 compared with approximately 22 million pounds of copper and 125,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2011 and approximately 23 million pounds of copper and 112,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2010. The following table sets forth the average prices of copper and gold we purchased in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010: 2012 2011 2010 Copper (price per pound) $ 3.73 $ 3.88 $ 3.04 Gold (price per troy ounce) 1,670.00 1,363.00 1,096.00 Generally, we are able to pass through to our customers only a small a portion of the changes in the cost of copper and gold. However, we mitigated the impact of the change in copper and gold prices by hedging with call options a portion of our projected net global purchases of copper and gold. The hedges reduced cost of sales by $6.7 million, $7.1 million and $5.1 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition to commodity costs, the following table sets forth, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 the effects of certain significant impacts on gross profit from the prior year (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Price erosion $ (66,270 ) $ (102,563 ) $ (139,232 ) Currency translation 21,951 37,958 23,928 Currency transaction (35,099 ) (57,763 ) (22,076 ) Price erosion measures the reduction in prices of our products year over year, which reduces our gross profit. Price erosion as a percent of net revenue was 1.9%, 2.8% and 4.5% in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Price erosion decreased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 compared with the prior year periods due primarily to the implementation of pricing software that provides enhanced visibility to recoverable costs and improved detail of profit margin by product. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies except the euro. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen against other currencies and a weaker U.S. dollar against most currencies except the euro. The increase in gross profit due to currency translation gains in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger Asian currencies. Certain products we manufacture in Japan and Europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates may affect our cost of sales reported in U.S. dollars without a corresponding 33 Table of Contents effect on net revenue. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2012 and 2011 was primarily due to a stronger Japanese yen and a weaker U.S. dollar against most currencies. The decrease in gross profit due to currency transactions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a general weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies except the euro. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Selling, general & administrative $ 657,732 $ 643,462 $ 610,784 Selling, general & administrative as a percentage of net revenue 18.9 % 17.9 % 20.3 % Restructuring costs and asset impairments 117,139 Unauthorized activities in Japan 11,259 14,476 26,898 Selling, General & Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $14.3 million and $32.7 million in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 compared with the prior year periods, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to foreign currency translation and investments in research and development to penetrate new markets, acquire new customers and drive future growth. The impact of currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $9.0 million for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $12.7 million for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 were reduced by $8.0 million for property insurance proceeds for damages from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to efforts to control spending as net revenue increased from the prior year. Research and development expenditures, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses, were $181.1 million, or 5.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2012 compared with $170.1 million, or 4.7% of net revenue, for fiscal 2011 and $154.0 million, or 5.1% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010. Research and development expense increased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 compared with the prior year periods as we made strategic investments in developing future technology innovations. Restructuring Costs and Asset Impairments Restructuring costs and asset impairments consist of the following (in thousands): 2010 Severance costs $ 79,609 Asset impairments 37,296 Restructuring costs 116,905 Intangible asset impairments 234 Total restructuring charges and asset impairments $ 117,139 During fiscal 2007, we undertook a multi year restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital in connection with a new global organization that was effective July 1, 2007. A majority of the plan related to facilities located in North America, Europe and Japan and, in general, the movement of manufacturing activities at these plants to other lower cost facilities. We completed our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. 34 Table of Contents In fiscal 2010, we recognized net restructuring costs related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 1,000 employees, resulting in a charge of $79.6 million. A large part of these employee terminations resulted from plant closings in Europe. We recognized asset impairment charges of $37.3 million to write down assets to fair value less the cost to sell. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. For additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Unauthorized Activities in Japan Unauthorized activities in Japan for fiscal 2012 and 2011 represent investigative and legal fees. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting treatment of the accrual for unauthorized activities in Japan. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense) consists primarily of net interest expense, investment income, and currency exchange gains or losses. We recorded other income of $0.8 million during fiscal 2012 compared with $0.3 million of other expense during fiscal 2011. Fluctuations in other income (expense) are primarily due to changes in currency gains and losses. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended June 30, follows: 2012 2011 2010 Effective tax rate 29.7 % 30.5 % 41.5 % The effective tax rate was 29.7%, 30.5% and 41.5% for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher than fiscal 2012 and 2011 due to (1) income tax expense recorded during the year of $7.7 million, due primarily to the reversal of an estimated tax benefit resulting from a significant number of employee stock options that expired unexercised, (2) a charge due to legislation passed during fiscal 2010 which includes a provision that reduces the deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of retiree prescription drug benefits to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, (3) tax losses generated in non U.S. jurisdictions for which no tax benefit has been recognized, and (4) additional U.S. tax cost to repatriate earnings from non US subsidiaries during the year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We had net deferred tax assets of $160.8 million at June 30, 2012. Results by Product Segment Connector. The following table sets forth the change in net revenue for the Connector segment for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 Net revenue for prior year $ 2,600,469 $ 2,177,014 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue change (194,483 ) 350,905 Currency translation 53,983 72,550 Total change in net revenue from prior year (140,500 ) 423,455 Net revenue for current year $ 2,459,969 $ 2,600,469 Organic net revenue change as a percentage of net revenue for prior year (7.5 )% 16.1 % 35 Table of Contents The Connector segment sells primarily to the telecommunications, infotech, consumer and automotive markets, which are discussed above. Segment organic net revenue decreased during fiscal 2012 compared with the prior year period due to slower customer demand, particularly in the telecommunications and consumer markets, partially offset by increased net revenue in the automotive market. Segment organic net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with the prior year periods due to increased demand in all of the Connector segments primary markets, partially offset by price erosion. Price erosion, which is generally higher in the Connector segment compared with our other segments, was 2.9% and 3.3% in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table sets forth information on income from operations and operating margins for the Connector segment for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Income from operations $ 344,387 $ 396,233 $ 123,980 Operating margin 14.0 % 15.2 % 5.7 % Connector segment income from operations declined in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower net revenue and higher gold and resin costs. We adjusted prices to partially offset rising material costs and minimize the impact of price erosion on gross profit and gross margin. Lower production levels due to decreasing customer demand also led to lower absorption of our fixed costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 were consistent with fiscal 2011 as insurance proceeds for damages related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan principally offset increases in investments in research and development and foreign currency translation. Foreign currency translation increased selling, general and administrative expenses $14.6 million during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies except the euro. Connector segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased net revenue and completion of our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. Gross margins were positively impacted from lower costs from our restructuring program, which has improved margins over time. Connector segment income from operations also improved in fiscal 2011 due to controlled selling, general and administrative costs in a period of increased net revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $368.4 million, or 14.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2011 compared with $347.6 million, or 16.0% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010, due to efficiencies gained from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Custom & Electrical. The following table sets forth net revenue for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 Net revenue for prior year $ 985,120 $ 828,905 Components of net revenue increase: Organic net revenue change 26,774 136,757 Currency translation 3,783 10,196 Acquisitions 12,463 9,262 Total change in net revenue from prior year 43,020 156,215 Net revenue for current year $ 1,028,140 $ 985,120 Organic net revenue change growth as a percentage of net revenue for prior year 2.7 % 16.5 % The Custom & Electrical segment sells primarily to the industrial, telecommunications and infotech markets. Custom & Electrical segment net revenue exceeded $1.0 billion in fiscal 2012 and organic net revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to increased demand in the infotech market. Segment organic net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 due to 36 Table of Contents increased demand in all of the segments primary markets. We completed asset acquisitions of a specialty wire and cable company during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and an active optical cable business during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The following table sets forth income from operations and operating margins for the Custom & Electrical segment for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Income from operations $ 172,803 $ 154,370 $ 111,083 Operating margin 16.8 % 15.7 % 13.4 % Custom & Electrical segment income from operations increased during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 due to increased net revenue, favorable mix of product sales and higher absorption, partially offset by increased investments in our global sales and marketing organization and research and development to penetrate new markets, acquire customers and drive future growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of net revenue in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 as costs were controlled despite the increase in net revenue. Custom & Electrical segment income from operations increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased net revenue and completion of our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. Gross margins were positively impacted from lower costs from our restructuring program, which has improved margins over time. Income from operations also improved in fiscal 2011 due to controlled selling, general and administrative costs in a period of increased net revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $169.6 million, or 17.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2011 compared with $168.5 million, or 20.2% of net revenue, for fiscal 2010, due to efficiencies gained from restructuring and specific cost containment actions. Financial Condition and Liquidity We fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $652.2 million and $546.5 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2012 included approximately $617.9 million in non U.S. accounts, including $209.1 million in countries where we may experience administrative delays in withdrawing and transferring cash to U.S. accounts. Transferring cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities to U.S. accounts from non U.S. accounts could subject us to additional U.S. repatriation income tax. The primary source of our cash flow is generated by operations. Principal uses of cash are capital expenditures, dividend payments and business investments. Our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant, equipment and acquisitions. On August 18, 2011, we issued senior notes totaling $150.0 million through a private placement of debt (the Private Placement). The Private Placement consists of three $50.0 million series notes: Series A with an interest rate of 2.91% matures on August 18, 2016; Series B with an interest rate of 3.59% matures on August 18, 2018; and Series C with an interest rate of 4.28% matures on August 18, 2021. The Note Purchase Agreement requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage and interest rate coverage. As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants. In June 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million unsecured, three year revolving credit facility in the United States that was initially scheduled to mature in June 2012 (the U.S. Credit Facility). We amended the U.S. Credit Facility in January 2010, September 2010 and March 2011. In connection with the September 2010 amendment, we increased the credit line on the U.S. Credit Facility to $270.0 million. In March 2011, we amended the credit facility to increase the credit line to $350.0 million and extend the term to March 2016. Total debt, including obligations under capital leases totaled $255.0 million and $342.6 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We had available lines of credit totaling $444.4 million at 37 Table of Contents June 30, 2012, including $350.0 million available under the U.S. Credit Facility as of June 30, 2012. The U.S. Credit Facility also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage. As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, we have three unsecured borrowing agreements in Japan totaling &yen;8.0 billion ($100.2 million) as of June 30, 2012, with weighted average fixed interest rates of 1.8%. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows Below is a table setting forth the key lines of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Cash provided from operating activities $ 573,719 $ 466,151 $ 250,579 Cash used for investing activities (227,695 ) (270,709 ) (216,871 ) Cash used for financing activities (226,282 ) (77,191 ) (83,236 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (14,924 ) 37,996 1,173 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 104,818 $ 156,247 $ (48,355 ) Operating Activities Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2012 increased by $107.6 million from the prior year due primarily to a $144.5 million decrease in working capital needs in fiscal 2012 as receivables decreased due to improved collections and lower net revenue. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Net inventory levels were controlled, but increased slightly from fiscal 2011 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2011 increased $215.6 million from fiscal 2010 due primarily to an increase in net income in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and completion of our restructuring program on June 30, 2010. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities decreased by $43.0 million due to decreased investment in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, $11.0 million of proceeds from the sale of an investment during fiscal 2012 and $8.0 million of insurance proceeds for damages from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The decrease was partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2012 compared with net sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures decreased $35.1 million during fiscal 2012 due to project delays related to lower demand and production. Capital expenditures increased $32.8 million during fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 as demand and production increased. We had $2.4 million in net purchases of marketable securities during fiscal 2012 compared with $3.6 million in net sales of marketable securities during fiscal 2011. We had $25.5 million net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2010. Our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year. Our investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating, other investing and financing activities. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities increased $149.1 million during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to net payments on the revolving credit facility and long term debt compared with net borrowings in fiscal 2011 and an increase in quarterly cash dividends paid during fiscal 2012. 38 Table of Contents We issued senior notes totaling $150.0 million in fiscal 2012. Proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our $350.0 million unsecured, five year revolving U.S. Credit Facility. Net payments against the U.S. Credit Facility during the twelve months ended June 30, 2012 were $185.0 million compared to net borrowings of $85.0 million in the prior year period. There were no outstanding borrowings against the U.S. Credit Facility as of June 30, 2012. We increased our cash dividend during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to $0.20 per share, an increase of 14.3% from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share. The increase was effective to shareholders of record on June 30, 2011. During fiscal 2011, we increased our quarterly cash dividend to $0.175 per share, an increase of 14.8% from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.1525 per share in fiscal 2010. The increase was effective to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010. Additionally, we increased our cash dividend again during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 to $0.22 per share, which was effective to shareholders of record on June 30, 2012. Sources of Liquidity We believe we have sufficient cash balances, cash flow and available credit lines to support our planned growth. As part of our growth strategy, we may, in the future, acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, and pursue other business ventures. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may affect our cash requirements and debt balances. To the extent we are required to pay all or any portion of the unauthorized loans in Molex Japan, our cash requirements may also be affected. Total debt consisted of the following at June 30: AverageInterestRate CalendarYearMaturity 2012 2011 Long term debt: Private Placement 2.91 4.28 % 2016 2021 $ 150,000 $ U.S. Credit Facility 1.75 % 2016 185,000 Unsecured bonds and term loans 1.31 1.65 % 2012 2013 37,556 89,342 Mortgages, industrial development bonds and other debt Varies 2012 2013 1,091 1,528 Total long term debt 188,647 275,870 Less current portion of long term debt: Unsecured bonds and term loans 1.31 1.65 % 37,556 52,156 Mortgages, industrial development bonds and other debt Varies 1,059 920 Long term debt, less current portion 150,032 222,794 Short term borrowings Overdraft loan 1.98 % 2012 62,645 62,060 Other short term borrowings Varies 3,673 4,628 Total short term borrowings 66,318 66,688 Total debt $ 254,965 $ 342,558 On August 18, 2011, we issued senior notes totaling $150.0 million through an unregistered, private placement of debt (the Private Placement). The Private Placement consists of three $50.0 million series notes: Series A with an interest rate of 2.91% matures on August 18, 2016; Series B with an interest rate of 3.59% matures on August 18, 2018; and Series C with an interest rate of 4.28% matures on August 18, 2021. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary covenants regarding 39 Table of Contents liens, debt, substantial asset sales and mergers. The Note Purchase Agreement also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage and interest rate coverage. As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants and the balance of the senior notes was $150.0 million. In June 2009, we entered into a $195.0 million unsecured, three year revolving credit facility in the United States, amended in January 2010, September 2010 and March 2011, that was initially scheduled to mature in June 2012 (the U.S. Credit Facility). In connection with the September 2010 amendment, we increased the credit line on the U.S. Credit Facility to $270.0 million. In March 2011, we further amended the U.S. Credit Facility to increase the credit line to $350.0 million and extend the term to March 2016. Borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate (based on London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 150 basis points as of June 30, 2012. The instrument governing the U.S. Credit Facility contains customary covenants regarding liens, debt, substantial asset sales and mergers, dividends and investments. The U.S. Credit Facility also requires us to maintain financial covenants pertaining to, among other things, our consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage. As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants and had no outstanding borrowings. In March 2012, Molex Japan renewed a &yen;5.0 billion overdraft loan, with a six month term and an interest rate of approximately 1.98%. At June 30, 2012, the balance of the overdraft loan, which requires full repayment by the end of the term if not renewed, approximated $62.6 million. In March 2010, Molex Japan entered into a &yen;3.0 billion syndicated term loan for three years, with interest rates equivalent to six month Tokyo InterBank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus 75 basis points and scheduled principal payments of &yen;0.5 billion every six months (Syndicated Term Loan). At June 30, 2012, the balance of the syndicated term loan approximated $12.5 million, which is classified as current. In September 2009, Molex Japan issued unsecured bonds totaling &yen;10.0 billion with a term of three years, an interest rate of approximately 1.65% and scheduled principal payments of &yen;1.6 billion every six months. At June 30, 2012, the outstanding balance of the unsecured bonds approximated $25.1 million, which is classified as current. Certain assets, including land, buildings and equipment, secure a portion of our long term debt. Principal payments on long term debt obligations are due as follows as of June 30, 2012 (in thousands): Year one $ 38,615 Year two 32 Year three Year four Year five 50,000 Thereafter 100,000 Total long term debt obligations $ 188,647 We had available lines of credit totaling $444.4 million at June 30, 2012, including $350.0 million available on the U.S. Credit Facility. The lines of credit expire between 2012 and 2016. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2012, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands): Total Less Than1 Year 1 3Years 4 5Years More Than5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 40,711 $ 16,017 $ 15,452 $ 7,384 $ 1,858 Capital lease obligations 7,990 4,156 3,764 70 Other long term liabilities 15,879 3,370 3,944 9 8,556 Debt obligations(1) 250,809 100,777 32 50,000 100,000 Total $ 315,389 $ 124,320 $ 23,192 $ 57,463 $ 110,414 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities for certain purchase obligations, as discussed below. Debt obligations do not include interest payments. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months. Agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, and are therefore not included in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 10, Revenue Recognition, as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. We recognize net revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer. Contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an 41 Table of Contents arrangement. Shipping documents, proof of delivery and customer acceptance (when applicable) are used to verify delivery. We assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer, including, but not limited to, the payment terms associated with the transaction. The impact of judgments and estimates on net revenue recognition is minimal. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of net revenue. Income Taxes We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within ASC 740 10, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. We have net deferred tax assets of $160.8 million at June 30, 2012. We periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made. We have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non U.S. net operating losses. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately $50.3 million at June 30, 2012. We have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations, evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes. Although we believe our tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters. Subsidiaries with historical net operating losses were able to utilize $23.5 million of these losses during fiscal 2012. Provision is made for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market value. FIFO inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess. The allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product, open sales orders and future sales forecasts. If our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results. Such factors require judgment, and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance. 42 Table of Contents Pension Plans The costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions. The three critical assumptions used, all of which impact the net periodic pension expense (income) and two of which impact the pension benefit obligation (PBO), are the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments. The discount rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each years expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for U.S. pension obligations. The discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by using a yield curve approach or by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets. In those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. The expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets. We have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios. The rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans. These key assumptions are evaluated annually. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. For additional information concerning the assumptions see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of June 30, 2012, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses, is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease)in PBO Increase (Decrease)in Pension Expense U.S. Plan Intl Plans U.S. Plan Intl Plans Discount rate change: Increase 50 basis points $ (6,510 ) $ (11,684 ) $ 17 $ (143 ) Decrease 50 basis points 7,343 13,211 (35 ) 114 Expected rate of return change: Increase 100 basis points N/A N/A 704 753 Decrease 100 basis points N/A N/A (704 ) (753 ) Other Postretirement Benefits We have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees. There are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the US. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and retiree health care benefit expense. The effects of the indicated increase and decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates for our retiree healthcare plans as of June 30, 2012, assuming no change in benefit levels is shown below (in thousands): Increase (Decrease)Total Annual Serviceand Interest Cost Increase (Decrease)in APBO Increase 100 basis points: $ 589 $ 4,534 Decrease 100 basis points: (481 ) (3,736 ) Stock Options We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock. We 43 Table of Contents estimate the expected life of the option using historical data pertaining to option exercises. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as of June 30, 2012 (in thousands): TotalMeasuredat FairValue Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Available for sale and trading securities $ 29,651 $ 29,651 $ $ Derivative financial instruments, net 7,029 7,029 We determine the fair value of our available for sale securities based on quoted market prices (Level 1). We generally use derivatives for hedging purposes pursuant to ASC 815 10, which are valued based on Level 2 inputs in the ASC 820 10 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our financial instruments is determined by a mark to market valuation based on forward curves using observable market prices. The carrying value of our long term debt approximates fair value. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value. Our impairment review process compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment. The expected future cash flows are generally based on managements estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand, net revenue and margins, changes in competition, operating costs and new products introduced. In determining fair value, we make certain judgments. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Although we believe our assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable, changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation. Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) For available for sale securities, we presume an OTTI decline in value if the quoted market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a continuous period of six months or more. However, the presumption of an OTTI decline in value may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we evaluate all known quantitative and qualitative factors in addition to quoted market 44 Table of Contents prices in determining whether an OTTI decline in value exists. Factors that we consider important in evaluating for a potential OTTI, include historical operating performance, future financial projections, business plans for new products or concepts and strength of balance sheet. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with ASC 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we assess the impairment of long lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, including property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. Contingencies In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, we analyze whether it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue for costs associated with the loss contingency. We expense associated legal fees as incurred. If no accrual is made but the loss contingency is reasonably possible, we disclose the nature of the contingency and the related estimate of possible loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made. Loss contingencies include, but are not limited to, possible losses related to legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters. Liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops, circumstances change, or contingencies are resolved. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). This new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for us for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 and will amend our presentation of the components of comprehensive income. In July 2012, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of intangible assets for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test as required under current guidance. This new guidance is effective for us beginning July 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve. This creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency limiting the need to hedge with a 45 Table of Contents foreign exchange forward or option contract (collectively, foreign exchange contracts). Natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate, although the percentage of natural offsets, as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts, will vary from country to country. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. Examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system, the establishment of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries, development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the foreign exchange contracts in use at June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. We have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments. Under the policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows, net receivable and payable balances and call options on certain commodities. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the derivative instruments in use at June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The translation of the financial statements of the non North American operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated net revenue and income from operations were impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulting in increased net revenue of $57.8 million and increased income from operations of $12.9 million for fiscal 2012, compared with the estimated results for fiscal 2011 using the average rates for 2011. Our $14.8 million of marketable securities at June 30, 2012 are principally invested in time deposits. Interest rate exposure is generally limited to our marketable securities, U.S. Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Our marketable securities mature in less than 12 months. We had no outstanding borrowings on the U.S. Credit Facility with an interest rate of approximately 1.75% at June 30, 2012. The balance of our Syndicated Term Loan was approximately $12.5 million with an interest rate of approximately 1.31% at June 30, 2012. Due to the nature of our operations, net revenue from specific customers or products fluctuates over time, but our broad base of customers in several markets mitigates the concentration risk relating to any one customer or product. Approximately 32% and 14% of net revenue in fiscal 2012 was derived from operations from China and Japan, respectively. We monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations. 46 Table of Contents
