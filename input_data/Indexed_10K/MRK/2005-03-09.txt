Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of the Company: Schering Plough (the Company) discovers, develops, manufactures and markets medical therapies and treatments to enhance human health. The Company also markets leading consumer brands in the over the counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and operates a global animal health business. As a research based pharmaceutical company, Schering Ploughs core strategy is to invest substantial amounts of funds in scientific research with the goal of creating important medical and commercial value. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. There is a high rate of failure inherent in such research and, as a result, there is a high risk that the funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to the commercial phase may take a decade or more. Because of the high risk nature of research investments, financial resources typically must come from internal sources (operations and cash reserves) or from equity type capital. There are two sources of new products: products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements, and products in the Companys late stage research pipeline. With respect to acquisitions and licensing, there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late stage products, and these limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding. The Company competes for these opportunities against companies often with far greater financial resources than that of the Company. Due to the present financial situation, it may be challenging for the Company to acquire or license critical late stage products that will have a positive material financial impact. During the past three years, the Company experienced a number of negative events that have strained and continue to strain the Companys financial resources. These negative events included, but were not limited to, the following matters: Entered into a formal consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 and agreed to revalidate manufacturing processes at certain manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Significant increased spending associated with manufacturing compliance efforts will continue through the completion of the FDA consent decree obligation. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain older profitable products and outsource other products. Switch of CLARITIN in the U.S., beginning in December 2002 from prescription to OTC status. This switch coupled with private label competition has resulted in a much lower average unit selling price for this product and ongoing intense competition. The Companys exposure to powerful retail purchasers has also increased. Market shares and sales levels of certain other Company products have fallen significantly and have experienced increased competition. Many of these products compete in declining or volatile markets. Investigations into certain of the Companys sales and marketing practices by the U.S. Attorneys Offices in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. During 2004 the Company made payments totaling $294 million to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in settlement of that investigation. The Massachusetts investigation is continuing and poses significant financial and commercial risks to the Company. In response to these matters, beginning in April 2003 the Company appointed a new management team that formulated, and has begun to implement, a six to eight year Action Agenda to stabilize, repair and then turn around the Company. The Company intends to avail itself of the foreign earnings repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Under this Act the Company intends to repatriate $9.4 billion of unremitted foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate. This repatriation of funds will provide the Company with greater financial stability. 22 Table of Contents Current State of the Business: For the past two years the Companys earnings and cash flow have declined significantly. The overriding cause of this is the loss of marketing exclusivity for two of the Companys major pharmaceutical products, CLARITIN and REBETOL as well as increased competition in the hepatitis C market. Sales and marketing costs have increased due to the need to reinvest in these functions to launch new products as well as a need to stabilize market shares of the Companys remaining pharmaceutical products. Many of the Companys manufacturing sites operate well below optimum production levels due to sales declines and the reduction in output related to the FDA consent decree. At the same time, overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the consent decree and other compliance activities. The Company continues to review the carrying value of these assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and or related costs. The Company continues to pursue its core strategy of supporting its marketed and new products in its research and development pipeline and plans to invest in sales and marketing and scientific research at historical levels. However, this level of investment is not sustainable without a significant increase in profits and cash flow from operations. The ability of the Company to generate profits and significant operating cash flow is directly and predominantly dependent upon the increasing profitability of the Companys cholesterol franchise (which includes VYTORIN and ZETIA) and to a much lesser extent growing sales and profitability of the base pharmaceutical business products, developing or acquiring new products and controlling expenses. If the Company cannot generate significant operating cash flow, its ability to invest in sales, marketing and research efforts at historical levels may be negatively impacted. ZETIA is the Companys novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor, Mercks statin medication. These two products have been launched through a joint venture between the Company and Merck. The cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical market in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are well positioned in this market, but these products compete against other and well established cholesterol management products marketed by companies with financial resources much greater than that of the Company. The financial commitment to compete in this market is shared with Merck and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. Management cannot provide assurance that profits in the near term will be sufficient for the Company to maintain its core marketing and research strategies. If a sufficient level of profit and cash flow cannot be achieved, the Company would need to evaluate strategic alternatives. With regard to an examination of strategic alternatives, the contracts with Merck for VYTORIN and ZETIA and the contract with Centocor, Inc. for REMICADE (exhibits 10 (r) and 10 (u), respectively, to the Companys 2003 Form 10 K) contain provisions related to a change of control, as defined in those contracts. These provisions could result in the aforementioned products being acquired by Merck or reverting back to Centocor, Inc. Regulatory Environment in which the Company Operates: Government regulatory agencies throughout the world regulate the Companys discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts. The FDA is a central regulator of the Companys business. Since 2001, the Company has been working with the FDA to resolve issues involving the Companys compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. In 2002, the Company reached a formal agreement with the FDA to enter into a consent decree. Under the terms of the consent decree, the Company made payments totaling $500 million and agreed to revalidate the manufacturing processes at these sites. These manufacturing sites have remained open throughout this period; however, the consent decree has placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites, including review and third party certification of production activities. The third party certifications and other cGMP improvement projects have resulted in higher costs as well as reduced output at these facilities. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain profitable older products. The Companys research and development operations have also been negatively impacted by the decree because these operations share common facilities with the manufacturing operations. 23 Table of Contents In the U.S., the pricing of the Companys pharmaceutical products are subject to competitive pressure as managed care organizations seek price discounts. Also in the U.S., the Company is required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government funded programs. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Recently, clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. The Company continues to maintain a robust process for monitoring adverse events related to its products around the world. Company personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. On July 30, 2004, Schering Plough Corporation, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced a settlement related to certain of the Companys sales and marketing practices that had been under investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, a subsidiary of Schering Plough Corporation pled guilty to a single federal criminal charge concerning a payment to a managed care customer. In addition, under the settlement, Schering Plough Corporation also entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement (CIA). Failure to comply with the CIA can result in financial penalties. The settlement will not affect the ability of Schering Plough Corporation to participate in federal healthcare programs. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales: Consolidated net sales in 2004 totaled $8.3 billion, a decrease of $62 million or 1 percent compared with 2003. Consolidated net sales reflected primarily volume declines offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 4 percent. Consolidated 2003 net sales of $8.3 billion decreased $1.8 billion or 18 percent versus 2002, reflecting primarily volume declines offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 5 percent. 24 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 (Dollars in millions) Prescription Pharmaceuticals $ 6,417 $ 6,611 $ 8,745 (3 )% (24 )% Remicade 746 540 337 38 60 Clarinex/ Aerius 692 694 598 0 16 Nasonex 594 500 523 19 (4 ) PEG Intron 563 802 1,015 (30 ) (21 ) Temodar 459 324 278 42 16 Integrilin 325 306 304 6 1 Claritin Rx(a) 321 328 1,802 (2 ) (82 ) Intron A 318 409 533 (22 ) (23 ) Rebetol 287 639 1,222 (55 ) (48 ) Subutex 185 144 103 29 40 Elocon 168 154 165 9 (7 ) Caelyx 150 111 71 35 55 Other Pharmaceutical 1,609 1,660 1,794 (3 ) (7 ) Consumer Health Care 1,085 1,026 758 6 35 OTC(b) 578 588 275 (2 ) N/M Foot Care 331 292 290 13 1 Sun Care 176 146 193 20 (24 ) Animal Health 770 697 677 10 3 Consolidated net sales $ 8,272 $ 8,334 $ 10,180 (1 )% (18 )% Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. N/ M Not a meaningful percentage. (a) Amounts shown for 2004 and 2003 include international sales of CLARITIN Rx only. (b) Includes OTC CLARITIN of $419, $432 and $105 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. International net sales of REMICADE, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease and ankylosing spondylitis, were up $206 million or 38 percent in 2004 to $746 million due to greater medical use and expanded indications in European markets. Sales of REMICADE in 2003 were $540 million, up $203 million or 60 percent compared with 2002, primarily in Europe, due to increased patient utilization. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.) for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year round indoor allergies were $692 million for 2004, essentially flat versus 2003. Sales outside the U.S. increased 39 percent to $272 million in 2004 due to market share gains and continued conversion from prescription CLARITIN. U.S. sales decreased 16 percent to $420 million in 2004 due to the continued contraction in the U.S. prescription antihistamine market following the launch of OTC CLARITIN and other branded and non branded nonsedating antihistamines coupled with market share declines. Global net sales of CLARINEX were $694 million in 2003, an increase of 16 percent compared to $598 million in 2002, reflecting the continued conversion of patients from prescription CLARITIN, coupled with the launch of CLARINEX in several international markets. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 19 percent to $594 million in 2004 primarily due to international sales growth and favorable prior year trade inventory comparisons in the U.S., tempered by a decline in U.S. market share. 2003 sales of NASONEX decreased 4 percent versus 2002 to $500 million due to changes in U.S. trade inventory levels and market share declines in the U.S. 25 Table of Contents Global net sales of PEG INTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, decreased 30 percent to $563 million compared with 2003 due to ongoing market competition in a contracting market. Market share of PEG INTRON has been declining, reflecting the entrance of a competitors new products in the hepatitis C market in 2003. Sales of PEG INTRON decreased $213 million or 21 percent to $802 million in 2003 compared to 2002, due primarily to loss of market share. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 22 percent in 2004 to $318 million due primarily to lower demand. Sales of INTRON A were $409 million in 2003, a decline of 23 percent from 2002 due primarily to loss of market share. Global net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with INTRON A or PEG INTRON for treating hepatitis C, decreased 55 percent to $287 million due to the launch of generic versions of REBETOL in the U.S. in April 2004 and increased price competition outside the U.S. Sales of REBETOL were $639 million in 2003, a decline of 48 percent from $1.2 billion in 2002, due primarily to loss of market share resulting from new branded competition. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, for treating certain types of brain tumors, increased $135 million or 42 percent to $459 million in 2004 due to increased market penetration. Sales of TEMODAR were $324 million in 2003, an increase of 16 percent compared to $278 million in 2002, due to increased market penetration. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold by Schering Plough, primarily in the U.S., increased $19 million or 6 percent to $325 million in 2004 due to increased patient utilization. Sales of INTEGRILIN were $306 million and $304 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Millennium) and the Company have a co promotion agreement for INTEGRILIN. Millennium notified the Company that it intends to exercise its right under the agreement to assume responsibilities for consumer service, managed care contracting, government reporting and physical distribution of INTEGRILIN. As a result, based on the final assumption agreement, as early as the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company may be required to cease the recording of sales of INTEGRILIN and record its share of co promotion profits as alliance revenue. Currently, the Company anticipates that this change in recording sales of INTEGRILIN would have no impact on earnings. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN decreased 2 percent from $328 million in 2003 to $321 million in 2004 due to continued conversion to CLARINEX. In 2002, global sales of prescription CLARITIN were $1.8 billion, reflecting over $1.4 billion of sales in the U.S. prior to its conversion to OTC status. International net sales of SUBUTEX Tablets, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 29 percent to $185 million due to increased market penetration. Sales of SUBUTEX were $144 million in 2003 and $103 million in 2002. SUBUTEX may be vulnerable to generic competition in the future. Global net sales of ELOCON cream, a medium potency topical steroid, increased 9 percent to $168 million. Sales of ELOCON were $154 million in 2003 and $165 million in 2002. Generic competition is expected to affect sales of this product. International sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposis sarcoma, increased 35 percent to $150 million reflecting further adoption of the metastatic breast cancer indication in patients who are at increased cardiac risk. Sales of CAELYX in 2003 increased 55 percent versus 2002 to $111 million, due to increased patient utilization coupled with the launch of the metastatic breast cancer indication. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. The products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. 26 Table of Contents Global net sales of consumer health care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased $59 million or 6 percent in 2004 to $1.1 billion. Net sales of foot care products increased $39 million or 13 percent in 2004 due primarily to the strong performance of DR. SCHOLLS FREEZE AWAY, a new wart remover product. Net sales of sun care products increased $30 million or 20 percent in 2004, primarily due to the timing of orders and shipments. Sales of OTC CLARITIN were $419 million in 2004, a decrease of $13 million or 3 percent from 2003, due to competition from branded and private label loratadine. Net sales of consumer health care products in 2003 increased $268 million or 35 percent compared to 2002, due primarily to increased sales of OTC CLARITIN following its launch in December 2002. Global net sales of animal health products increased 10 percent in 2004 to $770 million. Sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 6 percent. Global net sales of animal health products increased 3 percent in 2003, which were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 7 percent. Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 (Dollars in millions) Cost of sales $ 3,070 $ 2,833 $ 2,505 8 % 13 % % of net sales 37.1 % 34.0 % 24.6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,811 $ 3,474 $ 3,681 10 % (6 %) % of net sales 46.1 % 41.7 % 36.2 % Research and development $ 1,607 $ 1,469 $ 1,425 9 % 3 % % of net sales 19.4 % 17.6 % 14.0 % Other expense (income), net $ 146 $ 59 $ (144 ) N/M N/M % of net sales 1.8 % 0.7 % (1.4 %) Special charges $ 153 $ 599 $ 150 N/M N/M % of net sales 1.8 % 7.2 % 1.5 % Equity income from cholesterol joint venture $ (347 ) $ (54 ) $ N/M N/M N/ M Not a meaningful percentage. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2004 increased over 2003, primarily due to lower production volumes coupled with increased spending related to the FDA consent decree, other manufacturing compliance spending, and efforts to upgrade the Companys global infrastructure. The absence of European LOSEC revenues and a change in product sales mix, including sales of Bayer licensed products, contributed to the unfavorable comparison as well. The Companys base pharmaceutical business is competing in many declining or volatile markets. Sales and the cost of sales of base business products have a direct impact on gross margin. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2003 increased over 2002 due to a change in product sales mix resulting from the loss of U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN, as well as lower production volumes and increased spending for the Companys cGMP compliance efforts. Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in the Companys net sales. The results of the operations of the joint venture are reflected in equity income and have no impact on the Companys gross and other operating margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 10 percent to $3.8 billion in 2004 versus $3.5 billion in 2003 primarily due to the expansion of the sales field force, higher employee related costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower promotional spending. The ratio of SG&A to net sales of 46.1 percent in 2004 was higher than the ratio of 41.7 percent in 2003. SG&A expenses 27 Table of Contents decreased 6 percent to $3.5 billion in 2003 from $3.7 billion in 2002 due to lower pharmaceutical business marketing spending and lower employee related costs. The ratio of SG&A to net sales of 41.7 percent in 2003 was higher than the ratio of 36.2 percent in 2002, primarily due to lower overall sales reported in 2003. Research and development (R&D) spending increased 9 percent to $1.6 billion, representing 19.4 percent of net sales in 2004, and includes an $80 million charge in conjunction with the license from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd. (Toyama) for garenoxacin, a quinolone antibiotic currently in development. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of the Companys funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. In 2004 and 2003, the increase in Other expense (income), net, is primarily the result of higher net interest expense. Other expense (income), net in 2002 included $80 million of income related to the sale of the Companys U.S. marketing rights for SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX sublingual tablets for the treatment of opioid dependence. Special Charges: The components of Special Charges are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Litigation charges $ $ 350 $ 150 Employee termination costs 119 179 Asset impairment and related charges 34 70 $ 153 $ 599 $ 150 Litigation Charges In 2003 and 2002, litigation reserves were increased by $350 million and $150 million, respectively, primarily as a result of the investigations into the Companys sales and marketing practices. Employee Termination Costs In August 2003, the Company announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. Under this program, eligible employees in the U.S. had until December 15, 2003 to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, of which approximately 850 employees retired through year end 2004 and approximately 50 employees have staggered retirement dates in 2005. The total cost of this program is approximately $191 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $108 million, increased post retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of $22 million. For employees with staggered retirement dates in 2005, these amounts will be recognized as a charge over the employees remaining service periods. Amounts recognized in 2004 and 2003 for this program were $20 million and $164 million, respectively. The amount expected to be recognized in 2005 is $7 million. Termination costs not associated with the VERP totaled $99 million and $15 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Asset Impairment and Related Charges The Company recorded asset impairment and related charges of $34 million and $70 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The charge in 2004 relates primarily to the shutdown of a small European research and development facility. 28 Table of Contents The asset impairment and related charges in 2003 were related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, the write down of production equipment related to products that are no longer produced at a manufacturing site operating under the FDA consent decree, the write down of a drug license and a sun care trade name for which expected cash flows did not support the carrying value. Summary of Selected Special Charges The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs and asset impairment and related charges: Employee Asset Impairment Termination and Related Costs Charges (Dollars in millions) Special charges incurred during 2003 $ 179 $ 70 Impairment write downs (70 ) Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (144 ) Disbursements (6 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2003 $ 29 $ Special charges incurred during 2004 $ 119 $ 34 Impairment write downs (27 ) Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (20 ) Disbursements (110 ) (7 ) Special charges liability balance December 31, 2004 $ 18 $ Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture Global cholesterol franchise sales, which include sales made by the Company and the cholesterol joint venture with Merck of VYTORIN and ZETIA, totaled $1.2 billion and $471 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. VYTORIN has been approved in 25 countries and has been launched in several countries, including the U.S. in July 2004. ZETIA has been approved in 72 countries and was launched in the U.S. and over 40 international markets since November 2002. The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting for the joint venture. Sharing of net income is based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. Schering Ploughs allocation of joint venture income is increased by milestones earned. The partners bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the joint venture reimburses each partner for a pre defined amount of physician details that are set on an annual basis. Schering Plough reports the receipt of this reimbursement as part of equity income as under U.S. GAAP this amount does not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs for the Companys detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, this reimbursement amount per physician detail is not reflective of Schering Ploughs joint venture sales force effort as Schering Ploughs sales force related infrastructure costs per physician detail are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the partners contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct to consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out of pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the partners. Equity income from cholesterol joint venture, as defined, totaled $347 million and $54 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 29 Table of Contents During 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized milestones from Merck of $7 million and $20 million, respectively, relating to the approval of ezetimibe/simvastatin in Mexico in 2004 and certain European approvals of ZETIA in 2003. These amounts are included in equity income. Under certain other conditions, as specified in the Merck agreements, Merck could pay additional milestones to the Company totaling $125 million. It should be noted that the Company incurs substantial costs such as selling costs that are not reflected in Equity income from cholesterol joint venture and are borne entirely by the Company. Prior to 2003, the venture was in the research and development phase and the Companys share of research and development expense in 2002 was $69 million and was reported in Research and Development in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. In 2003 and 2004 Research and development costs related to the joint venture are included in equity income. Provision for Income Taxes Tax expense was $779 million, $46 million and $589 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The tax provision in 2004 includes a charge of approximately $417 million (tax charge of $494 million less $77 million in foreign tax credits) related to the intended repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), $174 million in foreign and state taxes and a valuation allowance of approximately $240 million provided against certain deferred tax assets resulting from changes in Company tax planning strategies triggered by the opportunity to take full advantage of the Act. See discussion of the overall impacts of the Act on the Company below. The 2004 tax provision also includes a U.S. Net Operating Loss (U.S. NOL) carryback benefit of approximately $52 million. Net (loss)/ income: Net loss was $947 million in 2004 versus a loss of $92 million in 2003 and net income of $2.0 billion in 2002. Net loss in 2004 includes tax expense of $779 million primarily for the intended repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and a valuation reserve for net deferred tax assets in the U.S. The net loss in 2004 also reflects higher Selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the build up of the U.S. sales force for the VYTORIN launch and the addition of sales representatives as a result of the Bayer licensing agreement as well as pre tax special charges of $153 million, as described above. The 2004 results also include a pre tax research and development charge of $80 million for the license of garenoxacin from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd. Net loss in 2003 includes special charges of $599 million, as described above. Net income in 2002 includes special charges of $150 million to increase litigation reserves. Net loss available to common shareholders: The 2004 net loss available to common shareholders includes the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $34 million related to the issuance of the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August 2004. Impact of the American Jobs Creation Act The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was enacted into law in October 2004. One provision of the Act effectively reduces the tax rate on qualifying repatriation of funds held by foreign based subsidiaries to 5.25 percent. Normally such repatriations would be taxed at a rate of up to 35 percent. To qualify for the reduced tax rate the funds must be repatriated during a one year period and fund qualifying expenditures in the U.S. The amount of funds that can be repatriated at the reduced tax rate is limited to the amount of unremitted foreign earnings reported in the Companys 2002 Annual Report. 30 Table of Contents During 2005, the Company intends to repatriate approximately $9.4 billion under the Act, which is the maximum amount of funds qualifying for the reduced tax rate. This repatriation of funds will trigger a U.S. income tax payment in 2005 of approximately $417 million, net of available tax credits. For financial reporting purposes, this tax payment has been recognized as an expense in 2004. Repatriating funds under the Act will benefit the Company in the following ways: As discussed in more detail in the Liquidity and Financial Resources section, the Companys U.S. operations incur significant negative cash flow. It is expected that the repatriations to be made during 2005 under the Act will provide the Company with greater financial stability and the ability to fund the U.S. cash needs for the intermediate term. As disclosed in prior 10 K and 10 Q filings, the Company had intended to fund future U.S. cash flow deficits by repatriating funds in amounts up to its U.S. NOLs. This strategy would have minimized taxes on such repatriations of funds, but would have also utilized some or all of the U.S. NOLs and the potential benefit of being able to carry forward these U.S. NOLs to reduce U.S. taxable income in the future. Under the Act, qualifying repatriations do not reduce U.S. tax losses. As a result of the Act, the Company will have both the cash necessary to fund its U.S. cash needs as well as maintaining the potential benefit of being able to carry forward U.S. NOLs to reduce U.S. taxable income in the future. This potential future benefit could be significant and is dependent on the Company achieving profitability in the U.S. Under U.S. GAAP companies must review and provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that may not have future benefit. The Company has generally established a valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to changes in tax planning strategies triggered by the opportunity to take full advantage of the Act. At December 31, 2004 the Company has approximately $1 billion of U.S. NOLs for tax purposes available to offset future U.S. taxable income through 2024. The Company has in general recorded a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the U.S. The Company expects additional U.S. NOLs to be generated in 2005. If Congress does not legislate certain technical corrections related to the Act in 2005, the Companys U.S. NOLs could be reduced by approximately $675 million. As stated above the Company intends to repatriate approximately $9.4 billion during 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Companys foreign based subsidiaries held cash and short term investments totaling approximately $5.8 billion. This amount excludes $1.9 billion in cash that the foreign based subsidiaries will receive from a counterparty upon termination of an interest rate swap arrangement that the Company will terminate in 2005. Additionally, the foreign based subsidiaries are expected to generate substantial cash flow during 2005 which will be available to fund the planned repatriation. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow In 2004, operating activities used $154 million of cash. This amount includes the receipt of $404 million for a U.S. tax refund related to the carryback of 2003 U.S. NOLs and the payment of $473 million to the U.S. government for a tax deficiency relating to certain transactions entered into in 1991 and 1992, and the payment of $294 million under the settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 2003, operating activities provided approximately $601 million of cash. This amount includes the cash flow benefit from the reduction in accounts receivable following the end of sales of CLARITIN as a prescription product in the U.S. This amount also includes a $250 million payment relating to the FDA consent decree. In both 2004 and 2003, operating activities on a worldwide basis generated insufficient cash to fund capital expenditures and dividends. This cash flow deficit is particularly pronounced when disaggregated on a geographic basis. Foreign operations generate cash in excess of local cash needs. However, U.S. operations 31 Table of Contents have cash needs well in excess of cash generated in the U.S. The U.S. operations must fund dividend payments, the vast majority of research and development costs and U.S. capital expenditures. In years prior to 2003, overall U.S. cash needs were funded primarily through operations. Following the loss of marketing exclusivity of CLARITIN in December 2002, U.S. profits and cash generation declined materially. Cash requirements during 2004 in the U.S. including operating cash needs, capital expenditures, litigation and tax charges, and dividends on common and preferred shares approximated $2.2 billion. The Company borrowed funds and issued equity securities during 2004 as discussed below to finance U.S. operations, and continued to accumulate cash in its foreign based subsidiaries. In 2005, management expects that dividends and capital expenditures on a worldwide basis will again exceed cash generated from operating activities and that U.S. operations will continue to generate negative cash flow. Payments regarding litigation and investigations could increase cash needs. Management expects to fund the overall 2005 U.S. cash flow deficit by using cash and investments currently held by its foreign subsidiaries. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, discussed above, will provide the Company with greater financial stability and the ability to fund U.S. cash needs for the intermediate term. Total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments less total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company anticipates this amount to decline in 2005, but remain positive. In August 2004 the Company issued 6% mandatory convertible preferred stock (see Note 10 Shareholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and received net proceeds of $1.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. The proceeds were used to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings, to pay settlement amounts and litigation costs, and fund operating expenses, shareholder dividends and capital expenditures. The preferred stock was issued under the Companys $2.0 billion shelf registration. As of December 31, 2004, $563 million remains registered and unissued under the shelf registration. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, the Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and A+ (on Credit Watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poors (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moodys or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A , respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 8 Short Term Borrowings, Long Term Debt and Other Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On July 14, 2004, Moodys lowered its rating on the notes to Baa1. Accordingly, the interest payable on each note increased 25 basis points effective December 1, 2004. Therefore, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3% to 5.55%, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5% to 6.75%. This adjustment to the interest rate payable on the notes will increase the Companys interest expense by approximately $6 million annually. The Company has two revolving credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion. Both facilities are from a syndicate of major financial institutions. The most recently negotiated facility (May 2004) is a $1.25 billion, five year credit facility. This facility matures in May 2009 and requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent. The second credit facility provides a $250 million line of credit through its maturity date in May 2006 and requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent any time the Company is rated at or below Baa3 by Moodys and BBB by S&P. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes and are considered as support for the Companys commercial paper borrowings. These facilities do not require compensating balances; however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. At December 31, 2004, no funds were drawn under either of these facilities. 32 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, short term borrowings totaled $1.6 billion. Approximately 93 percent of this was outstanding commercial paper. The commercial paper ratings discussed below have not significantly affected the Companys ability to issue or rollover its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, the Company believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as the Company, with one or more short term credit ratings of P 2 from Moodys, A 2 from S&P and or F2 from Fitch Ratings (Fitch) to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to such issuers is typically less than that of higher rated companies. The Company maintains sizable lines of credit with commercial banks, as well as cash and short term investments held by foreign based subsidiaries, to serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Credit Ratings On February 18, 2004, S&P downgraded the Companys senior unsecured debt ratings to A from A. At the same time, S&P also lowered the Companys short term corporate credit and commercial paper rating to A 2 from A 1. The Companys S&P rating outlook remains negative. On May 11, 2004, the shelf registration, as amended, that allowed the Company to issue up to $2 billion in various debt and equity securities was declared effective by the SEC. On March 3, 2004, S&P assigned the shelf registration a preliminary rating of A for senior unsecured debt and a preliminary subordinated debt rating of BBB+. As of September 30, 2004, $563 million remains registered and unissued under the shelf registration. On April 29, 2004, Moodys placed the Companys senior unsecured credit rating of A3 on its Watchlist for possible downgrade based upon concerns related to market share declines, litigation risks and a high degree of reliance on the success of VYTORIN. On July 14, 2004, Moodys lowered the Companys senior unsecured credit rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered the Companys senior unsecured shelf registration rating from (P)A3 to (P)Baa1, lowered the Companys subordinated shelf registration rating from (P)Baa1 to (P)Baa2, lowered the Companys cumulative and non cumulative preferred stock shelf registration rating from (P)Baa2 to (P)Baa3, confirmed the Companys P 2 commercial paper rating and removed the Company from the Watchlist. Moodys rating outlook for the Company is negative. See the Borrowings and Credit Facilities section above for a discussion of the impact of Moodys rating downgrade on the interest rates payable on the Companys long term debt. On November 20, 2003, Fitch downgraded the Companys senior unsecured and bank loan ratings to A from A+, and its commercial paper rating to F 2 from F 1. The Companys rating outlook remained negative. In announcing the downgrade, Fitch noted that the sales decline in the Companys leading product franchise, at that time the INTRON franchise, was greater than anticipated, and that it was concerned that total Company growth is reliant on the performance of two key growth drivers, ZETIA and REMICADE, in the near term. On August 4, 2004, Fitch affirmed the Companys A senior unsecured rating and bank loan rating and the F 2 commercial paper rating, and reiterated the negative outlook. The Companys credit rating could decline further. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on the Companys long term debt. As discussed above, the Company believes that the repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 will allow the Company to fund its U.S. cash needs for the intermediate term. Financial Arrangements Containing Credit Rating Downgrade Triggers The Company has an interest rate swap arrangement in effect with a counterparty bank that is subject to credit rating triggers. The arrangement utilizes two long term interest rate swap contracts, one between a foreign based subsidiary of the Company and a bank and the other between a U.S. subsidiary of the Company and the same bank. The two contracts have equal and offsetting terms and are covered by a master netting arrangement. The contract involving the foreign based subsidiary permits the subsidiary to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the bank, and the contract involving the U.S. subsidiary permits the bank to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the U.S. subsidiary. Interest is paid on the prepaid balances by both parties at 33 Table of Contents market rates. Prepayments totaling $1.9 billion have been made under both contracts as of December 31, 2004. The arrangement originally provided that in the event the Company failed to maintain the required minimum credit ratings, the counterparty may terminate the transaction by designating an early termination date not earlier than 36 months following the date of such notice to terminate. Both S&Ps and Moodys current credit ratings are below the specified minimum. As of the date of this 10 K, the counterparty has not given the Company notice to terminate. On December 1, 2004, the Company and the counterparty mutually agreed to amend the swap contracts. The Company and the counterparty have agreed to a phased termination of the arrangement, including repayment of all prepaid amounts based on an agreed schedule. The scheduled terminations and associated repayment of the prepaid amounts will begin no later than March 30, 2005, and will end no later than January 15, 2009. In addition, under the amended agreement, the 36 month grace period that previously applied in the event the counterparty gives notice of termination as a result of the Companys failure to maintain the required minimum credit ratings has been extended to January 15, 2009. In the event that the counterparty gives the Company a termination notice under this provision, all scheduled terminations and associated payments will continue according to the agreed repayment schedule during the time between delivery of the termination notice and January 15, 2009. The provisions in the original arrangement, which also allowed the counterparty to give a 12 month notice to terminate the transaction if, on the 10th anniversary of the transaction (November 17, 2007), the Companys credit ratings were not at least A2 by Moodys and A by S&P, have been eliminated. In their place, the Company has accepted a new credit trigger which provides that the counterparty may terminate the transaction should the Company fail to maintain a long term, U.S. dollar denominated, senior unsecured indebtedness rating of at least BBB by S&P or Baa2 by Moodys. Termination under this provision would be on the later of November 16, 2007, or 60 days from the date the Company receives such notice to terminate. Should the Company fail to meet the minimum credit requirement resulting in an early termination under this provision, all scheduled swap terminations and associated payments will continue through the termination date. The Company may, at its option, accelerate the scheduled terminations and associated payments for a nominal fee. On February 28, 2005, the Companys foreign based subsidiary and U.S. subsidiary each gave notice to the counterparty to terminate the arrangement. Accordingly, all prepaid amounts will be repaid by the respective obligor. The Company will repay its U.S. obligation with funds repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (see above section entitled Impact of the American Jobs Creation Act). 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period under the Companys known contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, are as follows: Payments Due By Period Less More than than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations(1) $ 2,392 $ $ $ $ 2,392 Operating lease obligations 317 80 115 81 41 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 153 146 7 Research contracts(2) 134 129 5 Capital expenditure commitments 154 151 3 Other purchase orders(3) 998 992 6 Other recorded long term liabilities(4) 534 18 20 20 476 Total $ 4,682 $ 1,516 $ 156 $ 101 $ 2,909 (1) Long term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033. See Note 8 Short Term Borrowings, Long Term Debt and Other Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by the Company without penalty. (3) Other open purchase orders consist of both cancelable and noncancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of the Companys pension plans that do not hold qualified assets and estimated payments under the Companys deferred compensation plans. Environmental Matters The Company has responsibilities for environmental cleanup under various state, local and federal laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Environmental expenditures have not had and, based on information currently available, are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company. See Note 16 Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additional Factors Influencing Operations In the U.S., many of the Companys pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. In the U.S. market, the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government funded programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since the Company is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. 35 Table of Contents Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The new Medicare Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D), which will take effect January 1, 2006, will offer voluntary prescription drug coverage, subsidized by Medicare, to over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries through competing private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Many of the Companys leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g., TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON A). Medicare Part B provides payment for physician services which can include prescription drugs administered incident to a physicians services. Beginning in 2005 the Medicare Part B drugs will be reimbursed in a manner that may limit Schering Ploughs ability to offer larger price concessions or make large price increases on these drugs. Other Schering Plough drugs have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g., CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). The Company could experience expanded utilization of VYTORIN and ZETIA and new drugs in the Companys R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for the Company may be the legislations impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. The Companys operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as the Companys products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. The Company launched OTC CLARITIN in the U.S. in December 2002. Also in December 2002, a competing OTC loratadine product was launched in the U.S. and private label competition was introduced. The Company continues to market CLARINEX (desloratadine) 5 mg Tablets for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, which combines the indication of seasonal allergic rhinitis with the indication of perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria, or hives of unknown cause. The ability of the Company to capture and maintain market share for CLARINEX and OTC CLARITIN in the U.S. market will depend on a number of factors, including: additional entrants in the market for allergy treatments; clinical differentiation of CLARINEX from other allergy treatments and the perception of the extent of such differentiation in the marketplace; the pricing differentials among OTC CLARITIN, CLARINEX, other allergy treatments and generic OTC loratadine; the erosion rate of OTC CLARITIN and CLARINEX sales upon the entry of additional generic OTC loratadine products; and whether or not one or both of the other branded second generation antihistamines are switched from prescription to OTC status. CLARINEX is experiencing intense competition in the prescription U.S. allergy market. The prescription allergy market has been shrinking since the OTC switch of CLARITIN in December 2002. Additionally, the Company is implementing new marketing efforts to address market share performance for CLARINEX. The switch of CLARITIN to OTC status and the introduction of competing OTC loratadine have resulted in a rapid, sharp and material decline in CLARITIN sales in the U.S. and the Companys results of operations. U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN products were $25 million or 0.3 percent of the Companys consolidated global sales in 2003 and $1.4 billion or 14 percent in 2002. Sales of CLARINEX in the U.S. and abroad have also been materially adversely affected by the presence of generic OTC loratadine and OTC CLARITIN. In light of the factors described above, management believes that the Companys December 2002 introduction of OTC CLARITIN, as well as the introduction of a competing OTC loratadine product in December 2002 and additional entrants of generic OTC loratadine products in the market, have had a rapid, sharp and material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in 2003 and 2004. 36 Table of Contents PEG INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy for hepatitis C has contributed substantially to sales in 2003 and 2002 and to a lesser extent in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2002, a competing pegylated interferon based combination product, including a brand of ribavirin, received regulatory approval in most major markets, including the U.S. The overall market share of the hepatitis C franchise has declined sharply, reflecting this new market competition. In addition, the overall market value has contracted. Management believes that the ability of PEG INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy to maintain market share will continue to be adversely affected by competition in the hepatitis C marketplace. Generic forms of ribavirin entered the U.S. market in April 2004. In October 2004, another generic ribavirin was approved by the FDA. The generic forms of ribavirin compete with the Companys REBETOL (ribavirin) Capsules in the U.S. Prior to the second half of 2004 the REBETOL patents were material to the Companys business. As a result of the introduction of a competitor for pegylated interferon and the introduction of generic ribavirin, the value of an important Company product franchise has been severely diminished and earnings and cash flow have been materially and negatively impacted. In October 2002, Merck/ Schering Plough Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA approved ZETIA (ezetimibe) 10 mg for use either by itself or together with statins for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. In March 2003, the Company announced that ezetimibe (EZETROL, as marketed in Europe) had successfully completed the European Union (EU) mutual recognition procedure (MRP). With the completion of the MRP process, the 15 EU member states as well as Iceland and Norway can grant national marketing authorization with unified labeling for EZETROL. EZETROL has been launched in many international markets. The Merck/ Schering Plough partnership also developed a once daily tablet combining ezetimibe with simvastatin (Zocor), Mercks cholesterol modifying medicine. This product is marketed as VYTORIN in the U.S. and INEGY in many international markets. Ezetimibe/simvastatin has been approved for marketing in several countries, including Germany in April of 2004 and in Mexico in March of 2004. On July 23, 2004, Merck/ Schering Plough Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA had approved VYTORIN. INEGY completed the MRP in Europe on October 1, 2004. In September 2004, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Bayer intended to enhance the companies pharmaceutical resources. The agreement was entered into by the Company primarily for strategic purposes. Commencing in October 2004, in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the Company began marketing, selling and distributing Bayers primary care products including AVELOX and CIPRO under an exclusive license agreement. The Company will pay Bayer royalties in excess of 50 percent on these products based on sales, which will have an unfavorable impact on the Companys gross margin percentage. Also commencing in October 2004, the Company assumed Bayers responsibilities for U.S. commercialization activities related to the erectile dysfunction medicine LEVITRA under Bayers co promotion agreement with GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The Company reports its share of LEVITRA results as alliance revenue. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Bayer supports the promotion of certain of the Companys oncology products in the U.S. and key European markets for a defined period of time. In Japan, upon regulatory approval Bayer will co market the Companys cholesterol absorption inhibitor ZETIA. This arrangement does not include the rights to any future cholesterol combination product. ZETIA was filed with regulatory authorities in Japan during the fourth quarter of 2003. This agreement with Bayer potentially restricts the Company from marketing products in the U.S. that would compete with any of the products under the strategic alliance. As a result, the Company expects that it may need to sublicense rights to garenoxacin, the quinolone antibacterial agent that the Company licensed from Toyama. The Company is exploring its options with regard to garenoxacin and will continue to fulfill its commitments to Toyama under its arrangement, including taking the product through regulatory approval. 37 Table of Contents Uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect the Companys operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies and is, therefore, subject to potential administrative actions. Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over all the Companys businesses and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, approval, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of the Companys products. From time to time, agencies, including the FDA, may require the Company to address various manufacturing, advertising, labeling or other regulatory issues, such as those noted below relating to the Companys current manufacturing issues. Failure to comply with governmental regulations can result in delays in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, discontinuance of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position and its results of operations. Additional information regarding government regulation that may affect future results is provided in Part I, Item I, Business, in this annual report on Form 10 K. Additional information about cautionary factors that may affect future results is provided under the caption Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition. As included in Note 14 Consent Decree, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 17, 2002, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the FDA for a consent decree to resolve issues involving the Companys compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices at certain manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey approved and entered the consent decree on May 20, 2002. Under terms of the consent decree, the Company agreed to pay a total of $500 million to the U.S. government in two equal installments of $250 million; the first installment was paid in May 2002 and the second installment was paid in May 2003. As previously reported, the Company accrued a $500 million provision for this consent decree in the fourth quarter of 2001. The consent decree requires the Company to complete a number of actions. In the event certain actions agreed upon in the consent decree are not satisfactorily completed on time, the FDA may assess payments for each deadline missed. The consent decree required the Company to develop and submit for the FDAs concurrence comprehensive cGMP Work Plans for the Companys manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico that are covered by the decree. The Company received FDA concurrence with its proposed cGMP Work Plans on May 14, 2003. The cGMP Work Plans contain a number of Significant Steps whose timely and satisfactory completion are subject to payments of $15,000 per business day for each deadline missed. These payments may not exceed $25 million for 2002, and $50 million for each of the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. These payments are subject to an overall cap of $175 million. In connection with its discussions with the FDA regarding the Companys cGMP Work Plans, and pursuant to the terms of the decree, the Company and the FDA entered into a letter agreement dated April 14, 2003. In the letter agreement, the Company and the FDA agreed to extend by six months the time period during which the Company may incur payments as described above with respect to certain of the Significant Steps whose due dates are December 31, 2005. The letter agreement does not increase the yearly or overall caps on payments described above. In addition, the decree requires the Company to complete programs of revalidation of the finished drug products and bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured at the covered manufacturing facilities. The Company is required under the consent decree to complete its revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients by September 30, 2005, and for finished drugs by December 31, 2005. In general, the timely and satisfactory completions of the revalidations are subject to payments of $15,000 per business day for each deadline missed, subject to the caps described above. However, if a product scheduled for revalidation has not been certified as having been validated by the last date on the validation schedule, the FDA may assess a payment of 24.6 percent of the net domestic sales of the uncertified product until the 38 Table of Contents validation is certified. Any such payment would not be subject to the caps described above. Further, in general, if a product scheduled for revalidation under the consent decree is not certified within six months of its scheduled date, the Company must cease production of that product until certification is obtained. The completion of the Significant Steps in the Work Plans and the completion of the revalidation programs are subject to third party expert certification, as well as the FDAs acceptance of such certification. The consent decree provides that if the Company believes that it may not be able to meet a deadline, the Company has the right, upon the showing of good cause, to request extensions of deadlines in connection with the cGMP Work Plans and revalidation programs. However, there is no guarantee that FDA will grant any such requests. Although the Company believes it has made significant progress in meeting its obligations under the consent decree, it is possible that (1) the Company may fail to complete a Significant Step or a revalidation by the prescribed deadline; (2) the third party expert may not certify the completion of the Significant Step or revalidation; or (3) the FDA may disagree with an experts certification of a Significant Step or revalidation. In such a case, it is possible that the FDA may assess payments as described above. The Company would expense any payments assessed under the decree if and when incurred. In addition, the failure to meet the terms of the consent decree could result in delays in approval of new products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. In April 2003, the Company received notice of a False Claims Act complaint brought by an individual purporting to act on behalf of the U.S. government against it and approximately 25 other pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that the pharmaceutical companies, including the Company, have defrauded the U.S. by having made sales to various federal governmental agencies of drugs that were allegedly manufactured in a manner that did not comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices. The Company and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in this action on April 12, 2004. The Company is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the European Union (EU) and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the manufacturer of the drug and the governmental agency to potential problems. During 2003 pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), serious deficiencies in reporting processes were identified. The Company is taking urgent actions to rectify these deficiencies as quickly as possible. The Company does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to these findings. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against the Company and or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for the Companys products. The Company sells numerous upper respiratory products which contain pseudoephedrine (PSE), an FDA approved ingredient for the relief of nasal congestion. The Companys annual sales of upper respiratory products that contain PSE totaled approximately $195 million in 2004 and approximately $160 million in 2003. These products include all CLARITIN D products as well as some DRIXORAL, CORICIDIN and CHLOR TRIMETON products. The Company understands that PSE has been used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine, a dangerous and addictive drug. As of February 2005, 12 states and Canada have enacted regulations concerning the sale of PSE, including limiting the amount of these products that can be purchased at one time, or requiring that these products be located behind the pharmacists counter, with the stated goal of deterring the illicit/illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. An additional eight states have enacted limits on the quantity of PSE any person can possess. To date, the regulations have not had a material impact on the Companys operations or financial results. 39 Table of Contents As described more specifically in Note 16 Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of the Company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, and the Company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on the Company, its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 151 Inventory Costs. This SFAS requires that abnormal spoilage be expensed in the period incurred (as opposed to inventoried and amortized to income over inventory usage) and that fixed production facility overhead costs be allocated over the normal production level of a facility. This SFAS is effective for inventory costs incurred for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not anticipate any material impact from the implementation of this accounting standard. In December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123R (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment. Statement 123R requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of all share based payments granted to employees. Companies are required to implement this SFAS in July 2005 by recognizing compensation on all share based grants made after July 1, 2005, and for the unvested portion of share based grants made prior to July 1, 2005. Restatement of previously issued statements is allowed, but not required. The Company is currently evaluating the various implementation options available and related financial impacts under SFAS 123R. Critical Accounting Policies The following accounting policies are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the Companys financial statements: Revenue Recognition Rebates, Discounts and Returns Provision for Income Taxes Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition The Companys pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers (e.g., wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations). Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies as well as to indirect purchasers and other market participants (e.g., managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers). 40 Table of Contents The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain Federal and state governmental programs and; iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. When recognizing revenue, the Company estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re evaluated as part of this process. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, the Company defers the recognition of revenue. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, the Company would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell through and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of accruals. During 2004, the Company entered into agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers. These agreements deal with a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of this monitoring and the above noted agreements, the Company expects to avoid situations where the Companys shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Rebate accruals for federal and state governmental programs were $155 million at December 31, 2004, and $127 million at December 31, 2003. Commercial discounts and other rebate accruals were $123 million at December 31, 2004, and $211 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. These and other rebate accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of a liability, which is included in other accrued liabilities. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, the Companys payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy the Companys obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 16 Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. 41 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 487 Provision for Rebates 417 Payments (476 ) (59 ) Provision for Returns 17 Returns (39 ) (22 ) Provision for Discounts 282 Discounts granted (256 ) 26 Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, End of Period $ 432 Management makes estimates and uses assumptions in recording the above accruals. Actual amounts paid in the current period were consistent with those previously estimated. Provision for Income Taxes As of December 31, 2004, taxes have not been provided on approximately $2.2 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, after considering the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. If certain assets associated with these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., additional tax provisions may be necessary. Tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations, including (1) intercompany terms of cross border agreements between affiliates, for which management believes its intercompany terms are based on sound economic facts and circumstances and (2) utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property). The Companys estimate of the accrual for tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amounts accrued. The Company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination would be made. Likewise, should the Company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $580 million at December 31, 2004. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $50 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2004. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and 42 Table of Contents marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. The Companys manufacturing sites operate well below optimum levels due to sales declines and the reduction in output related to the FDA consent decree. At the same time, overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have increased due to the consent decree and other compliance activities. The impact of this is a material increase in manufacturing costs. The Company continues to review the carrying value of these assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and or related costs. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are also required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters. In particular, the Company has recognized estimated minimum liabilities in connection with certain of the government investigations into its sales and marketing activities. The ultimate resolution of this matter could involve amounts materially in excess of amounts accrued. This could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition, cash flows or operations. See Note 16 Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Market Risk Disclosure The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company has subsidiaries in more than 50 countries. In 2004, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 61 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, the Companys reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of foreign operations using derivative financial instruments. Because the Companys foreign subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that the Companys foreign operations are widespread. In addition, at any point in time, the Companys foreign subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term, third party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, the Company has used derivatives to hedge specific short term risk situations involving foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk The only financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and or equity prices are the debt and equity securities held in non qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled $153 million at December 31, 2004. Due to the long term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, the Companys exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest expense are long term and short term borrowings. The Company maintains a cash and cash equivalent portfolio in excess of the amount of borrowings. 43 Table of Contents Accordingly, the Company has mitigated its exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. The Company has long term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of the debt by $127 million. However, the Company does not expect to refund this debt. Disclosure Notice Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. They use words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, forecast, project, intend, plan, potential, will, and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events, circumstances or future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, forward looking statements include statements relating to future actions, ability to access the capital markets, prospective products, the status of product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, development programs, estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, expenses and programs to reduce expenses, the cost of and savings from reductions in work force, the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations, growth strategy and financial results. Any or all forward looking statements here or in other publications may turn out to be wrong. Actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about Schering Ploughs financial and operational performance or the performance of Schering Plough stock. Schering Plough does not assume the obligation to update any forward looking statement. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from Schering Ploughs forward looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following: A significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. Competitive factors, including technological advances attained by competitors, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors coming to the market, new indications for competitive products, and new and existing generic, prescription and or OTC products that compete with products of Schering Plough or the Merck/ Schering Plough Pharmaceuticals joint venture (such as competition from OTC statins, like the one approved for use in the U.K., the impact of which in the cholesterol reduction market is not yet known). Increased pricing pressure both in the U.S. and abroad from managed care organizations, institutions and government agencies and programs. In the U.S., among other developments, consolidation among customers may increase pricing pressures and may result in various customers having greater influence over prescription decisions through formulary decisions and other policies. The potential impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003; possible other U.S. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, including Medicaid and Medicare; involuntary approval of prescription medicines for over the counter use; and other health care reform initiatives and drug importation 44 Table of Contents legislation. Legislation or regulations in markets outside the U.S. affecting product pricing, reimbursement or access. Laws and regulations relating to trade, antitrust, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls and possible nationalization. Patent positions can be highly uncertain and patent disputes are not unusual. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively impact sales of existing products or result in injunctive relief and payment of financial remedies. Uncertainties of the FDA approval process and the regulatory approval and review processes in other countries, including, without limitation, delays in approval of new products. Failure to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices established by the FDA and other governmental authorities can result in delays in the approval of products, release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. The resolution of manufacturing issues with the FDA discussed in Schering Ploughs 10 Ks, 10 Qs and 8 Ks are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, including the timing, scope and duration of a resolution of the manufacturing issues, will depend on the ability of Schering Plough to assure the FDA of the quality and reliability of its manufacturing systems and controls, and the extent of remedial and prospective obligations undertaken by Schering Plough. Difficulties in product development. Pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach market for numerous reasons. They may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in clinical or pre clinical testing, they may fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, they may turn out not to be economically feasible because of manufacturing costs or other factors or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others. Post marketing issues. Once a product is approved and marketed, clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance may raise efficacy or safety concerns. Whether or not scientifically justified, this new information could lead to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products, which may negatively impact sales. Concerns of prescribers or patients relating to the safety or efficacy of Schering Plough products, or other companies products or pharmaceutical products generally, may also negatively impact sales. Major products such as CLARITIN, CLARINEX, INTRON A, PEG INTRON, REBETOL Capsules, REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX accounted for a material portion of Schering Ploughs 2004 revenues. If any major product were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, OTC availability of the Companys product or a competitive product (as has been disclosed for CLARITIN and its current and potential OTC competition), previously unknown side effects; if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced; generic availability of competitive products; or if the product is discontinued for any reason, the impact on revenues could be significant. Also, such information about important new products, such as ZETIA and VYTORIN, or important products in our pipeline, may impact future revenues. Further, sales of VYTORIN may negatively impact sales of ZETIA. Unfavorable outcomes of government (local and federal, domestic and international) investigations, litigation about product pricing, product liability claims, other litigation and environmental concerns could preclude commercialization of products, negatively affect the profitability of existing products, materially and adversely impact Schering Ploughs financial condition and results of operations, or contain conditions that impact business operations, such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Economic factors over which Schering Plough has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 45 Table of Contents Instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region due to the location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or customers regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. Changes in tax laws including changes related to taxation of foreign earnings. Changes in accounting and auditing standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that would require a significant change to Schering Ploughs accounting practices. For further details and a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, see Schering Ploughs past and future SEC reports and filings. Item 7A.
