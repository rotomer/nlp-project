Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of the Company Schering Plough (the Company) discovers, develops, manufactures and markets medical therapies and treatments to enhance human health. The Company also markets leading consumer brands in the over the counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and operates a global animal health business. 23 Table of Contents As a research based pharmaceutical company, a core strategy of Schering Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments with important medical and commercial value. Consistent with this core strategy, the Company has been increasing its investment in research and development, and this trend is expected to continue at historic levels or greater. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. There is a high rate of failure inherent in such research and, as a result, there is a high risk that the funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to the commercial phase may take a decade or more. There are two sources of new products: products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements, and products in the Companys late stage research pipeline. With respect to acquisitions and licensing, there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late stage products, and these limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding. The Company competes for these opportunities against companies often with greater financial resources. Accordingly, it may be challenging for the Company to acquire or license critical late stage products that will have a positive material financial impact. The Company supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. The Company is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets, information technology systems, and post marketing studies and monitoring. The Companys financial situation continues to improve, as discussed below. The Companys cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are the primary drivers of this improvement. ZETIA is the Companys novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor, Merck & Co., Inc.s (Merck) statin medication. These two products have been launched through a joint venture between the Company and Merck. ZETIA (ezetimibe), marketed in Europe as EZETROL, is marketed for use either by itself or together with statins for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. ZETIA/ EZETROL has been launched in more than 60 countries. VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), marketed as INEGY internationally, has been launched in over 20 countries, including the United States. The Company currently expects its cholesterol franchise to continue to grow. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. Outside of the joint venture with Merck, in the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare will co market the Companys cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, upon approval. Due to a backlog of new drug applications in Japan, the Company cannot precisely predict the timing of this approval. The cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market, and on a combined basis, these products continued to grow in terms of market share during 2005. As a franchise, the two products together have captured more than 14 percent of new prescriptions for the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2006 IMS data). VYTORIN currently ranks as the third leading prescription product for treating patients with high cholesterol (based on new prescriptions). To date, physicians have written more than 11 million total prescriptions for VYTORIN in the U.S. ZETIA sales continue to grow even as VYTORIN grows its market share. During 2005, the Companys results of operations and cash flows were driven significantly by the performance of VYTORIN and ZETIA. As a result, the Companys ability to generate profits is predominantly dependent upon the performance of the VYTORIN and ZETIA cholesterol franchise, which dependence is expected to continue for some time. For 2005, equity income from the cholesterol joint venture was $873 million and net income available to common shareholders was $183 million. Additional information regarding the joint venture with Merck is also included in Note 3, Equity Income 24 Table of Contents from Cholesterol Joint Venture, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K. Although it is expected that operating cash flow, existing cash and investments, including funds repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), will fund the Companys operations for the near and intermediate term, as discussed in more detail below, future cash flows are also dependent upon the performance of VYTORIN and ZETIA. The Company must generate profits and cash flows to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business as discussed above. Sales of the products may be impacted by the introduction of new innovative competing treatments and generic versions of existing products. In this regard, the Company expects that generic forms of Pravachol and Zocor, two existing well established cholesterol management products, will be introduced in the U.S. as they lose patent protection beginning in 2006 (generics have been introduced during 2005 in some international markets). The Company cannot reasonably predict what effect the introduction of generic forms of cholesterol management products may have on VYTORIN and ZETIA, although the decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and reimbursement policies could potentially negatively impact the dollar size and or growth of the cholesterol management market, including VYTORIN and ZETIA. A material change in the sales or market share of VYTORIN and ZETIA would have a significant impact on the Companys operations and cash flow. REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease and ankylosing spondylitis, and recently gained approval in Europe for psoriasis. REMICADE is the Companys second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). This product is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. The Company has the exclusive marketing rights to this product outside of the U.S., Japan, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan and Indonesia. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, in the same territories as REMICADE. Golimumab is currently under Phase III trials. Centocor believes these rights to golimumab expire in 2014, while the Company believes these rights extend beyond 2014. The parties are working together to move forward with their collaboration on golimumab, and steps are being taken to resolve the difference of opinion as to the expiration date. As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, the Company licenses manufacturing, marketing and or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of the Company that may create positive or negative impacts on the Company. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to the Companys current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(q) to the Companys 10 K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(u) to the Companys 10 K. During the period from 2002 to 2004, the Company experienced a number of negative events that have strained and continue to strain the Companys financial resources. While as explained below, the Companys overall financial situation began to improve in 2005, these negative events remain relevant to understand the Companys current challenges. These negative events included, but were not limited to, the following matters: Entered into a formal Consent Decree with the FDA in 2002 and agreed to implement a cGMP Work Plan and revalidate manufacturing processes at certain manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The Company has completed all of the significant steps of the cGMP Work Plan and validation actions required by December 31, 2005, under the Consent Decree. These are subject to certification by an external third party and review and approval by the FDA. Under the terms of 25 Table of Contents the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified the Company of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in the five year period since the Decrees entry, May 2002 through May 2007, the Company may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and the FDA will not oppose the Companys petition. The Company has incurred significant costs associated with manufacturing compliance efforts as part of the Consent Decree. Incremental compliance costs will be incurred through the completion of the third party certification and FDA review and approval process. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain older profitable products and outsource other products. Switch of CLARITIN in the U.S., beginning in December 2002, from prescription to OTC status. This switch coupled with private label competition has resulted in substantially lower overall sales of this product starting in 2003 as well as lower average unit selling price for this product and ongoing intense competition. The Companys exposure to powerful retail purchasers has also increased. Market shares and sales levels of certain other Company products fell significantly and have experienced increased competition. Some of these products continue to compete in declining or volatile markets. Investigations into certain of the Companys sales and marketing practices by the U.S. Attorneys Offices in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. During 2004, the Company made payments totaling $294 million to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in settlement of that investigation. In response to these matters, beginning in April 2003, the Board of Directors named Fred Hassan as the new Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering Plough Corporation. Under his leadership, a new leadership team was recruited and a six to eight year, five phase Action Agenda was formulated with the goal of stabilizing, repairing and turning around the Company. In October 2005, the Company announced that it has entered the third, Turnaround, phase of the Action Agenda. The beginning of the Turnaround phase had been defined as achieving three consecutive quarters of sales and earnings growth, excluding special items. Current State of the Business Net sales in 2005 were $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 15 percent, over the 2004 period. The increase was driven primarily by the growth of REMICADE, PEG INTRON, NASONEX, TEMODAR and the Animal Health business, and the U.S. sales contribution from the antibiotics AVELOX and CIPRO and other products under the agreement with Bayer that became effective in October 2004. Foreign exchange contributed 1 percent to the sales increase. Sales and marketing costs have increased due to the addition of Bayer sales representatives, increased selling expenses in Europe to support the continued launches of VYTORIN and ZETIA, and increased promotional spending, primarily for NASONEX, ASMANEX and the products under the agreement with Bayer. The Company had net income available to common shareholders of $183 million for 2005, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $981 million in 2004. Net income available to common shareholders for 2005 included a charge to increase the litigation reserves by $250 million resulting in a total reserve of $500 million representing the Companys current estimate to resolve the Massachusetts investigation as well as the investigations disclosed under AWP Investigations and the state litigation disclosed under AWP Litigation in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition, net income available to common shareholders also included research and development expense of approximately $124 million (or $118 million net of tax) for the license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab. Net loss available to common shareholders for 2004 included a pre tax research and development charge of $80 million for the license of garenoxacin from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd., tax expense of $779 million which included a 26 Table of Contents provision for taxes related to the planned repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act, and a valuation reserve for net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Many of the Companys manufacturing sites operate below capacity. The Companys manufacturing sites subject to the Consent Decree remained open while the Company was performing its revalidation and cGMP Work Plan obligations under decree. However, the Consent Decree work placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites, which increased costs and slowed production and led to a reduction in the product mix at the sites. Further, the Companys research and development operations were negatively impacted by the Consent Decree because these operations share common facilities with the manufacturing operations. Although certain costs, such as those associated with third party certifications, will decrease when the completion of the Work Plan is certified, other financial impacts will continue, such as the costs of the new processes that will continue to be used and the reduced product mix and volumes at the sites. The Companys manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce the Companys manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. In most cases, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction, revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and or related costs. During 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $9.4 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate as provided by the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). Repatriating funds under the AJCA benefits the Company in the following ways: The Companys U.S. operations currently incur significant negative cash flow. Operating cash flows, existing cash and investments, including repatriations made during 2005 under the AJCA, are expected to provide the Company with the ability to fund U.S. cash needs for the near and intermediate term. The Company will continue to use repatriated funds for AJCA qualified spending. The U.S. operations during 2005 and 2004 produced U.S. tax net operating loss (U.S. NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1.5 billion. Under the AJCA, qualifying repatriations do not reduce U.S. tax losses. As such, the Company has both the cash necessary to fund its U.S. cash needs and the potential benefit of being able to carry forward U.S. NOLs to reduce future U.S. taxable income. This potential future benefit could be significant but is dependent on the Company achieving profitability in the U.S. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. Consolidated net sales in 2005 totaled $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 15 percent compared with 2004. Consolidated net sales reflected higher volumes of REMICADE, PEG INTRON, NASONEX, TEMODAR and the inclusion of a full year of sales of AVELOX and CIPRO. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 1 percent. Consolidated 2004 net sales of $8.3 billion had decreased $62 million or 1 percent as compared to 2003, primarily reflecting volume declines offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 4 percent. 27 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 (Dollars in millions) PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 7,564 $ 6,417 $ 6,611 18 % (3 )% REMICADE 942 746 540 26 38 PEG INTRON 751 563 802 33 (30 ) NASONEX 737 594 500 24 19 CLARINEX/ AERIUS 646 692 694 (7 ) 0 TEMODAR 588 459 324 28 42 CLARITIN Rx(a) 371 321 328 16 (2 ) REBETOL 331 287 639 15 (55 ) INTEGRILIN 315 325 306 (3 ) 6 INTRON A 287 318 409 (10 ) (22 ) AVELOX 228 44 N/M N/M SUBUTEX 197 185 144 6 29 CAELYX 181 150 111 21 35 CIPRO 146 43 N/M N/M ELOCON 144 168 154 (14 ) 9 Other Pharmaceutical 1,700 1,522 1,660 12 (8 ) CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,093 1,085 1,026 1 6 OTC(b) 556 578 588 (4 ) (2 ) Foot Care 333 331 292 1 13 Sun Care 204 176 146 16 20 ANIMAL HEALTH 851 770 697 11 10 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 9,508 $ 8,272 $ 8,334 15 % (1 )% Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. N/ M Not a meaningful percentage. (a) Amounts shown include international sales of CLARITIN Rx only. (b) Includes OTC CLARITIN of $394, $419, and $432 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. International net sales of REMICADE, for the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis, were up $196 million or 26 percent in 2005 to $942 million due to greater demand, expanded indications and continued market growth. Sales of REMICADE in 2004 were $746 million, up $206 million or 38 percent compared with 2003, due to greater medical use and expanded indications in European markets. In the near future, additional competitive products for the indications referred to above are likely to be introduced. Global net sales of PEG INTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, increased $188 million or 33 percent to $751 million compared with 2004 due to the December 2004 launch of the PEG INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan. Sales in Japan benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG INTRON before beginning treatment (patient warehousing). Comparisons in 2006 will be unfavorably impacted by the absence of this patient warehousing and anticipated government mandated price reductions in Japan. As a result of these factors, sales may decline materially. Sales of PEG INTRON in the U.S. in 2005 have decreased, primarily reflecting a decline in the overall market. Sales of PEG INTRON decreased 28 Table of Contents $239 million or 30 percent to $563 million in 2004, due primarily to loss of market share reflecting the entrance of a competitors new products in the hepatitis C market in 2003. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 24 percent to $737 million in 2005 as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share versus the 2004 period. U.S. sales benefited from an increased promotional effort and the introduction, beginning in January 2005, of a new scent free, alcohol free formulation of NASONEX nasal spray. 2004 sales of NASONEX increased 19 percent versus 2003 to $594 million primarily due to international sales growth and favorable prior year trade inventory comparisons in the U.S., tempered by a decline in U.S. market share. Generic Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year round indoor allergies, decreased $46 million, or 7 percent, versus 2004. Sales in the U.S. decreased $95 million or 23 percent versus 2004 due to reduced market share in a declining market. In September 2005, generic Allegra (fexofenadine) was introduced to the U.S., which will continue to negatively affect the antihistamine market including CLARINEX. Sales outside the U.S. increased $49 million or 18 percent to $321 million in 2005 due primarily to market share gains. Global net sales of CLARINEX were $692 million in 2004, essentially flat versus 2003. Sales outside the U.S. increased 39 percent to $272 million in 2004 due to market share gains and continued conversion from prescription CLARITIN. U.S. sales decreased 16 percent to $420 million in 2004 due to the continued contraction in the U.S. prescription antihistamine market following the launch of OTC CLARITIN and other branded and non branded non sedating antihistamines coupled with market share declines. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased $129 million or 28 percent to $588 million in 2005 due to increased utilization for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most prevalent form of brain cancer. This new indication was granted U.S. FDA approval in March 2005 and was rapidly adopted by U.S. physicians. In June 2005, TEMODAR received approval from the European Commission for use in combination with radiotherapy for GBM patients in 25 member states as well as in Iceland and Norway. In Japan, TEMODAR was granted a priority review of the regulatory application to treat malignant glioma in the 2005 fourth quarter. Sales of TEMODAR increased $135 million or 42 percent to $459 million in 2004 due to increased market penetration. The growth rates for TEMODAR may moderate going forward, as significant market penetration has already been achieved in the treatment of GBM, especially in the U.S. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN increased $50 million or 16 percent to $371 million in 2005 due to the launch of CLARITIN REDITABS in Japan coupled with an unusually severe Japanese allergy season that may not recur in 2006. In 2004, international sales of prescription CLARITIN were $321 million, a decrease of 2 percent compared to 2003 due to continued conversion to CLARINEX. Global net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with INTRON A or PEG INTRON for treating hepatitis C, increased $44 million or 15 percent to $331 million in 2005 due primarily to the launch of the PEG INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan in December 2004. Sales in Japan benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG INTRON before beginning treatment (patient warehousing). Comparisons in 2006 will be unfavorably impacted by the absence of this patient warehousing and, as a result, sales may decline materially. REBETOL may also be subject to larger than average government mandated price reductions in Japan. Sales of REBETOL in 2004 decreased 55 percent to $287 million due to the launch of generic versions of REBETOL in the U.S. in April 2004 and increased price competition outside the U.S. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold primarily in the U.S. by the Company, were $315 million in 2005 compared with $325 million in 2004. While sales of INTEGRILIN in the U.S. were essentially flat versus 2004, sales outside the U.S. decreased $8 million, reflecting the return of 29 Table of Contents European marketing rights to Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Millennium). Sales of INTEGRILIN in 2004 increased $19 million or 6 percent versus 2003 due to increased patient utilization. Effective September 1, 2005, the Company restructured its INTEGRILIN co promotion agreement with Millennium. Under the terms of the restructured agreement, the Company acquired exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in exchange for an upfront payment of $36 million and royalties on INTEGRILIN sales. The restructured agreement calls for minimum royalty payments of $85 million per year to Millennium for 2006 and 2007. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 10 percent in 2005 to $287 million due to the conversion to PEG INTRON in Japan. Sales of INTRON A decreased 22 percent in 2004 to $318 million due primarily to lower demand. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough as a result of the Companys license agreement with Bayer, were $228 million in 2005. Sales of AVELOX in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer, which was effective October 1, 2004. International net sales of SUBUTEX Tablets, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 6 percent to $197 million in 2005 due to increased market penetration. Sales of SUBUTEX were $185 million in 2004, an increase of 29 percent over 2003 due to increased market penetration. It is expected that SUBUTEX will encounter generic competition in the near future. International sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposis sarcoma, increased 21 percent to $181 million, reflecting further adoption of the ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer indications. Sales of CAELYX in 2004 increased 35 percent versus 2003 to $150 million, reflecting initial adoption of the metastatic breast cancer indication. Net sales of CIPRO, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory, skin, urinary tract and other infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough as a result of the Companys license agreement with Bayer, were $146 million in 2005. Sales of CIPRO in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer. Global net sales of ELOCON cream, a medium potency topical steroid, decreased 14 percent to $144 million, reflecting generic competition introduced in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2005. Generic competition is expected to continue to adversely affect sales of this product. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. The products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, were $1.1 billion in 2005 and 2004. Sales of OTC CLARITIN were $394 million in 2005, a decrease of $25 million or 6 percent from 2004, reflecting the adverse impact on sales of CLARITIN D due to restrictions on the retail sale of OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (PSE) that came into effect during 2005. Sales of CLARITIN D may continue to be adversely affected by both recent and future restrictions on the retail sale of such products. In addition, OTC CLARITIN continues to face competition from private label and branded loratadine. Net sales of sun care products increased $28 million or 16 percent in 2005, primarily due to the launch of new COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products coupled with a stronger overall suncare season in the U.S. Net sales of foot care products increased $2 million or 1 percent in 2005, due primarily to the new MEMORY FIT and FOR HER INSOLES and other insole products. Net sales of Consumer Health Care products in 2004 increased $59 million or 6 percent compared to 2003, due primarily to the strong performance of DR. SCHOLLS FREEZE AWAY and other foot care products. 30 Table of Contents The Company sells numerous non prescription upper respiratory products that contain PSE, an FDA approved ingredient for the relief of nasal congestion. The Companys annual North American sales of non prescription upper respiratory products that contain PSE totaled approximately $277 million in 2005, $305 million in 2004 and approximately $160 million in 2003. These products include all CLARITIN D products as well as some DRIXORAL, CORICIDIN and CHLOR TRIMETON products. The Company understands that PSE has been used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine, a dangerous and addictive drug. As of December 31, 2005, 26 states, Canada and Mexico have enacted regulations concerning the non prescription sale of products containing PSE, including limiting the amount of these products that can be purchased at one time or requiring that these products be located behind the pharmacists counter, with the stated goal of deterring the illicit/illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. An additional 12 states have enacted limits on the quantity of PSE any person can possess. One state has recently enacted legislation that regulates all PSE products to prescription status. Also, the U.S. federal government has proposed legislation placing restrictions on the sale of products containing PSE. Further, major U.S. retailers that are customers of the Company have voluntarily placed non prescription products containing PSE behind the pharmacy counter at all of their stores, whether or not required by local law. Sales of non prescription PSE products were down $28 million or approximately 9 percent as compared to 2004. The Company continues to monitor developments in this area that could have a further negative impact on operations or financial results. It should be noted that these regulations do not relate to the sale of prescription products, such as CLARINEX D products, that contain PSE. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 11 percent in 2005 to $851 million. The increased sales reflected strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas, led by products serving the U.S. cattle market, including NUFLOR, and the vaccine business. The increased sales were also due in part to better product supply in the U.S. The sales growth included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1 percent. The Company expects this growth rate to moderate due to increased competition, including generic products. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 10 percent in 2004, which included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 6 percent. Certain situations that had a positive impact on sales and net income in 2005 may not recur in 2006. These include the favorable effect of foreign exchange, the patient warehousing benefit to PEG INTRON and REBETOL related to the launch of PEG INTRON in Japan, and an unusually severe allergy season in Japan that benefited the reported sales of prescription CLARITIN. Generic Allegra (fexofenadine) was introduced in the U.S. during 2005, which is expected to have a negative impact on U.S. CLARINEX sales in 2006. Generic Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market. The growth of REMICADE may also be affected by increased competition. In addition, the Company expects the growth rate for the Animal Health business to moderate due to increased competition, including generic products. 31 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 (Dollars in millions) Cost of sales $ 3,346 $ 3,070 $ 2,833 9 % 8 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 4,374 3,811 3,474 15 % 10 % Research and development (R&D) 1,865 1,607 1,469 16 % 9 % Other expense/(income), net 5 146 59 N/M N/M Special charges 294 153 599 N/M N/M Equity income from cholesterol joint venture (873 ) (347 ) (54 ) N/M N/M N/ M Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in the Companys net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income from cholesterol joint venture. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, the Company incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in the Companys Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, the Companys gross margin, and ratios of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the impact of the joint ventures operating results. Gross margin Gross margin increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 from 62.9 percent to 64.8 percent, primarily due to supply chain process improvements, increased sales of higher margin products and a favorable impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by higher royalties related to the Bayer products and beginning September 1, 2005, royalties for INTEGRILIN. The restructuring of the INTEGRILIN agreement has substantially offsetting effects, generally increasing cost of sales due to increased royalties offset by reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. Gross margin in 2006 will be unfavorably impacted by a full year of the increased royalties from this restructured agreement. Gross margin in 2004 decreased as compared to 2003 from 66.0 percent to 62.9 percent, primarily due to lower production volumes coupled with increased spending related to the FDA Consent Decree, other manufacturing compliance spending and efforts to upgrade the Companys global infrastructure. The absence of European LOSEC revenues and a change in product sales mix, including sales of Bayer licensed products, contributed to the unfavorable comparison as well. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 15 percent to $4.4 billion in 2005 versus $3.8 billion in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the addition in the 2004 fourth quarter of Bayer sales representatives, increased selling expenses in Europe to support the continued launch of VYTORIN and ZETIA, and increased promotional spending, primarily for NASONEX, ASMANEX and the products under the agreement with Bayer. SG&A expenses increased 10 percent to $3.8 billion in 2004 from $3.5 billion in 2003 primarily due to the expansion of the sales field force, higher employee related costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower promotional spending. Research and development Research and development (R&D) spending increased 16 percent to $1.9 billion, representing 19.6 percent of net sales in 2005, and included a $124 million charge in conjunction with the Companys exercise of its rights to develop and commercialize golimumab. R&D spending for 2004 included an $80 million charge in conjunction with the license from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd. for garenoxacin. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of the Companys funding of both internal research 32 Table of Contents efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. The Company believes it has a strong Early Development pipeline across a wide range of therapeutic areas with 14 preclinical/ Phase I compounds in 2005. Additionally, as the later phase growth drivers of the pipeline enter Phase III (e.g., Thrombin Receptor Antagonist, vicriviroc and HCV protease inhibitor), the Company anticipates an approximate doubling of annual patient enrollment in clinical trials over the next 2 4 years versus 2005 levels. The Company expects R&D spending to increase as compared to prior years due to the progression of the Companys early stage pipeline and increased clinical trial activity. To maximize the Companys chances for the successful development of new products, the Company began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high priority programs within R&D. Other expense/(income), net In 2005, Other expense/(income), net, of $5 million was lower than 2004 as it reflected higher net interest income due to higher interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments. The increase in Other expense/(income), net, in 2004 versus 2003 was primarily the result of higher net interest expense due to debt issuances in 2003. Special charges The components of special charges are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Litigation charges $ 250 $ $ 350 Employee termination costs 28 119 179 Asset impairment and other charges 16 34 70 $ 294 $ 153 $ 599 Litigation charges In 2005, litigation reserves were increased by $250 million. This increase resulted in a total reserve of $500 million for the Massachusetts investigation as well as the investigations disclosed under AWP Investigations and the state litigation disclosed under AWP Litigation in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, representing the Companys current estimate to resolve this matter. Additional information regarding litigation reserves is also included in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K. In 2003, litigation reserves were increased by $350 million, primarily as a result of the investigations into the Companys sales and marketing practices. Employee termination costs In August 2003, the Company announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. Under this program, eligible employees in the U.S. had until December 15, 2003 to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, all of which have retired by December 31, 2005. The total cost of this program was approximately $191 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $108 million, increased post retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of 33 Table of Contents $22 million. Amounts recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003 for this program were $7 million, $20 million and $164 million, respectively. No additional amounts are expected to be recognized under this program. Termination costs not associated with the VERP totaled $21 million, $99 million and $15 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs: Employee Termination Costs (Dollars in millions) Special charges incurred during 2003 $ 179 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (144 ) Disbursements (6 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2003 $ 29 Special charges incurred during 2004 $ 119 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (20 ) Disbursements (110 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2004 $ 18 Special charges incurred during 2005 $ 28 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (7 ) Disbursements (35 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2005 $ 4 Asset impairment and other charges For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized asset impairment and other charges of $16 million related primarily to the consolidation of the Companys U.S. biotechnology organizations. The Company recorded asset impairment and other charges of $34 million in 2004, related primarily to the shutdown of a small European research and development facility. Asset impairment and other charges in 2003 were $70 million and related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, the write down of production equipment related to products that were no longer going to be produced at a manufacturing site operating under the FDA Consent Decree, and the write down of a drug license and a sun care trade name for which expected cash flows did not support the carrying value. Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture Global cholesterol franchise sales, which include sales made by the Company and the cholesterol joint venture with Merck of VYTORIN and ZETIA, totaled $2.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $471 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 sales comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. As a franchise, the two products combined have passed the 14 percent share level of new prescriptions in the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2006 IMS data). VYTORIN has been launched in more than 20 countries, including the U.S. in August 2004. ZETIA has been approved in more than 70 countries and has been launched in more than 60 countries. The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting for the joint venture. Sharing of income from operations is based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. The Companys allocation of joint venture income is increased by milestones earned. Merck and Schering Plough (the Partners) bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the joint venture reimburses each Partner for a pre defined amount of physician details that are set on an annual basis. The Company 34 Table of Contents reports this reimbursement as part of equity income from the cholesterol joint venture. This reimbursement does not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs for the Companys detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, this reimbursement amount is not reflective of Schering Ploughs sales effort related to the joint venture as Schering Ploughs sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the Partners contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct to consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out of pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the Partners. Equity income from cholesterol joint venture totaled $873 million, $347 million and $54 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 equity income comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized milestones from Merck of $20 million, $7 million and $20 million, respectively. The $20 million milestone in 2005 related to certain European approvals of VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in 2005. The $7 million milestone in 2004 related to the approval of ezetimibe/simvastatin in Mexico in 2004. The $20 million milestone in 2003 related to certain European approvals of ZETIA in 2003. These amounts are included in equity income. Under certain other conditions, as specified in the joint venture agreements with Merck, the Company could earn additional milestones totaling $105 million. It should be noted that the Company incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income from the cholesterol joint venture and instead are included in the overall cost structure of the Company. Provision for Income Taxes Tax expense was $228 million, $779 million, and $46 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The overall income tax expense in 2005, net of the benefit described below, primarily related to foreign taxes and does not include any benefit related to U.S. Net Operating Losses (NOLs). The Company has established a valuation allowance on net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. NOLs, as management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had U.S. NOL carryforwards totaling approximately $1.5 billion. The Companys tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a U.S. federal income tax benefit of approximately $42 million as a result of an IRS Notice issued in August 2005. The provisions of this Notice resulted in a reduction of the previously accrued tax liability attributable to the AJCA repatriation, and also reduced the 2005 U.S. NOLs carried forward to subsequent years. The 2005 income tax provision includes a charge of approximately $260 million related to foreign taxes, $14 million for state taxes and a benefit of $46 million for U.S. federal taxes primarily related to the 2005 IRS Notice mentioned above. In January 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of the Companys 1993 1996 federal income tax returns. The Company had made a cash payment in the third quarter of 2005 in the form of a tax deposit of approximately $239 million in anticipation of the settlement of the 1993 1996 tax examination and to prevent additional IRS interest charges. This payment fully satisfied the liability associated with the tax examination and was consistent with the previously recorded reserves. The IRS is currently examining the Companys 1997 2002 federal income tax returns. 35 Table of Contents Net Income/(Loss) Available to Common Shareholders Net income available to common shareholders for 2005 includes the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $86 million related to the issuance of the 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in August 2004. The 2004 net loss available to common shareholders includes the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $34 million. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow from operating activities $ 882 $ (154 ) $ 601 Cash flow from investing activities (454 ) (621 ) (790 ) Cash flow from financing activities (633 ) 1,534 882 In 2005, cash flow from operating activities on a worldwide basis approximated cash payments for capital expenditures and dividends. International operations generate cash in excess of local cash needs. However, U.S. operations have cash needs well in excess of cash generated in the U.S. The U.S. operations must fund dividend payments, the majority of research and development costs and U.S. capital expenditures. In years prior to 2003, overall U.S. cash needs were funded primarily through operations. Cash requirements during 2005 in the U.S. including operating cash needs, capital expenditures, tax payments and dividends on common and preferred shares approximated $1.1 billion. In 2005, consolidated operating activities generated $882 million of cash, compared with a use of $154 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher net income and timing of payments of special charges related to litigation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to sales growth, payments to tax authorities for tax liabilities related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA of approximately $375 million and tax deposits of $239 million for the anticipated settlement of certain tax contingencies for the tax years 1993 through 1996. Tax charges related to the AJCA were expensed in 2004. In 2004, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a U.S. tax refund of $404 million as a result of loss carry back. However, cash flow was unfavorably impacted by a $473 million payment to the U.S. government for a tax deficiency related to certain transactions in tax years 1991 to 1992 and the payment of $294 million under the settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorneys office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 2003, operating activities provided approximately $601 million of cash. This amount includes the cash flow benefit from the reduction in accounts receivable following the end of sales of CLARITIN as a prescription product in the U.S. This amount also includes a $250 million payment under the terms of the FDA Consent Decree. Net cash used for investing activities during 2005 was $454 million, primarily related to $478 million of capital expenditures and the purchase of intangible assets of $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $43 million and the net reduction in short term investments of $33 million. Net cash used for investing activities in 2004 was $621 million and included capital expenditures of $489 million and net purchases of investments of $264 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $118 million from the transfer of license rights and $7 million from the dispositions of property and equipment. Net cash used for financing activities during 2005 was $633 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.5 billion in 2004. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2005 include the 36 Table of Contents payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $410 million and the repayment of $1.2 billion of commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by proceeds of $900 million from bank debt incurred by a foreign subsidiary related to funding of a portion of the repatriations under the AJCA during 2005. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 reflected proceeds of $1.4 billion from the preferred stock issuance and $546 million from the increase in short term borrowings, partially offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $354 million. As the Companys financial situation has begun to improve, the Company is moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business. This includes expected capital expenditures of up to $300 million over the next several years for a pharmaceutical sciences center. This center will allow the Company to streamline and integrate the Companys drug development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to market. There will be additional related expenditures to upgrade equipment and staffing for this center. In 2006, the U.S. operations will continue to generate negative cash flow. Payments regarding litigation and investigations could increase cash needs. Operating cash flows, existing cash and investments, including repatriations made during 2005 under the AJCA, are expected to provide the Company with the ability to fund cash needs, including U.S. cash needs, for the near and intermediate term. Total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments less total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005. In August 2004 the Company issued 6 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock (see Note 14, Shareholders Equity, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) and received net proceeds of $1.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. The proceeds were used to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings, pay tax and litigation settlement amounts and litigation costs, and to fund operating expenses, shareholder dividends and capital expenditures. The preferred stock was issued under the Companys $2.0 billion shelf registration. As of December 31, 2005, $563 million remains registered and unissued under the shelf registration. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, the Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and A+ (on Credit Watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poors (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moodys or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A , respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 12, Short Term Borrowings, Long Term Debt and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K, for additional information. On July 14, 2004, Moodys lowered its rating on the notes to Baa1. Accordingly, the interest payable on each note increased 25 basis points effective December 1, 2004. Therefore, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. This adjustment to the interest rate payable on the notes increased the Companys interest expense by approximately $6 million annually. The Company has a revolving credit facility from a syndicate of major financial institutions. During March 2005, the Company negotiated an increase in the bank commitments from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion with no changes in the basic terms of the pre existing credit facility. Concurrently with the increase in commitments under this facility, the Company terminated early a separate $250 million line of credit which would have matured in May 2006. There was no outstanding balance under this facility at the time it was terminated. 37 Table of Contents The existing $1.5 billion credit facility matures in May 2009 and requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered as support to the Companys commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances, however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. As of December 31, 2005, $325 million has been drawn under this facility by a wholly owned international subsidiary for the purposes of funding AJCA related repatriations. In addition to the aforementioned credit facility, the Company entered into a $575 million credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2005, all of which was drawn as of December 31, 2005. This credit facility was utilized by a wholly owned international subsidiary to fund repatriations under the AJCA. This credit facility requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent. These borrowings are payable no later than November 4, 2008. Any funds borrowed under this facility which are subsequently repaid may not be re borrowed. All credit facility borrowings have been classified as short term borrowings as the Company intends to repay these amounts in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, short term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $298 million and $1.46 billion, respectively. The weighted average interest rate for short term borrowings at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 4.7 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. Credit Ratings The Companys current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long term Short term Outlook Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Negative Standard and Poors A A 2 Negative Fitch Ratings A F 2 Negative The commercial paper ratings discussed above have not significantly affected the Companys ability to issue or rollover its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, the Company believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as the Company, with one or more short term credit ratings of P 2 from Moodys, A 2 from S&P and or F2 from Fitch to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers is typically less than that of higher rated companies. The Company maintains sizable lines of credit with commercial banks, as well as cash and short term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries, to serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. The Companys credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on the Companys short and long term debt. As discussed above, the Company believes that existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will allow the Company to fund its U.S. cash needs for the near and intermediate term. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period under the Companys known contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More than than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt $ 1,278 $ 1,278 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations(1) 2,399 2 1 2,396 Operating lease obligations 249 76 108 33 32 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 107 107 Research contracts(2) 161 140 12 7 2 Capital expenditure commitments 179 175 4 Other purchase obligations(3) 829 778 25 9 17 Other obligations(4) 912 269 170 25 448 Total $ 6,114 $ 2,823 $ 321 $ 75 $ 2,895 (1) Long term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033 and excludes interest obligations. See Note 12, Short Term Borrowings, Long Term Debt and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K, for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by the Company without penalty. (3) Other purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non cancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of the Companys pension and deferred compensation plans, preferred stock dividends and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. These regulations are described in more detail in Part I, Item I, Business, of this 10 K. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Since 2002, the Company has been working under a U.S. FDA Consent Decree to resolve issues involving the Companys compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its 39 Table of Contents manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. See details in Note 18, Consent Decree under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, the Company made payments totaling $500 million. As of the end of 2005, the Company has completed the revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products, as well as all 212 Significant Steps of the cGMP Work Plan, in accordance with the schedules required by the Consent Decree. The Companys completion of the cGMP Work Plan is currently pending certification by a third party expert, whose certification is in turn subject to acceptance by the FDA. Under the terms of the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified the Company of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in the five year period since the Decrees entry, May 2002 through May 2007, the Company may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and FDA will not oppose the Companys petition. The Company is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the European Union (EU) and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug, in order to alert the manufacturer of the drug and the governmental agency to potential problems. During 2003, pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) cited serious deficiencies in reporting processes. The Company has continued to work on its long term action plan to rectify the deficiencies and has provided regular updates to the EMEA. During the fourth quarter 2005, local UK and EMEA regulatory authorities conducted a follow up inspection to assess the Companys implementation of its action plan. The inspectors acknowledged that progress had been made since 2003, but also continued to note significant concerns with the quality systems supporting the Companys pharmacovigilance processes. Similarly, in a follow up inspection of the Companys clinical trial practices in the UK, inspectors identified issues with respect to the Companys management of clinical trials and related pharmacovigilance practices. The Company intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. The Company remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Further, in February 2006, the Company announced a 2006 initiative for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which will strengthen the Companys scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. The Company does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to the inspections. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against the Company and or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for the Companys products. Recently, clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. Company personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Following this wake of recent product withdrawals of other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA have increased their focus on safety, when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re reviewing select products which are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising and promotion and in particular direct to consumer advertising. 40 Table of Contents Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA in Japan, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products, including the initial approval of ZETIA in Japan, and has added to the uncertainty in predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. In 2005, the FDA issued a Final Rule removing the essential use designation for albuterol CFC products. The removal of this designation requires that all CFC albuterol products, including the Companys PROVENTIL CFC, be removed from the market no later than December 31, 2008. This will necessitate a transition in the marketplace from albuterol CFC (PROVENTIL) to albuterol HFA (PROVENTIL HFA) no later than the end of 2008. It is difficult to predict what impact this transition will have on the albuterol marketplace and the Companys products. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect the Companys operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. The Company has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, CLARINEX D 24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D 12 and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the United States, NOXAFIL in the EU, PEG INTRON in Japan and new indications for REMICADE. The Company also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval. As described more specifically in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of the Company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. The Company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of the Companys pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In the U.S. market, the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government funded programs. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across the board price 41 Table of Contents cuts as methods to control costs. For example, Japan generally enacts biennial price reductions and this is expected to occur again in 2006. Pricing actions will occur in 2006 in certain major European markets. Since the Company is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The new Medicare Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D), which took effect January 1, 2006, offers voluntary prescription drug coverage, subsidized by Medicare, to over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries through competing private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Many of the Companys leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g., TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON A). Medicare Part B provides payment for physician services which can include prescription drugs administered along with other physician services. The manner in which drugs are reimbursed under Medicare Part B may limit the Companys ability to offer larger price concessions or make large price increases on these drugs. Other Schering Plough drugs have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g., CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). The Company could experience expanded utilization of VYTORIN and ZETIA and new drugs in the Companys R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for the Company may be the legislations impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. The Companys operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as the Companys products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2006 OUTLOOK As it relates to financial performance, the Company anticipates that sales and profits of its pivotal cholesterol franchise will continue to grow in 2006. The Companys gross margin improved in 2005 as a result of, among other things, operating efficiencies in its plants and reduced spending related to the Consent Decree. The improvement in gross margin is expected to moderate in 2006 and improvements may be offset by royalty payments to partners. The Company anticipates that R&D expenses may grow at a faster rate than net sales in 2006, but will depend on the timing of studies and the success of Phase II trials now underway for the Thrombin Receptor Antagonist, the Hepatitis Protease Inhibitor and the HIV drug vicriviroc. As the Company moves forward in the Action Agenda, additional investments are anticipated to enhance the infrastructure in areas such as clinical development, pharmacovigilance and information technology. The risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors could cause actual results to differ from the expectations provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 151, Inventory Costs. This SFAS requires that abnormal spoilage be expensed in the period incurred (as 42 Table of Contents opposed to inventoried and amortized to income over inventory usage) and that fixed production facility overhead costs be allocated over the normal production level of a facility. The Company implemented SFAS 151 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The implementation of this SFAS did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) for SFAS 143, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, to clarify the term conditional asset retirement obligations, as used in SFAS 143. This term refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Accordingly, a company is required to recognize liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. This interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. Retroactive application is not required. The Company implemented FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The implementation of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is effective for the Company on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize compensation costs related to all share based transactions as well as compensation based on the market performance of Company shares on a fair value basis. The Company will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method. The modified prospective method requires the Company to recognize compensation costs on all share based grants made on or after January 1, 2006 as well as the unrecognized cost of unvested awards at the date of adoption. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company will recognize share based compensation costs over the service period, which is the earlier of the employees retirement eligibility date or the stated vesting period of the award. For grants issued to retirement eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company will recognize compensation costs over the stated vesting period with acceleration of any unrecognized compensation costs upon the retirement of the employee. SFAS 123R also amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits that had been reflected as operating cash flows be reflected as financing cash flows. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K presents pro forma disclosures reflecting the effect on net income/(loss) as if stock based compensation had been applied under the SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, fair value method. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Companys 2006 compensation expense for stock options and deferred stock units is expected to be consistent with 2005 pro forma amounts but could be lower based on the timing and number of individual grants, the Companys stock price and other assumptions necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, the Company has two compensation plans that will be accounted for under SFAS 123R as liability based plans. The ultimate cash payout of these liability based plans will be based on the Companys stock price performance as compared to the stock price performance of its peer group. This change in accounting required by SFAS 123R will result in a cumulative effect of $26 million in income at January 1, 2006, in order to recognize the difference between the Companys previously accrued liability as reported under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion Number 25 and the fair value of the liability for these plans. Future operating results will be impacted by the fluctuation in the fair value of the liability under these plans, which is required to be remeasured at each reporting date. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following accounting policies are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the Companys financial statements: Revenue Recognition Rebates, Discounts and Returns Provision for Income Taxes 43 Table of Contents Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Accounting for Pensions and Post retirement Benefit Plans Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition The Companys pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers (e.g., wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations). Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies as well as to indirect purchasers and other market participants (e.g., managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers). The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs and; iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. When recognizing revenue, the Company estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re evaluated as part of this process. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, the Company defers the recognition of revenue. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, the Company would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed care organizations and government purchasers as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. During 2004, the Company entered into agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers. These agreements deal with a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of this monitoring and the above noted agreements, the Company expects to avoid situations where the Companys shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Rebate accruals for federal and state governmental programs were $144 million at December 31, 2005 and $155 million at December 31, 2004. Commercial discounts and other rebate accruals were 44 Table of Contents $378 million at December 31, 2005, and $382 million at December 31, 2004. These and other rebate accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, the Companys payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy the Companys obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 537 $ 594 Provision for Rebates 479 486 Payments (495 ) (524 ) (16 ) (38 ) Provision for Returns 116 277 Returns (167 ) (321 ) (51 ) (44 ) Provision for Discounts 459 294 Discounts granted (407 ) (269 ) 52 25 Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, End of Period $ 522 $ 537 Management makes estimates and uses assumptions in recording the above accruals. Actual amounts paid in the current period were consistent with those previously estimated. Certain prior year amounts have been conformed to reflect the current year presentation. Provision for Income Taxes As of December 31, 2005, taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.1 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the Company considers these earnings permanently reinvested in its international subsidiaries. The Companys potential tax exposures result from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property). Although the Companys cross border arrangements between affiliates are based upon internationally accepted standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters could materially affect shareholders equity, liquidity and or cash flows. The Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years, based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities. The Company accrues liabilities for identified tax contingencies that result from tax positions taken that could be challenged by tax authorities. While the Company believes that its tax reserves reflect the probable 45 Table of Contents outcome of identified tax contingencies, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amount accrued. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or an additional portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should the Company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or an additional portion of its remaining net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $569 million at December 31, 2005. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $50 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2005. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Many of the Companys manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the Consent Decree and other compliance activities. The Companys manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce the Companys manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. In most cases, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction, revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and or related costs. Accounting for Pension and Post retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. The Company assesses its pension and other post retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, the Company considers many factors including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, the Companys historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (see Note 6, Retirement Plans and Other Post retirement Benefits, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10 K, for additional information). Discount rates used for pension and other post retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate at the measurement date of a high quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. Actuarial assumptions are based upon managements best estimates and judgment. An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $21 million favorable impact on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. An increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $8 million favorable impact on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. 46 Table of Contents The expected rates of return for the pension and other post retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long term historical data as well as the Companys actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the Companys expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market related value of assets ratably over a five year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. The targeted investment portfolio of the Companys U.S. pension plan is allocated 65 percent to equities, 28 percent to fixed income investments and 7 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of the Companys U.S. other post retirement benefit plans is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios equity weightings are consistent with the long term nature of the plans benefit obligations. For non U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. The Company reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, the Company may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of the Company. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company has subsidiaries in more than 50 countries. In 2005, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 62 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, the Companys reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because the Companys international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that the Companys international operations are widespread. 47 Table of Contents In addition, at any point in time, the Companys international subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term, third party and intercompany, receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect the translated value of these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, the Company has used derivatives to hedge specific short term risk situations involving foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short term investments and the debt and equity securities held in non qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled $5.7 billion at December 31, 2005. For cash equivalents and short term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $15 million. For securities held in non qualified trusts, due to the long term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, the Companys exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short term borrowings. The Company maintains an investment portfolio in excess of the amount of borrowings. Accordingly, the Company has mitigated its exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. The Company has long term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt by approximately $120 million. However, the Company does not expect to refund this debt.
