Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of Schering Plough Schering Plough discovers, develops, manufactures and markets medical therapies and treatments to enhance human health. Schering Plough also markets leading consumer brands in the over the counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and operates a global animal health business. There are two sources of new products: products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements, and products in Schering Ploughs late stage research pipeline. With respect to acquisitions and licensing, Schering Plough has recently acquired some new product licenses. However, there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late stage products that will have a positive material financial impact. These limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding. Schering Plough often competes for these opportunities against companies with greater financial resources. Strategy Focused on Science Earlier this decade, Schering Plough experienced a number of business, regulatory, and legal challenges. In April 2003, the Board of Directors named Fred Hassan as the new Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering Plough Corporation. With support from the Board, he recruited a new senior executive team and initiated a strategic plan, with the goal of stabilizing, repairing and turning around Schering Plough in order to build long term shareholder value. That strategic plan, the Action Agenda, is a six to eight year, five phase plan. In October 2006, Schering Plough announced that it entered the fourth phase of the Action Agenda Build the Base. During the Build the Base phase, Schering Plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front, including: growing the business; penetrating new markets; expanding existing products; and discovering and developing or acquiring new products. As part of this effort, Schering Plough is enhancing infrastructure, upgrading processes and systems, and strengthening talent both the recruitment of talented individuals and the development of key employees. While these efforts are companywide, Schering Plough is focusing especially on research and development. A key component of the Action Agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. As a result, a core strategy of Schering Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments with important medical and commercial value. Consistent with this core strategy, Schering Plough has been increasing its investment in research and development. Schering Ploughs progressing pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas with 21 compounds now approaching or in Phase I development. As Schering Plough continues to develop the later phase growth drivers of the pipeline (e.g., thrombin receptor antagonist, golimumab, vicriviroc and HCV protease inhibitor), it anticipates higher spending on clinical trial activities. 2006 Results Highlights of Schering Ploughs performance in 2006 are as follows: Schering Ploughs net sales in 2006 were $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 11 percent, as compared to the 2005 period. Net Income Available to Common Shareholders in 2006 was $1.1 billion, as compared to $183 million in 2005. Cash flow from operating activities was $2.2 billion in 2006. Global sales of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, made by the cholesterol joint venture with Merck & Company, Inc. (Merck) continued to grow in 2006 and significantly contributed to Schering Ploughs improved operating results and cash flow. In addition, increased sales of 28 Table of Contents pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE, NASONEX, TEMODAR, and CLARINEX also contributed favorably to Schering Ploughs overall operating results and cash flow. Schering Plough gained approvals for new products and indications, including for the life saving antifungal medicine NOXAFIL Oral Suspension in the United States and EU for the prevention of invasive fungal infections (NOXAFIL was discovered in Schering Ploughs research laboratories); TEMODAL in Japan for the treatment of a form of brain cancer, malignant glioma; REMICADE in the EU for ulcerative colitis; and SUBOXONE Sublingual Tablets in the EU for opioid dependence. Schering Plough streamlined the global supply chain to yield expected annualized cost savings of about $100 million. Schering Plough reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle a previously disclosed investigation that related to actions that took place prior to 2003. The agreement provided for an aggregate settlement amount of $435 million. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on Schering Ploughs results of operations, financial condition or its business. Strategic Alliances As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Schering Plough licenses manufacturing, marketing and or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of Schering Plough that may create positive or negative impacts on Schering Plough. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to Schering Ploughs current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(r) to Schering Ploughs 10 K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(v) to Schering Ploughs 10 K. Cholesterol Franchise Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are managed through a joint venture between Schering Plough and Merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. ZETIA is Schering Ploughs novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor, Mercks statin medication. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck, and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. A material change in the sales or market share of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise would have a significant impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations and cash flows. In order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business, Schering Plough must continue to increase profits. This increased profitability is largely dependent upon the performance of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise. The cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market and, on a combined basis, these products continued to grow in terms of market share during 2006. As a franchise, the two products together have captured more than 15 percent of total prescriptions for the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2007 IMS data). Japan is not included in the joint venture with Merck. In the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare will co market Schering Ploughs cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, upon approval. Schering Plough anticipates receiving this approval in Japan in 2007, but due to a backlog of new drug applications in Japan, Schering Plough cannot precisely predict the timing of the approval. 29 Table of Contents License Arrangements with Centocor REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. REMICADE is Schering Ploughs second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). REMICADE is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. Schering Plough has the exclusive marketing rights to this product outside of the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. During 2005, Schering Plough exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a new TNF alpha monoclonal antibody, in the same territories as REMICADE. Golimumab is currently in Phase III trials. Schering Plough and Centocor have been collaborating in resolving the difference in the parties opinions as to the expiration date of Schering Ploughs rights to golimumab. In August 2006, Schering Plough received a determination through arbitration that its rights to market golimumab will extend to 15 years after the first commercial sales in its territories, but Centocor has appealed the ruling. Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Schering Plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. Schering Plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the drug development process (where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets), information technology systems, and post marketing studies and monitoring. Schering Plough continually reviews the business, including manufacturing operations, to identify actions that will enhance long term competitiveness. However, Schering Ploughs manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed, and actions to significantly reduce Schering Ploughs manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. During 2006, Schering Plough closed one manufacturing plant and took other streamlining actions. Schering Plough continues to review the carrying value of manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments or related costs. Regulatory and Competitive Environment Schering Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. Regulatory compliance is complex and costly, impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Since 2002, Schering Plough has been working under a U.S. FDA Consent Decree to resolve issues involving Schering Ploughs compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. Under the terms of the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified Schering Plough of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in any five year period since the Decrees entry in May 2002, Schering Plough may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and FDA will not oppose Schering Ploughs petition. There is no assurance about any particular date when the Consent Decree will be lifted. Schering Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. Schering Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. Research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., the EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. The pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. 30 Table of Contents In the U.S., many of Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering Ploughs operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering Ploughs products mature. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition to these fluctuations, sales of many pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups, institutions, government agencies, and other groups seeking discounts. Schering Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the U.S. market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the Medicaid program, the veterans health care program, and other government funded programs. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost containment programs, placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. Consolidated net sales in 2006 were $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 11 percent as compared to 2005. The increase primarily reflected the growth in sale volumes of REMICADE, NASONEX, PEG INTRON and TEMODAR. This increase also reflected an unfavorable impact of 1 percent from foreign exchange. Consolidated net sales in 2005 totaled $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 15 percent compared to 2004, reflecting higher volumes of REMICADE, NASONEX, PEG INTRON, TEMODAR and the inclusion of a full year of sales of AVELOX and CIPRO. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 1 percent. 31 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 (Dollars in millions) PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 8,561 $ 7,564 $ 6,417 13 % 18 % REMICADE 1,240 942 746 32 26 NASONEX 944 737 594 28 24 PEG INTRON 837 751 563 11 33 CLARINEX/AERIUS 722 646 692 12 (7 ) TEMODAR 703 588 459 20 28 CLARITIN Rx 356 371 321 (4 ) 16 INTEGRILIN 329 315 325 5 (3 ) REBETOL 311 331 287 (6 ) 15 AVELOX 304 228 44 34 N/M INTRON A 237 287 318 (17 ) (10 ) CAELYX 206 181 150 13 21 SUBUTEX 203 197 185 3 6 ELOCON 141 144 168 (2 ) (14 ) CIPRO 111 146 43 (24 ) N/M Other Pharmaceutical 1,917 1,700 1,522 13 12 CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,123 1,093 1,085 3 1 OTC 558 556 578 N/M (4 ) Foot Care 343 333 331 3 1 Sun Care 222 204 176 9 16 ANIMAL HEALTH 910 851 770 7 11 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 10,594 $ 9,508 $ 8,272 11 % 15 % N/M Not a meaningful percentage. International net sales of REMICADE, a drug for the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis, were up 32 percent to $1.2 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 26 percent in 2005 to $942 million as compared to 2004, due to greater demand, expanded indications and continued market growth. During 2006, competitive products for the indications referred to above have been introduced, and additional competitive products are expected to be introduced in 2007. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 28 percent to $944 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 24 percent to $737 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share in both 2006 and 2005. In 2005, U.S. sales benefited from an increased promotional effort and the introduction of a new scent free, alcohol free formulation of NASONEX nasal spray. A generic form of Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved early in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market going forward. Global net sales of PEG INTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, increased 11 percent to $837 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 33 percent to $751 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. The sales increase in 2006 reflected higher sales volume in Japan and the U.S. Sales growth in 2005 was due to the December 2004 launch of the PEG INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from a significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG INTRON before beginning treatment. PEG INTRON sales in Japan have begun to decline toward the end of 2006, 32 Table of Contents and this trend is expected to continue into 2007 as new patient enrollment for hepatitis C treatment moderates and new competition enters the Japanese market. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year round indoor allergies, increased 12 percent to $722 million as compared to 2005 due to increased demand in Europe and Latin America as well as increased sales in the U.S. despite slightly declining market share. Global net sales of CLARINEX in 2005 decreased 7 percent to $646 million as compared to 2004 primarily due to reduced market share in a declining market in the U.S. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 20 percent to $703 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and increased 28 percent to $588 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increases in 2006 and 2005 sales were due to the increased utilization for new indications. In 2005, TEMODAR was approved by the U.S. FDA for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most prevalent form of brain cancer, and by the European Commission for use in combination with radiotherapy for GBM patients in 25 EU member states as well as in Iceland and Norway. In 2006, TEMODAR was approved in Japan for the treatment of malignant glioma. The growth rates for TEMODAR are expected to moderate, as significant market penetration has already been achieved in the treatment of GBM. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN decreased 4 percent to $356 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Sales in 2005 increased 16 percent to $371 million as compared to 2004 due to the launch of CLARITIN REDITABS in Japan coupled with an unusually severe Japanese allergy season during 2005. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough, increased 5 percent to $329 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. During 2005, sales decreased 3 percent to $315 million as compared to 2004. Effective September 1, 2005, Schering Plough restructured its INTEGRILIN co promotion agreement with Millennium. Under the terms of the restructured agreement, Schering Plough acquired exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in exchange for an upfront payment of $36 million and royalties on INTEGRILIN sales. The restructured agreement calls for minimum royalty payments of $85 million per year to Millennium in 2006 and 2007. Global 2006 net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with PEG INTRON or INTRON A for treating hepatitis C, decreased 6 percent to $311 million as compared to 2005 due to lower sales in Europe and increased competition. Global net sales in 2005 increased 15 percent to $331 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to the launch of the PEG INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan in December 2004. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG INTRON before beginning hepatitis C treatment. Sales are expected to continue to decline as a result of the moderation of hepatitis C patient enrollments in Japan and as new competition enters the Japanese market. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, increased 34 percent to $304 million in 2006 as compared to $228 million in 2005 due to share growth and new indications. Sales of AVELOX in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer, which was effective October 1, 2004. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 17 percent to $237 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 10 percent in 2005 to $287 million as compared to 2004, due to the conversion to PEG INTRON for treating hepatitis C in Japan. International net sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposis sarcoma, increased 13 percent to $206 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an expanding market for this product. Sales in 2005 increased 21 percent to $181 million as compared to 2004, reflecting further adoption of the ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer indications. International net sales of SUBUTEX Tablets, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 3 percent to $203 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to increased market share. Sales increased 6 percent to $197 million 33 Table of Contents in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased market penetration. In October 2006, SUBOXONE was approved by the EU, including the 25 member states as well as Iceland and Norway, for the treatment of opioid dependence. Global net sales of ELOCON cream, a medium potency topical steroid, decreased 2 percent to $141 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and decreased 14 percent to $144 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, reflecting generic competition that was introduced in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2005. Generic competition is expected to continue to adversely affect sales of this product. Net sales of CIPRO, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory, skin, urinary tract and other infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, decreased 24 percent to $111 million in 2006 as compared to $146 million in 2005 due to market share erosion from generic competition. Sales of CIPRO in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. These products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Included in other pharmaceutical sales is sales of Schering Ploughs albuterol products. In 2005, the FDA issued a Final Rule that requires all CFC albuterol products, including Schering Ploughs PROVENTIL CFC, be removed from the market no later than December 31, 2008. Schering Plough and other manufacturers of albuterol CFC have to transition to albuterol HFA (PROVENTIL HFA) prior to this 2008 year end deadline. Schering Plough has begun the transition to the HFA product. Schering Plough is uncertain as to the ultimate impact on Schering Ploughs overall future sales of PROVENTIL products, due to the complexities and multiple external factors influencing this transition, including competing albuterol HFA products. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased 3 percent or $30 million as compared to 2005 reflecting an increase in sales of sun care products and DR. SCHOLLS and other foot care products. Sales were $1.1 billion in 2005 and 2004. Sales of OTC CLARITIN decreased 1 percent to $390 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 6 percent to $394 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of the restrictions on the retail sale of OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (PSE). In addition, OTC CLARITIN continues to face competition from private labels and branded loratadine. Net sales of sun care products increased $18 million or 9 percent in 2006 as compared to 2005, and $28 million or 16 percent in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to the success of new COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products launched in 2005. Sales of sun care products in 2005 also reflected a stronger overall suncare season in the U.S. Future sales are difficult to predict because the consumer health care market is highly competitive, with heavy advertising to consumers and frequent competitive product introductions. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 7 percent to $910 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 11 percent in 2005 to $851 million as compared to 2004, reflecting strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas led by higher sales of companion animal products in 2006 while the products serving the U.S. cattle market, including NUFLOR, and the vaccine business led sales growth in 2005. The increased net sales were also due in part to better product supply in the U.S. Schering Plough expects this growth rate to moderate due to increased competition, including the introduction of generic products. 34 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin 65.1 % 64.8 % 62.9 % 0.3 % 1.9 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) $ 4,718 $ 4,374 $ 3,811 7.9 % 14.8 % Research and development (R&D) 2,188 1,865 1,607 17.3 % 16.1 % Other (income)/expense, net (135 ) 5 146 N/M N/M Special charges 102 294 153 N/M N/M Equity income from cholesterol joint venture (1,459 ) (873 ) (347 ) N/M N/M N/M Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in Schering Ploughs net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income from cholesterol joint venture. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, Schering Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in Schering Ploughs Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, Schering Ploughs gross margin, and ratios of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the joint ventures operating results. Gross margin Despite negative impacts on cost of sales from the costs resulting from Schering Ploughs actions to streamline its manufacturing operations during 2006, gross margin increased to 65.1 percent in 2006 from 64.8 percent in 2005. This improvement in gross margin is primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and process improvements within Schering Ploughs supply chain, including cost savings from the manufacturing streamlining activities completed during 2006. In 2006, cost of sales included charges totaling $146 million associated with Schering Ploughs actions to streamline its manufacturing operations, offset by savings of approximately $30 million as a result of these actions. See Note 2, Special Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for additional information. Gross margin increased to 64.8 percent in 2005 from 62.9 percent in 2004, primarily due to supply chain process improvements, increased sales of higher margin products and a favorable impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by higher royalties related to the Bayer products and, beginning September 1, 2005, royalties for INTEGRILIN. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 8 percent to $4.7 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, reflecting ongoing investments in emerging markets and field support for product launches as well as higher promotional spending. SG&A expenses increased 15 percent to $4.4 billion in 2005 as compared to $3.8 billion in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the addition in the 2004 fourth quarter of Bayer sales representatives, increased selling expenses in Europe to support the continued launch of VYTORIN and ZETIA, and increased promotional spending, primarily for NASONEX, ASMANEX and the products under the agreement with Bayer. Research and development Research and development (R&D) spending increased 17 percent to $2.2 billion in 2006 as compared to the 2005 period. In 2005, R&D spending increased 16 percent to $1.9 billion as compared to the 2004 period. The 2006 increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical trials as well as building greater breadth and capacity to support Schering Ploughs progressing pipeline. The 2005 increase is partially due to a $124 million charge in the third quarter of 2005 resulting from Schering Ploughs exercise of its rights to develop and commercialize golimumab. R&D spending for 2004 included an $80 million charge in conjunction with the license from Toyama 35 Table of Contents Chemical Company Ltd. for garenoxacin. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of Schering Ploughs funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. To maximize Schering Ploughs chances for the successful development of new products, Schering Plough began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high priority programs within R&D. In 2006, Schering Plough began a Global Clinical Harmonization Program to maximize and globalize the quality of clinical trial execution, pharmacovigilance and regulatory processes. Other (income)/expense, net Schering Plough had other income, net, of $135 million in 2006 as compared to other expense, net, of $5 million and $146 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to higher interest rates on larger overall balances of cash equivalents and short term investments. Special charges and Manufacturing Streamlining 2006 Manufacturing Streamlining During 2006, Schering Plough implemented changes to its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and New Jersey to streamline its global supply chain and further enhance Schering Ploughs long term competitiveness. These changes resulted in the phase out and closure of Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations in Manati, Puerto Rico, and additional workforce reductions in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and New Jersey. In total, these actions have resulted in the elimination of over 1,000 positions. Schering Plough expects these actions to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $100 million. Special Charges: Special charges in 2006 related to the changes in Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations totaled $102 million. These charges consisted of approximately $47 million of severance and $55 million of fixed asset impairments. Cost of Sales: Included in 2006 cost of sales was approximately $146 million consisting of $93 million of accelerated depreciation, $46 million of inventory write offs, and $7 million of other charges related to the closure of Schering Ploughs manufacturing facilities in Manati, Puerto Rico. The following table summarizes activities reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to changes to Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations which were completed in 2006: Charges included in Special Total Cash Non Cash Accrued Cost of Sales Charges Charges Payments Charges Liability (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at January 1, 2006 $ Severance $ $ 47 $ 47 $ (35 ) $ 12 Asset impairments 55 55 (55 ) Accelerated depreciation 93 93 (93 ) Inventory write offs 46 46 (46 ) Other 7 7 (2 ) (5 ) Total $ 146 $ 102 $ 248 $ (37 ) $ (199 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2006 $ 12 The accrued liability balance at December 31, 2006, is expected to be paid during the first quarter of 2007. Schering Plough does not expect to incur any material additional charges related to the manufacturing streamlining actions announced in 2006. 36 Table of Contents 2004 2005 Special Charge Activities Special charges incurred in 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Litigation charges $ 250 $ Employee termination costs 28 119 Asset impairment and other charges 16 34 $ 294 $ 153 Litigation charges: In 2005, litigation reserves were increased by $250 million. This increase resulted in a total reserve of $500 million for the Massachusetts Investigation, as well as the investigations and the state litigation disclosed under AWP Litigation and Investigations in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, representing Schering Ploughs then current estimate to resolve this matter. On August 29, 2006, Schering Plough announced it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the Massachusetts Investigation for an aggregate amount of $435 million plus interest. This settlement amount relates only to the Massachusetts Investigation. The AWP investigations and litigation are ongoing. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, Schering Plough made payments totaling $388 million related to this settlement including interest of $12 million. Substantially all the remaining payments under this settlement agreement will be paid in the remainder of 2007. See Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. Employee termination costs: In August 2003, Schering Plough announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. Under this program, eligible employees in the U.S. had until December 15, 2003, to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, all of which retired by December 31, 2005. The total cost of this program was approximately $191 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $108 million, increased post retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of $22 million. Amounts recognized in 2005 and 2004 for this program were $7 million and $20 million, respectively. No additional amounts are expected to be recognized under this program. Termination costs not associated with the VERP totaled $21 million and $99 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs: Employee Termination Costs (Dollars in millions) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2003 $ 29 Special charges incurred during 2004 $ 119 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (20 ) Disbursements (110 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2004 $ 18 Special charges incurred during 2005 $ 28 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (7 ) Disbursements (35 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2005 $ 4 Disbursements (4 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2006 $ 37 Table of Contents Asset impairment and other charges: For the year ended December 31, 2005, Schering Plough recognized asset impairment and other charges of $16 million related primarily to the consolidation of Schering Ploughs U.S. biotechnology organizations. Schering Plough recorded asset impairment and other charges of $34 million in 2004, related primarily to the shutdown of a small European research and development facility. Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture Global cholesterol franchise sales, which include sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA, made by the cholesterol joint venture with Merck and Schering Plough totaled $3.9 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.2 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The sales growth in 2006 was due to an increase in market share. The 2005 sales comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. As a franchise, the two products combined have captured more than 15 percent of total prescriptions in the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2007 IMS data). Schering Plough utilizes the equity method of accounting for the joint venture. Sharing of income from operations is based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. Schering Ploughs allocation of joint venture income is increased by milestones earned. Merck and Schering Plough (the Partners) bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the cholesterol agreements provide for a reimbursement to each Partner for physician details that are set on annual basis, and in Italy, a contractual amount is included in the profit sharing calculation that is not reimbursed. These amounts are equal to each Partners physician details multiplied by a contractual fixed fee. Schering Plough reports these amounts as part of equity income from the cholesterol joint venture. These amounts do not represent specific, incremental and identifiable costs for Schering Ploughs detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, these amounts are not reflective of Schering Ploughs sales effort related to the joint venture, as Schering Ploughs sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the Partners contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct to consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out of pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the Partners. Additional information regarding the joint venture with Merck is also included in Note 3, Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Equity income from cholesterol joint venture totaled $1.5 billion, $873 million and $347 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 equity income as compared to 2005 reflecting continued strong sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA. The 2005 equity income comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. During 2005 and 2004, Schering Plough recognized milestones from Merck of $20 million and $7 million, respectively. The $20 million milestone in 2005 related to certain European approvals of VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in 2005. The $7 million milestone in 2004 related to the approval of ezetimibe/simvastatin in Mexico in 2004. Under certain other conditions, as specified in the joint venture agreements with Merck, Schering Plough could earn additional milestones totaling $105 million. It should be noted that Schering Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income from the cholesterol joint venture and instead are included in the overall cost structure of Schering Plough. Provision for Income Taxes Tax expense was $362 million, $228 million and $779 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The tax provisions in 2006, 2005 and 2004 do not include any benefit related to U.S. operating losses. During 2004, Schering Plough established a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. operating losses, as management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. At December 31, 2006, Schering Plough continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its 38 Table of Contents U.S. deferred tax assets. Schering Plough expects to report a U.S. Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of $1.54 billion on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2006. This U.S. NOL carryforward could be materially reduced after examination of Schering Ploughs income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2006, Schering Plough generated approximately $600 million in U.S. operating losses; however, due to differences between financial and tax reporting, the expected NOL to be generated on the 2006 U.S. tax return will be less than the U.S. operating loss for the year. Schering Plough expects to continue to generate U.S. operating losses in 2007; however, the U.S. NOL will be subject to differences between financial and tax reporting. The 2006 and 2005 income tax provision primarily relates to foreign taxes. The 2005 tax provision includes a benefit of $46 million related to an IRS Notice issued in August 2005, which resulted in a reduction of the previously accrued tax liability attributable to repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The 2004 tax provision includes a $417 million charge related to the intended AJCA repatriation that took place in 2005. The IRS is examining Schering Ploughs 1997 2002 federal income tax returns and is in the process of completing that examination. Schering Plough anticipates that the examination will be completed before the end of 2007. The finalization of this IRS audit may result in adjustments to Schering Ploughs accruals for tax contingencies and the U.S. NOLs as reported on Schering Ploughs income tax returns. Schering Ploughs tax reserves reflect its best estimate of the probable tax liability; however, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amount accrued. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Schering Plough is required to apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning on January 1, 2007. The provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all existing uncertain income tax positions on the effective date. Upon the implementation of FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this Interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of Schering Ploughs retained earnings in 2007. Although Schering Plough is still evaluating the potential impact of FIN 48, it expects a decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, from $225 million to $300 million with a corresponding increase to the appropriate tax liability accounts upon the adoption of this Interpretation. Net Income/(Loss) Available to Common Shareholders Schering Plough had net income/(loss) available to common shareholders of $1.1 billion, $183 million and $(981) million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net income available to common shareholders for 2006 and 2005 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $86 million, in each period, related to the issuance of the 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in August 2004. The 2004 net loss available to common shareholders included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $34 million. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2006, 2005 and 2004 also included special charges and manufacturing streamlining costs of approximately $248 million, $294 million and $153 million, respectively. See Note 2, Special Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. In addition, 2006 net income available to common shareholders included an income item of $22 million resulting from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax, related to the implementation of SFAS 123R, Share Based Compensation. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow from operating activities $ 2,161 $ 882 $ (154 ) Cash flow from investing activities (2,908 ) (454 ) (621 ) Cash flow from financing activities (1,361 ) (633 ) 1,534 39 Table of Contents Operating Activities In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion as compared to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher net income and the timing of operating cash payments and receipts. As disclosed in Note 19, Legal, Environment and Regulatory Matters, Schering Plough has reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the Massachusetts Investigation for an aggregate amount of $435 million plus interest. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, Schering Plough made payments totaling $388 million related to this settlement, including interest of $12 million. Substantially all the remaining payments under this settlement agreement will be paid in the remainder of 2007. In 2005, operating activities generated $882 million of cash, compared with a use of $154 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher net income and timing of payments of special charges related to litigation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to sales growth; payments of approximately $375 million to tax authorities for tax liabilities related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA; and tax payments of $239 million related to the settlement of certain tax contingencies for the tax years 1993 through 1996. Tax charges related to the AJCA were expensed in 2004. In 2004, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a U.S. tax refund of $404 million as a result of loss carryback. However, cash flow was unfavorably impacted by a $473 million payment to the U.S. government for a tax deficiency related to certain transactions in tax years 1991 to 1992 and the payment of $294 million under the settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorneys office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during 2006 was $2.9 billion primarily related to the net purchases of short term investments of $2.4 billion previously invested in cash equivalents and $458 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2005 was $454 million, primarily related to $478 million of capital expenditures and the purchase of intangible assets of $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $43 million and the net reduction in short term investments of $33 million. Net cash used for investing activities in 2004 was $621 million and included capital expenditures of $489 million and net purchases of investments of $264 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $118 million from the transfer of license rights and $7 million from the dispositions of property and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during 2006 and 2005 was $1.4 billion and $633 million, respectively. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2006 and 2005 include the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $412 million and $410 million, respectively; the repayment of $1.0 billion of bank debt and short term commercial borrowings in 2006, and $1.2 billion of short term commercial paper borrowings in 2005. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2005 was partially offset by proceeds of $900 million from bank debt incurred by a foreign subsidiary related to funding of a portion of the repatriations under the AJCA during 2005. This bank debt was fully repaid in 2006. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 reflected proceeds of $1.4 billion from the preferred stock issuance and $546 million from the increase in short term borrowings, partially offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $354 million. Other Discussion of Cash Flows Schering Plough is moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business and currently is in the process of building a U.S. pharmaceutical sciences center in New Jersey. Capital expenditures of approximately $38 million were made in 2006 related to this center. Additional capital expenditures of approximately $260 million are expected over the next three years. This center will allow Schering Plough to streamline and integrate its drug development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to market. There will be additional related expenditures to upgrade equipment and staffing for this center. 40 Table of Contents In 2006, U.S. operations generated negative cash flow. U.S. operations have cash needs in excess of cash generated in the U.S. The U.S. operations must fund dividend payments, the majority of research and development costs and U.S. capital expenditures. It is expected that the U.S. operation will also generate negative cash flow in 2007. Total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments less total debt was approximately $3.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Cash generated from operations and available cash and short term investments are expected to provide Schering Plough with the ability to fund cash needs for the intermediate term. 6 Percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock In August 2004, Schering Plough issued 6 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock and received net proceeds of $1.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. The proceeds were used to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings, pay tax and litigation settlement amounts and litigation costs, and to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. The preferred stock was issued under Schering Ploughs $2.0 billion shelf registration, and each preferred share will automatically convert into between 2.2451 and 2.7840 common shares of Schering Plough depending on the average closing price of Schering Ploughs common shares over a period immediately preceding the mandatory conversion date of September 14, 2007, as defined in the prospectus. See Note 15, Shareholders Equity, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. The conversion of these preferred shares will not trigger any cash payment by Schering Plough. At December 31, 2006, $563 million remains registered and un issued under the shelf registration. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, Schering Plough issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and A+ (on Credit Watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poors (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moodys or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A , respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 13, Short Term Borrowings, Long Term Debt and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. On July 14, 2004, Moodys lowered its rating on the notes to Baa1. Accordingly, the interest payable on each note increased 25 basis points effective December 1, 2004. Therefore, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. This adjustment to the interest rate payable on the notes increased Schering Ploughs interest expense by approximately $6 million annually. The interest rate payable on a particular series of notes will return to 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, and the rate adjustment provisions will permanently cease to apply if, following a downgrade by either Moodys or S&P below A3 or A , respectively, the notes are subsequently rated above Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by S&P. Schering Plough has a $1.5 billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This facility matures in May 2009 and requires Schering Plough to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent, which was met at December 31, 2006. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered as support to Schering Ploughs commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances; however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. As of December 31, 2005, $325 million was drawn under this facility by a wholly owned international subsidiary for the purposes of funding repatriations under the AJCA. During 2006, this borrowing amount was fully repaid. As of December 31, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. In addition to the above credit facility, Schering Plough entered into a $575 million credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2005 for the purposes of funding repatriations under the AJCA. As of December 31, 2005, the entire amount was drawn by a wholly owned international subsidiary to fund the repatriations. This facility was paid in full and terminated in 2006. 41 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, short term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $242 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, including outstanding commercial paper of $149 million and $298 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate for short term borrowings at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 6.4 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Credit Ratings Schering Ploughs current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long term Short term Outlook Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Positive Standard and Poors A A 2 Stable Fitch Ratings A F 2 Stable The short term ratings discussed above have not significantly affected Schering Ploughs ability to issue or roll over its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, Schering Plough believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as Schering Plough, with one or more short term credit ratings of P 2 from Moodys, A 2 from S&P and or F 2 from Fitch to issue or roll over outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers is typically less than that of higher rated companies. Schering Ploughs sizable lines of credit with commercial banks as well as cash and short term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Schering Ploughs credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on Schering Ploughs short and long term debt. As discussed above, Schering Plough believes that existing cash, short term investments and cash generated from operations will allow Schering Plough to fund its cash needs for the intermediate term. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Schering Plough has various contractual obligations that are reported as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and others that are not required to be recognized as liabilities such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts. The following table summarizes payments due by period under Schering Ploughs known contractual obligations at December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period Less More Than Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt $ 242 $ 242 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations(1) 2,414 2 3 2 2,407 Operating lease obligations 264 85 106 38 35 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 117 117 Research contracts(2) 141 126 9 4 2 Capital expenditure commitments 181 179 2 Other purchase obligations(3) 1,643 1,562 55 19 7 Deferred compensation plan obligations 85 14 11 18 42 Other obligations(4) 391 247 19 16 109 Total $ 5,478 $ 2,574 $ 205 $ 97 $ 2,602 (1) Long term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033 and excludes interest obligations. See Note 13, Short Term Borrowings, Long Term Debt and 42 Table of Contents Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by Schering Plough without penalty. (3) Other purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non cancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of Schering Ploughs pension plans, preferred stock dividends and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SCHERING PLOUGH OPERATES Schering Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. These regulations are described in more detail in Item 1, Business. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is also costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Much is still unknown about the science of human health and with every drug there are benefits and risks that may be balanced. Societal and government pressures are constantly shifting between the demand for innovation to meet urgent unmet medical needs and adversity to risk. These pressures impact the regulatory environment and the market for Schering Ploughs products. Regulatory Compliance and Pharmacovigilance Consent Decree Since 2002, Schering Plough has been working under a U.S. FDA Consent Decree to resolve issues involving Schering Ploughs compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. See details in Note 18, Consent Decree under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, Schering Plough made payments totaling $500 million. As of the end of 2005, Schering Plough has completed the revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products, as well as all 212 Significant Steps of the cGMP Work Plan, in accordance with the schedules required by the Consent Decree. Schering Plough has obtained third party expert certification of completion of the cGMP Work Plan as required by the Decree. This certification is in turn subject to acceptance by the FDA. Under the terms of the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified Schering Plough of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in any five year period since the Decrees entry in May of 2002, Schering Plough may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and the FDA will not oppose Schering Ploughs petition. There is no assurance about any particular date when the Consent Decree will be lifted. Regulatory Inspections Schering Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the drugs manufacturer and the governmental agency to potential problems. 43 Table of Contents During 2003, pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) cited serious deficiencies in reporting processes. Schering Plough has continued to work on its long term action plan to rectify the deficiencies and has provided regular updates to the EMEA. During the fourth quarter 2005, local UK and EMEA regulatory authorities conducted a follow up inspection to assess Schering Ploughs implementation of its action plan. In the first quarter of 2006, these authorities also inspected the U.S. based components of Schering Ploughs pharmacovigilance system. The inspectors acknowledged that progress had been made since 2003, but also continued to note significant concerns with the quality systems supporting Schering Ploughs pharmacovigilance processes. Similarly, in a follow up inspection of Schering Ploughs clinical trial practices in the UK, inspectors identified issues with respect to Schering Ploughs management of clinical trials and related pharmacovigilance practices. Schering Plough intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. Schering Plough remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Further, in February 2006, Schering Plough began the Global Clinical Harmonization Program for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which will strengthen Schering Ploughs scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. Schering Plough does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to the inspections. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against Schering Plough and or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering Ploughs products. Regulatory Compliance and Post Marketing Surveillance Schering Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. These clinical trial research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, other applicable laws or regulations or quality processes can result in delays in approval of clinical trials, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, delays in approval of marketing authorizations, criminal sanctions against Schering Plough and or responsible individuals, changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering Ploughs products and increased costs. Clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. Schering Ploughs personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Following this wake of recent product withdrawals by other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA in Japan have continued to increase their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and in particular, direct to consumer advertising. Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products, including the initial approval of ZETIA in Japan, and has added to the uncertainty in 44 Table of Contents predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog and has made some progress over the last year, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect Schering Ploughs operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. Schering Plough has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, CLARINEX D 24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D 12 and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the U.S.; NOXAFIL in the U.S., the EU and Australia; PEG INTRON in Japan; and new indications for REMICADE. Schering Plough also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval. Pricing Pressures As described more specifically in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject Schering Plough to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Schering Plough also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In the U.S. market, Schering Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government funded programs. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements; emphasized greater use of generic drugs; and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since Schering Plough is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. Medicare Schering Plough cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The new Medicare Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D), which took effect January 1, 2006, offers voluntary prescription drug coverage, subsidized by Medicare, to more than 40 million Medicare beneficiaries through competing private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Many of Schering Ploughs leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g., TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON 45 Table of Contents A). Medicare Part B provides payment for physician services that can include prescription drugs administered along with other physician services. The manner in which drugs are reimbursed under Medicare Part B may limit Schering Ploughs ability to offer larger price concessions or make large price increases on these drugs. Other Schering Plough drugs have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g., CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). Schering Plough could experience expanded utilization of VYTORIN and ZETIA and new drugs in Schering Ploughs R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for Schering Plough may be the legislations impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. Competition The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering Ploughs operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering Ploughs products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2007 OUTLOOK Schering Plough is on track with the actions to build long term high performance in the Build the Base phase of the Action Agenda. Schering Plough will continue to make investments to support its geographical expansion strategy and plans to make sound promotional investments to continue driving the growth of key brands worldwide. Schering Plough remains focused on controlling its overhead spending and maintaining a right sized sales force for its current opportunities in the U.S. Schering Plough currently does not provide numeric guidance. However, the following outlook may be helpful to readers in assessing future prospects: Currently, the U.S. cholesterol lowering market is adjusting to the entry into the market of multiple generic forms of competing cholesterol products. Despite the introduction of new innovative competing treatments and generic versions of competing products, Schering Plough continues to anticipate that sales from VYTORIN and ZETIA will grow in 2007. The decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and reimbursement policies could negatively impact the dollar size and or growth of the cholesterol management market, including VYTORIN and ZETIA. As Schering Ploughs pipeline continues to progress, it expects that the number of patients in Schering Ploughs clinical trials will increase substantially in 2007. Schering Plough also will continue to invest in research and development with a focus on enhancing infrastructure and upgrading processes, systems and talent. As a result, Schering Plough expects R&D expenses, excluding any upfront payments, will grow faster than adjusted net sales in 2007. Adjusted net sales is defined as net sales plus an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales. Schering Plough believes that this growth comparison provides a useful guideline to review our outlook for R&D expenses. As a result of Schering Ploughs actions to streamline its manufacturing operations, Schering Plough expects annualized cost savings of approximately $100 million in 2007, and gross margin should improve accordingly. The risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors could cause actual results to differ from the expectations provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2008. The Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Statement codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The 46 Table of Contents standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Schering Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1N (SAB 108), Financial Statements Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which is effective for calendar year companies as of December 31, 2006. SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the financial statements are materially misstated. Under this guidance, companies should take into account both the effect of a misstatement on the current year balance sheet as well as the impact upon the current year income statement in assessing the materiality of a current year misstatement. Once a current year misstatement has been quantified, the guidance in SAB Topic 1M, Financial Statements Materiality, (SAB 99) should be applied to determine whether the misstatement is material. The implementation of SAB 108 did not have any impact on Schering Ploughs financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Schering Plough is required to apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning on January 1, 2007. The provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all existing uncertain income tax positions on the effective date. Upon the implementation of FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this Interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Although Schering Plough is still evaluating the potential impact of FIN 48, upon the adoption of FIN 48, it expects a decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 from $225 million to $300 million with a corresponding increase to other accrued liability accounts upon the adoption of this Interpretation. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and estimates are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect Schering Ploughs financial statements: Revenue Recognition Rebates, Discounts and Returns Provision for Income Taxes Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Accounting for Pensions and Post retirement Benefit Plans Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers, which include wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations. Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies, other indirect purchasers and other market participants such as managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers. Schering Plough recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs; and iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. 47 Table of Contents When recognizing revenue, Schering Plough estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, Schering Plough defers the recognition of revenue. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re evaluated as part of this process. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, Schering Plough would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed care organizations and government purchasers, and certain other market conditions. Rebates are estimated based on sales and contract terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Schering Plough evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition including expected generic introductions, or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. Schering Ploughs agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers address a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of these agreements, Schering Plough expects to avoid situations where Schering Ploughs shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Schering Ploughs rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Part D, at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $115 million and $144 million, respectively. Commercial discounts, returns and other rebate accruals in the U.S. at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $371 million and $378 million, respectively. These accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities, or in the case of returns and other receivable adjustments, an allowance provided against accounts receivable. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, Schering Ploughs payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy Schering Ploughs obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 19, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. 48 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 522 $ 537 Provision for Rebates 474 479 Adjustment to prior year estimates(1) (56 ) Payments (460 ) (495 ) (42 ) (16 ) Provision for Returns 124 116 Adjustment to prior year estimates (8 ) Returns (121 ) (167 ) (5 ) (51 ) Provision for Discounts 605 459 Adjustment to prior year estimates (6 ) Discounts granted (588 ) (407 ) 11 52 Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, End of Period $ 486 $ 522 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2006, the adjustment to prior year estimates for rebates includes $24 million resulting from the reversal of the accrued rebate amounts recorded in 2005 and 2004 for the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program that in August 2006, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals ruled pharmaceutical manufacturers are not obligated to pay. In formulating and recording the above accruals, management utilizes assumptions and estimates that include historical experience, wholesaler data, the projection of market conditions, the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate, utilization estimates, and forecasted product demand amounts as discussed under the critical accounting policy entitled Revenue Recognition. As part of its review of these accruals, management performs a sensitivity analysis that considers differing assumptions, which are most subject to judgment in its rebate accrual calculation. Based upon Schering Ploughs sensitivity analysis, reasonably possible changes to assumptions related to rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs could favorably or unfavorably impact net sales and income before taxes by approximately $20 million for 2006. Provision for Income Taxes As of December 31, 2006, taxes have not been provided on approximately $4.2 billion of earnings of international subsidiaries as Schering Plough considers these earnings indefinitely reinvested in its international subsidiaries. Schering Plough believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years, based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities. Schering Plough accrues liabilities for identified tax contingencies that result from tax positions taken that could be challenged by tax authorities. Schering Ploughs tax reserves reflect Schering Ploughs best estimate of the probable tax liability, however, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amount accrued. Schering Plough will adopt FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. See Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards as discussed above for additional 49 Table of Contents information regarding the expected impacts on Schering Ploughs financial statements from the implementation of FIN 48. Schering Ploughs potential tax exposures result from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property). Although Schering Ploughs cross border arrangements between affiliates are based upon internationally accepted standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country. Schering Plough records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Schering Plough has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event Schering Plough were to determine that it would be able to realize all or an additional portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should Schering Plough subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or an additional portion of its remaining net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $492 million at December 31, 2006. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $45 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2006. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Certain of Schering Ploughs manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the Consent Decree and other compliance activities. Schering Ploughs manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce Schering Ploughs manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments and or related costs. Accounting for Pension and Post retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. Schering Plough assesses its pension and other post retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, Schering Plough considers many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, Schering Ploughs historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations. See Note 7, Retirement Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. Discount rates used for pension and other post retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. 50 Table of Contents Actuarial assumptions are based upon managements best estimates and judgment. With other assumptions held constant, an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of $23 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost and an increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of $8 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. With other assumptions held constant, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $33 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost and a decreased of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $8 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. The expected rates of return for the pension and other post retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Schering Plough determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long term historical data as well as Schering Ploughs actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from Schering Ploughs expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market related value of assets ratably over a five year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering Ploughs U.S. pension plan is allocated 65 percent to equities; 28 percent to fixed income investments; and 7 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering Ploughs U.S. other post retirement benefit plans is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios equity weightings are consistent with the long term nature of the plans benefit obligations. For non U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. Effective December 31, 2006, Schering Plough accounts for its retirement and other post retirement benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158. Shareholders equity at December 31, 2006, was reduced by approximately 7 percent upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158. See Note 7, Retirement Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for additional information. SFAS No. 158 allows an extended adoption date for year end measurement date requirement as allowed under this Statement. Currently, a majority of Schering Ploughs retirement and other post retirement benefit plans assets and liabilities are measured at December 31. For the remaining plans, which have measurement dates other then year end, Schering Plough anticipates adopting the year end measurement date effective on December 31, 2007. Schering Plough does not expect any material impact on its financial statements upon the adoption. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. Schering Plough reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, Schering Plough may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of Schering Plough. Resolution of 51 Table of Contents any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Schering Ploughs results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE Schering Plough is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Schering Plough has subsidiaries in more than 50 countries. In 2006, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 60 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, Schering Ploughs reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because Schering Ploughs international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover can provide a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that Schering Ploughs international operations are widespread. In addition, at any point in time, Schering Ploughs international subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term, third party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect the translated value of these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, Schering Plough has used derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short term investments and the debt and equity securities held in non qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled more than $6 billion at December 31, 2006. For cash equivalents and short term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $25 million. For securities held in non qualified trusts, due to the long term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, Schering Ploughs exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short term borrowings. Schering Plough currently maintains an investment portfolio of short term investment instruments in excess of the amount of borrowings. Accordingly, Schering Plough has mitigated its exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. Schering Plough has long term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt by approximately $115 million. However, Schering Plough does not currently expect to refund this debt.
