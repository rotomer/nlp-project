Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of Schering Plough Schering Plough is an innovation driven science centered global health care company. Schering Plough discovers, develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals for three customer markets human prescription, animal health, and consumer. While most of the research and development activity is directed toward prescription products, there are important applications of this central research and development platform into the animal health products and the consumer health care products. Schering Plough also accesses external innovation via partnering, in licensing and acquisition for all three customer markets. Strategy Focused on Science Earlier this decade, Schering Plough experienced a number of business, regulatory, and legal challenges. In April 2003, the Board of Directors named Fred Hassan as the new Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering Plough Corporation. With support from the Board, he initiated a strategic plan, with the goal of stabilizing, repairing and turning around Schering Plough in order to build long term shareholder value. He also installed a new senior executive team. That strategic plan, the Action Agenda, is a six to eight year, five phase plan. Schering Plough is currently in the fourth phase of the Action Agenda Build the Base. During the Build the Base phase, Schering Plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front, and believes the Organon BioSciences N.V. (OBS) acquisition was a major, transformative accomplishment in this regard. The OBS acquisition added further diversification of marketed products, including two new therapeutic areas (Womens Health and Central Nervous System), as well as significant strength in Animal Health products and pipeline. Other accomplishments in 2007 include: growing the business, for example there was double digit sales growth in all three product groups, Human Pharmaceuticals, Animal Health and Consumer Health Care; penetrating new markets, including China, Brazil and Russia; expanding the product portfolio for Schering Ploughs three customer groups human pharmaceutical, animal health and consumer health care; and discovering and developing or acquiring new products. A key component of the Action Agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. As a result, a core strategy of Schering Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments that address important unmet medical needs and also have commercial value. Schering Plough has been successful in advancing its pipeline into several late stage projects that will require sizable resources to complete. Consistent with this core strategy, Schering Plough is increasing its investment in research and development. As Schering Plough continues to develop the later phase growth drivers of the pipeline (e.g., sugammadex, thrombin receptor antagonist, golimumab, vicriviroc, boceprevir and asenapine), it anticipates higher spending on clinical trial activities. Schering Ploughs progressing early pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas with more than 20 compounds now approaching or in Phase I development. As part of the Action Agenda, Schering Plough continues to work to enhance infrastructure, upgrade processes and systems and strengthen talent both the recruitment of talented individuals and the development of key employees. While these efforts are being implemented on a companywide basis, Schering Plough is focusing especially on research and development to support Schering Ploughs science based business. 31 Table of Contents Further, with the integration of the OBS employees into Schering Plough much new talent has been added. In addition, as part of the integration of OBS, Schering Plough has also announced that there will be some workforce reduction to eliminate redundancies. 2007 Results Highlights of Schering Ploughs performance in 2007 are as follows: Closed the acquisition of OBS on November 19, 2007 for a purchase price of approximately Euro 11 billion. Schering Ploughs net sales in 2007 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 20 percent, as compared to the 2006 period. 2007 net sales included $626 million of sales of products acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. Net loss available to common shareholders in 2007 was $1.6 billion, as compared to net income available to common shareholders of $1.1 billion in 2006. Included in the 2007 net loss is approximately $4.0 billion of charges related to purchase accounting for the OBS acquisition, including a $3.8 billion acquired in process research and development charge. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in 2007. Global sales of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, made by the cholesterol joint venture with Merck Company, Inc. (Merck) continued to grow in 2007 and contributed significantly to Schering Ploughs improved operating results and cash flow (see note below about 2008 developments). In addition, increased sales of pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX also contributed favorably to Schering Ploughs overall operating results and cash flow. The additional strength that Schering Plough developed, in 2007 and during the four years since Mr. Hassan and the new management team began the Action Agenda, is key for Schering Plough in the current environment. The pharmaceutical industry continues to be subject to ever more critical scrutiny, where events can be mischaracterized and drive amplified reactions. Schering Plough believes that new scientific data are best presented and discussed at appropriate scientific and medical forums. Early 2008 Developments Relating to the Cholesterol Franchise As explained in more detail in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, ENHANCE Matter, in early 2008, Schering Plough encountered such a challenge when results of a Merck/Schering Plough cholesterol joint venture clinical trial, called ENHANCE, and joint venture products ZETIA and VYTORIN, became the subject of much media scrutiny prior to fuller discussions of the trial results at appropriate medical forums. A discussion is scheduled for the American College of Cardiology meeting on March 30, 2008. Medical experts and health advisory groups have long recognized high LDL cholesterol (often known as bad cholesterol) as a significant cardiovascular risk factor and recommended increasingly aggressive treatment of high cholesterol for certain patients. Lowering LDL cholesterol, along with a healthy diet and lifestyle changes, remains the cornerstone of lipid treatment for patients at risk for heart disease. Clinical studies, including ENHANCE, have demonstrated that VYTORIN lowers patients LDL cholesterol more than rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin at the doses studied and was able to get more patients to their LDL cholesterol goals (as defined by ATP III). While it is too early to tell the impact of the joint ventures ENHANCE trial results on the joint ventures cholesterol business, Schering Ploughs diversified group of products and geographic areas, as well as its highly experienced executive team, gives Schering Plough additional strength that will be helpful in weathering this situation. Strategic Alliances As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Schering Plough licenses manufacturing, marketing and or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and or distributes products 32 Table of Contents owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of Schering Plough that may create positive or negative impacts on Schering Plough. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to Schering Ploughs current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(r) to Schering Ploughs 10 K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(v) to Schering Ploughs 10 K. Cholesterol Franchise Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are managed through a joint venture between Schering Plough and Merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels in all markets outside of Japan. ZETIA is Schering Ploughs novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor (simvastatin), a statin medication developed by Merck. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck, and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. The cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market, and on a combined basis, these products continued to grow in terms of sales and market share during 2007 (see note above about 2008 developments). A material change in the sales or market share of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise would have a significant impact on Schering Ploughs consolidated results of operations and cash flows. In order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business, Schering Plough must continue to increase profits. This increased profitability is largely dependent upon the performance of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise. Japan is not included in the joint venture with Merck. In the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare is co marketing Schering Ploughs cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, which was approved in Japan in April 2007 as a monotherapy and co administered with a statin for use in patients with hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous sitosterolemia. ZETIA was launched in Japan during June 2007. Schering Ploughs sales of ZETIA in Japan under the co marketing agreement with Bayer Healthcare are recognized in net sales. License Arrangements with Centocor REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. REMICADE is Schering Ploughs second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). REMICADE is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson Johnson company. During 2005, Schering Plough exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody currently in Phase III trials. Schering Plough has exclusive marketing rights to both products outside of the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. In December 2007, Schering Plough and Centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development, commercialization and distribution of both REMICADE and golimumab, extending Schering Ploughs rights to exclusively market REMICADE to match the duration of Schering Ploughs exclusive marketing rights for golimumab. Effective upon regulatory approval of golimumab in the EU, Schering Ploughs marketing rights for both products will now extend for 15 years after the first commercial sale of golimumab within the EU. Centocor will receive a progressively increased share of profits on Schering Ploughs distribution of both products in the Schering Plough marketing territory between 2010 and 2014, and the share of profits will remain fixed thereafter for the remainder of the term. The changes to the duration of REMICADE marketing rights and the profit sharing arrangement for the products are all conditioned on approval of golimumab being granted prior to September 1, 2014. Schering Plough may independently develop 33 Table of Contents and market golimumab for a Crohns disease indication in its territories, with an option for Centocor to participate. In addition, Schering Plough and Centocor agreed to utilize an autoinjector device in the commercialization of golimumab and further agreed to share its development costs. For the rights to this device, Schering Plough made an upfront payment of $21 million, which is included in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007. Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Schering Plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. Schering Plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the drug development process (where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets), information technology systems, and post marketing studies and monitoring. Schering Plough continually reviews the business, including manufacturing operations, to identify actions that will enhance long term competitiveness. However, Schering Ploughs manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed, and actions to significantly reduce Schering Ploughs manufacturing infrastructure, including OBS manufacturing operations acquired during 2007, involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. From time to time, actions are taken to enhance Schering Ploughs overall manufacturing efficiency. For example, during 2006, Schering Plough closed a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico and in 2007 began the process of closing a small manufacturing facility in the Asia Pacific region. Schering Plough continues to review the carrying value of manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments or related costs. Regulatory and Competitive Environment Schering Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. Regulatory compliance is complex and costly, impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Schering Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. Research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., the EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Schering Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. Clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. A number of intermediaries are involved between drug manufacturers, such as Schering Plough, and patients who use the drugs. These intermediaries impact the patients ability, and their precriberss ability, to choose and pay for a particular drug. These intermediaries include health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics; payors and their representatives, such as employers, insurers, managed care organizations and governments; and others in the supply chain, such as pharmacists and wholesalers. Further, in the U.S., many of Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as certain of the intermediaries (including managed care groups, institutions and government agencies) seek price discounts. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Also, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering Ploughs operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering Ploughs products mature. 34 Table of Contents OBS Acquisition On November 19, 2007, Schering Plough acquired OBS for a purchase price of approximately Euro 11 billion in cash, or approximately $16.1 billion. Commencing from the acquisition date, OBS assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the results of OBS operations, are included in Schering Ploughs consolidated financial statements. There were approximately one and one half months of results of operations relating to OBS included in Schering Ploughs Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The impact of purchase accounting, based on a preliminary valuation, resulted in the following non cash charges in 2007: Acquired In Process Research and Development (IPRD), which was a one time charge of approximately $3.8 billion. Amortization of inventory adjusted to fair value, of which approximately $1.1 billion will be charged to Cost of Sales ($258 million in 2007) approximately over a one year period from the acquisition date. Amortization of acquired intangible assets adjusted to fair value, of which $6.8 billion will be amortized over a weighted average life of 15 years to Cost of Sales ($65 million in 2007). Incremental depreciation relating to the adjustment in fair value on property, plant and equipment of $885 million that will be depreciated primarily to Cost of Sales over the lives of the applicable property ($3 million in 2007). The $3.8 billion acquired IPRD charge was associated with research projects in the womens health, central nervous system and anesthesia therapeutic areas of human health as well as research projects in animal health. The amount was determined by using discounted cash flow projections of identified research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use. The discount rates used ranged from 14 percent to 18 percent. The projected launch dates following FDA or other regulatory approval are years 2008 through 2013, at which time Schering Plough expects these projects to begin to generate cash flows. All of the research and development projects considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS The results of operations in 2007 discussed below include OBS product sales and expenses as well as certain non cash charges relating to purchase accounting associated with the OBS acquisition. Net Sales A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler, retail and trade buying decisions, changes in overall demand factors or other factors. In addition to these fluctuations, sales of many pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups, institutions, government agencies, and other groups seeking discounts. Schering Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the U.S. market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the Medicaid program, the veterans health care program, and other government funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. This prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006 and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost containment 35 Table of Contents programs, placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. Consolidated net sales in 2007 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 20 percent as compared to 2006. Consolidated net sales in 2007 included $626 million of OBS net sales related to the period subsequent to the acquisition. The increase also reflects the growth in sale volumes of REMICADE, TEMODAR, NASONEX and AVELOX as well as contributions from Animal Health and Consumer Health Care and a favorable impact of 4 percent from foreign exchange. Consolidated net sales in 2006 were $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 11 percent compared to 2005. The increase primarily reflected the growth in sale volumes of REMICADE, NASONEX, PEGINTRON and TEMODAR. This increase also reflected an unfavorable impact of 1 percent from foreign exchange. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 (Dollars in millions) HUMAN PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 10,173 $ 8,561 $ 7,564 19 % 13 % REMICADE 1,648 1,240 942 33 32 NASONEX 1,092 944 737 16 28 PEGINTRON 911 837 751 9 11 TEMODAR 861 703 588 22 20 CLARINEX/AERIUS 799 722 646 11 12 CLARITIN Rx 391 356 371 10 (4 ) AVELOX 384 304 228 26 34 INTEGRILIN 332 329 315 1 5 REBETOL 277 311 331 (11 ) (6 ) CAELYX 257 206 181 25 13 INTRON A 233 237 287 (2 ) (17 ) SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE 220 203 197 8 3 ASMANEX 162 103 11 57 N/M Other Pharmaceutical 2,606 2,066 1,979 26 44 ANIMAL HEALTH 1,251 910 851 37 7 CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,266 1,123 1,093 13 3 OTC 682 558 556 22 N/M Foot Care 345 343 333 1 3 Sun Care 239 222 204 8 9 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 12,690 $ 10,594 $ 9,508 20 % 11 % N/M Not a meaningful percentage. Sales of Human Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2007 totaled $10.2 billion, a $1.6 billion or 19% increase compared to 2006. Included in 2007 are $409 million of net sales related to Organon, the human health business of OBS. Sales of Human Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2006 totaled $8.6 billion, a $1.0 billion or 13% increase compared to 2005. International net sales of REMICADE, a drug for the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis, were up 33 percent to $1.6 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006 driven by continued market growth, expanded use across indications and a favorable impact from foreign 36 Table of Contents exchange. Global net sales increased 32 percent in 2006 to $1.2 billion as compared to 2005, due to greater demand, expanded indications and continued market growth. Competitive products for the indications referred to above have been introduced during 2006 and 2007. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 16 percent to $1.1 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased sales across all geographic regions, and 28 percent to $944 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share in 2006. Competitive products have been introduced in 2007. Global net sales of PEGINTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, increased 9 percent to $911 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to higher sales in Latin America and emerging markets across Europe, and tempered by lower sales in Japan due to increased competition and a decrease in the U.S. market size. Global net sales increased 11 percent to $837 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 reflecting higher sales volume in Japan and the U.S. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from a significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEGINTRON before beginning treatment. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 22 percent to $861 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased sales across geographic markets, including Japan, where the product was launched in September 2006. Global net sales increased 20 percent to $703 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the increased utilization for new indications. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year round indoor allergies, in 2007 increased 11 percent to $799 million as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales in international markets. Global net sales in 2006 increased 12 percent to $722 million as compared to 2005 due to increased demand in Europe and Latin America as well as increased sales in the U.S. despite slightly declining market share. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN increased 10 percent to $391 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 reflecting growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. Sales in 2006 decreased 4 percent to $356 million as compared to 2005. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, increased 26 percent to $384 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of increased market share. Net sales in 2006 increased 34 percent to $304 million in 2006 as compared to $228 million in 2005 due to share growth and new indications. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough, increased 1 percent to $332 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. During 2006, sales increased 5 percent to $329 million as compared to 2005. Global 2007 net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with PEGINTRON or INTRON A for treating hepatitis C, decreased 11 percent to $277 million as compared to 2006 due to lower patient enrollment in Japan and increased generic competition. Global net sales in 2006 decreased 6 percent to $311 million as compared to 2005 due to lower sales in Europe and increased competition. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEGINTRON before beginning hepatitis C treatment. International net sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposis sarcoma, increased 25 percent to $257 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales in Latin America and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales in 2006 increased 13 percent to $206 million as compared to 2005 primarily due to an expanding market for this product. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 2 percent to $233 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, and 17 percent in 2006 to 37 Table of Contents $237 million as compared to 2005. The decrease in both 2007 and 2006 were due to the conversion to PEGINTRON for treating hepatitis C in Japan. International net sales of SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 8 percent to $220 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of a benefit from foreign exchange. Sales increased 3 percent to $203 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to increased market share. In October 2006, SUBOXONE was approved by the EU, including the 25 member states as well as Iceland and Norway, for the treatment of opioid dependence. Global net sales of ASMANEX, an orally inhaled steroid for asthma, were up 57 percent to $162 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to market share growth in the U.S. Sales increased to $103 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the ASMANEX launch commencing in late 2005. Other pharmaceutical net sales include all net sales of Organon from the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2007 and a large number of lower sales volume human prescription pharmaceutical products. Net sales of Organon were $409 million in 2007 and included $57 million for FOLLISTIM/PUREGON, a fertility treatment, and $45 million for NUVARING, a contraception product. Also included in other pharmaceutical sales are several lower volume products which are often sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. These products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Included in other pharmaceutical sales is sales of Schering Ploughs albuterol products. In 2005, the FDA issued a Final Rule that requires all CFC albuterol products, including Schering Ploughs PROVENTIL CFC, be removed from the market no later than December 31, 2008. Schering Ploughs transition to albuterol HFA (PROVENTIL HFA) is complete. Schering Plough no longer manufactures the CFC product and all remaining CFC inventories have been sold during 2007. Schering Plough is uncertain as to the ultimate impact on Schering Ploughs overall future sales of PROVENTIL HFA, due to the complexities and multiple external factors influencing this transition, including competing albuterol HFA products. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 37 percent to $1.3 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006. Included in global Animal Health net sales are $217 million related to Intervet, the animal health business of OBS, for the period subsequent to the acquisition. Global net sales in 2007 also benefited from solid growth in all geographic areas, led by the cattle and companion animal product lines, coupled with a positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Global net sales increased 7 percent in 2006 to $910 million as compared to 2005, reflecting strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas led by higher sales of companion animal products. The Animal Health segments sales growth rate is impacted by intense competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased 13 percent or $143 million as compared to 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to the sales of MiraLAX, which was launched in February 2007 as the first Rx to OTC switch in the laxative category in more than 30 years, and higher sales of OTC CLARITIN. Global net sales in 2006 increased 3 percent or $30 million as compared to 2005 reflecting an increase in sales of sun care products and DR. SCHOLLS and other foot care products. Sales of OTC CLARITIN increased 18 percent to $462 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to sales growth across all product forms. OTC CLARITIN sales decreased 1 percent in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of the restrictions on the retail sale of OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (PSE). In addition, OTC CLARITIN continues to face competition from private labels and branded loratadine, and a competing prescription antihistamine was launched for OTC sale in early 2008. Net sales of sun care products increased $17 million or 8 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY line extensions, and $18 million or 9 percent in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to the success of new COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products launched in 2005. Future sales in the Consumer Health Care segment are difficult to predict because the consumer health care market is highly competitive, with heavy advertising to consumers and frequent competitive product introductions. 38 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin 65.3 % 65.1 % 64.8 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Selling, general and administrative (SGA) $ 5,468 $ 4,718 $ 4,374 15.9 % 7.9 % Research and development (RD) 2,926 2,188 1,865 33.7 % 17.3 % Acquired in process research and development (IPRD) 3,754 N/M N/M Other (income)/expense, net (683 ) (135 ) 5 N/M N/M Special and acquisition related charges 84 102 294 N/M N/M Equity income (2,049 ) (1,459 ) (873 ) 40.4 % N/M N/M Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in Schering Ploughs net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, Schering Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in Schering Ploughs Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, Schering Ploughs gross margin, and ratios of SGA expenses and RD expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the joint ventures operating results. Gross margin Gross margin was 65.3 percent in 2007 as compared to 65.1 percent in 2006. Gross margin in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by $326 million of purchase accounting adjustments included in cost of sales. These purchase accounting adjustments were a result of the amortization of fair values of certain assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. Gross margin in 2007, when compared to 2006, benefited from realized cost savings of approximately $100 million from manufacturing streamlining in 2006, the non recurrence of $146 million of charges associated with the aforementioned manufacturing streamlining actions and favorable product mix. Despite negative impacts on cost of sales from the costs resulting from Schering Ploughs actions to streamline its manufacturing operations during 2006, gross margin increased to 65.1 percent in 2006 from 64.8 percent in 2005. This improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and process improvements within Schering Ploughs supply chain, including cost savings from the manufacturing streamlining activities completed during 2006. In 2006, cost of sales included charges totaling $146 million associated with Schering Ploughs actions to streamline its manufacturing operations, offset by savings of approximately $30 million as a result of these actions. See Note 3, Special and Acquisition Related Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for additional information. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) increased 16 percent to $5.5 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006. Included in SGA in 2007 were $227 million from OBS. In addition, the increase in SGA reflects higher promotion spending, ongoing investments in emerging markets and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. SGA increased 8 percent to $4.7 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, reflecting ongoing investments in emerging markets and field support for product launches as well as higher promotional spending. 39 Table of Contents Research and development Research and development (RD) spending increased 34 percent to $2.9 billion in 2007 as compared to the 2006 period. Included in RD in 2007 were $111 million from OBS. Also included in RD were upfront payments of $197 million mainly related to certain licensing transactions. The increase in RD spending versus 2006 also reflects higher spending for clinical trials and related activities and investments to build greater breadth and capacity to support the continued expansion of Schering Ploughs pipeline. In 2006, RD spending increased 17 percent to $2.2 billion as compared to the 2005 period. The 2006 increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical trials as well as building greater breadth and capacity to support Schering Ploughs progressing pipeline. Generally, changes in RD spending reflect the timing of Schering Ploughs funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. To maximize Schering Ploughs chances for the successful development of new products, Schering Plough began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high priority programs within RD. In 2006, Schering Plough began a Global Clinical Harmonization Program to maximize and globalize the quality of clinical trial execution, pharmacovigilance and regulatory processes. In 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program have been implemented. Acquired in process research and development The acquired in process research and development charge of $3.8 billion in 2007 was a result of the OBS acquisition and represents the immediate expense recognition of the fair value of acquired research projects for which technological feasibility has not been established and for which there is no alternative future use. Other (income)/expense, net Schering Plough had other income, net, of $683 million in 2007 compared to $135 million of other income, net, in 2006 and other expense, net, of $5 million in 2005. Other income, net, in 2007 included net realized gains on foreign currency options of $510 million related to the OBS acquisition. The increase in other income, net, in 2007 also reflected higher interest income due to higher balances of cash equivalents and short term investments partially offset by higher interest expense due to the issuance of new debt. Special and acquisition related charges and manufacturing streamlining 2007 special and acquisition related charges During the year ended December 31, 2007, Schering Plough incurred $84 million of special and acquisition related charges, comprised of $61 million of integration related costs for the OBS acquisition and $23 million of severance charges as part of integration activities. 2006 manufacturing streamlining During 2006, Schering Plough implemented changes to its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and New Jersey that have streamlined its global supply chain and further enhanced Schering Ploughs long term competitiveness. These changes resulted in the phase out and closure of Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations in Manati, Puerto Rico, and additional workforce reductions in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and New Jersey. In total, these actions resulted in the elimination of over 1,000 positions. Schering Plough expects these actions to yield an annualized cost savings of approximately $100 million. Special charges: Special charges in 2006 related to the changes in Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations totaled $102 million. These charges consisted of approximately $47 million of severance and $55 million of fixed asset impairments. Cost of Sales: Included in 2006 cost of sales was approximately $146 million consisting of $93 million of accelerated depreciation, $46 million of inventory write offs, and $7 million of other charges related to the closure of Schering Ploughs manufacturing facilities in Manati, Puerto Rico. 40 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activities reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to changes to Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations which were completed in 2006: Charges included in Special Total Cash Non cash Accrued Cost of sales charges charges payments charges Liability (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at January 1, 2006 $ Severance $ $ 47 $ 47 $ (35 ) $ 12 Asset impairments 55 55 (55 ) Accelerated depreciation 93 93 (93 ) Inventory write offs 46 46 (46 ) Other 7 7 (2 ) (5 ) Total $ 146 $ 102 $ 248 $ (37 ) $ (199 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2006 $ 12 Severance (12 ) (12 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2007 $ 2005 special charge activities Special charges incurred in 2005 are as follows: 2005 (Dollars in Millions) Litigation charges $ 250 Employee termination costs 28 Asset impairment and other charges 16 $ 294 Litigation Charges: In 2005, litigation reserves were increased by $250 million. This increase resulted in a total reserve of $500 million for the Massachusetts Investigation, as well as the investigations and the state litigation disclosed under AWP Litigation and Investigations in Note 20, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, representing Schering Ploughs then current estimate to resolve this matter. On August 29, 2006, Schering Plough announced it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the Massachusetts Investigation for an aggregate amount of $435 million plus interest. This settlement amount relates only to the Massachusetts Investigation. The AWP investigations and litigation are ongoing. During 2007, Schering Plough made payments totaling $435 million related to this settlement. Employee termination costs: Employee termination costs in 2005 consisted of $7 million associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. during 2003 and $21 million of other employee termination costs. Asset impairment and other charges: For the year ended December 31, 2005, Schering Plough recognized asset impairment and other charges of $16 million related primarily to the consolidation of Schering Ploughs U.S. biotechnology organizations. Equity income Sales of the Merck/Schering Plough cholesterol joint venture totaled $5.2 billion, $3.9 billion, and $2.4 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The sales growth in 2007 was due primarily to higher market share and market growth in the U.S. and continued expansion into international markets. The sales growth in 2006 was due primarily to an increase in market share. 41 Table of Contents The companies bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the cholesterol agreements provide for a reimbursement to each company for physician details that are set on annual basis, and in Italy, a contractual amount is included in the profit sharing calculation that is not reimbursed. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, this amount is equal to each companys physician details multiplied by a contractual fixed fee. Schering Plough reports these amounts as part of equity income. These amounts do not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs for Schering Ploughs detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, these amounts are not reflective of Schering Ploughs sales effort related to the joint venture, as Schering Ploughs sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the companies contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct to consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out of pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by Schering Plough and Merck. Under certain conditions, as specified in the joint venture agreements with Merck, Schering Plough could be entitled to receive reimbursements of its future research and development expenses of up to $105 million. Additional information regarding the joint venture with Merck is also included in Note 4, Equity Income, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Equity income from the Merck/Schering Plough joint venture totaled $2.0 billion, $1.5 billion, and $873 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 equity income as compared to 2006 reflected higher market share in the U.S. and international sales growth. The increase in 2006 equity income as compared to 2005 reflected continued strong sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA. During 2005, Schering Plough recognized milestones from Merck of $20 million related to certain European approvals of VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in 2005. It should be noted that Schering Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income and instead are included in the overall cost structure of Schering Plough. Provision for income taxes Tax expense was $258 million, $362 million, and $228 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The 2007 tax provision included tax benefits of $89 million related to the amortization of fair values of certain assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. The 2006 income tax provision primarily relates to foreign taxes. The 2005 tax provision includes a benefit of $46 million related to an IRS Notice issued in August 2005, which resulted in a reduction of the previously accrued tax liability attributable to repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The tax provisions in 2007, 2006 and 2005 do not include any benefit related to U.S. operating losses. During 2004, Schering Plough established a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. operating losses, as management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. At December 31, 2007, Schering Plough continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Schering Plough expects to report a U.S. Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of $1.7 billion on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2007. This U.S. NOL carryforward could be materially reduced after examination of Schering Ploughs income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2007, Schering Plough generated approximately $980 million in U.S. losses including the impact of purchase accounting, however, due to differences between financial and tax reporting, Schering Plough expects to report a minimal increase in its NOL on its 2007 U.S. tax return. Schering Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the Interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering Ploughs retained earnings 42 Table of Contents balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering Plough reduced its January 1, 2007 retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering Ploughs unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering Ploughs tax matters litigation (see Note 20, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for additional information). At January 1, and December 31, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $924 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance, potential refund claims and tax liabilities. At January 1, and December 31, 2007, approximately $645 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the next twelve month period by up to $615 million. This decrease would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court, possible final resolution of Schering Ploughs 1997 2002 examination at IRS Appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering Ploughs tax matters and the payment and or receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering Ploughs control. Schering Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of accrued interest related to tax positions at January 1, and December 31, 2007 was $193 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. During the second quarter of 2007, the IRS completed its examination of Schering Ploughs 1997 2002 federal income tax returns. Schering Plough is seeking resolution of an issue raised during this examination through the IRS administrative appeals process. Schering Plough remains open with the IRS for the 1997 2007 tax years. For most of its other significant tax jurisdictions (both U.S. state and foreign), Schering Ploughs income tax returns are open for examination for the period 2000 through 2007. Net (loss)/income available to common shareholders Schering Plough had a net (loss)/income available to common shareholders of $(1.6) billion, $1.1 billion and $183 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net loss available to common shareholders for 2007 included approximately $4.0 billion of charges related to purchase accounting for the OBS acquisition, including a $3.8 billion acquired in process research and development charge. Net loss available to common shareholders for 2007 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $118 million related to the 2004 and 2007 Preferred Stock. Net income available to common shareholders for 2006 and 2005 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $86 million, in each period, related to the 2004 Preferred Stock. Net (loss)/income available to common shareholders for 2007, 2006, and 2005 also included special and acquisition related charges and manufacturing streamlining costs of approximately $84 million, $248 million, and $294 million, respectively. See Note 3, Special and Acquisition Related Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow from operating activities $ 2,630 $ 2,161 $ 882 Cash flow from investing activities (13,156 ) (2,908 ) (454 ) Cash flow from financing activities 10,089 (1,361 ) (633 ) 43 Table of Contents Operating Activities In 2007, operating activities provided $2.6 billion of cash, compared with net cash provided by operations of $2.2 billion in 2006. The increase was primarily due to a net realized gain of $510 million from foreign currency options relating to the OBS acquisition, higher net sales and equity income, partially offset by payments of $435 million for the settlement of the Massachusetts Investigation and $98 million for tax and interest due in connection with an examination by the IRS of Schering Ploughs 1997 2002 federal income tax returns. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering Plough purchased euro denominated currency options (derivatives) for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives were short term (trading) in nature and did not hedge a specific financing or investment transaction. Accordingly, the cash impacts of these derivatives have been classified as operating cash flows in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion as compared to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher net income and the timing of operating cash payments and receipts. In 2005, operating activities generated $882 million of cash including payments of approximately $375 million to tax authorities for tax liabilities related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA; and tax payments of $239 million related to the settlement of certain tax contingencies for the tax years 1993 through 1996. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during 2007 was $13.2 billion, primarily consisting of $15.8 billion of net cash used to purchase OBS. In addition, source of cash for investing activities included a net reduction of short term investments of $3.3 billion partially offset by $618 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2006 was $2.9 billion primarily related to the net purchases of short term investments of $2.4 billion previously invested in cash equivalents and $458 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2005 was $454 million, primarily related to $478 million of capital expenditures and the purchase of intangible assets of $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $43 million and the net reduction in short term investments of $33 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $10.1 billion for 2007, compared to cash used of $1.4 billion for the same period in 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 included net proceeds on the issuance of common and mandatory convertible preferred shares of approximately $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, and net proceeds of approximately $6.4 billion on the issuance of long term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities also included $225 million of proceeds from stock option exercises offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $481 million. Net cash used for financing activities during 2006 and 2005 was $1.4 billion and $633 million, respectively. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2006 and 2005 include the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $412 million and $410 million, respectively; the repayment of $1.0 billion of bank debt and short term commercial paper borrowings in 2006; and $1.2 billion of short term commercial paper borrowings in 2005. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2005 was partially offset by proceeds of $900 million from bank debt incurred by a foreign subsidiary related to funding of a portion of the repatriations under the AJCA during 2005. This bank debt was fully repaid in 2006. 44 Table of Contents Other Discussion of Cash Flows Schering Plough is moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business and currently is in the process of building a U.S. pharmaceutical sciences center in New Jersey. Capital expenditures of approximately $50 million and $40 million were made in 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to this center. Additional capital expenditures of approximately $175 million are expected over the next two years. This center will allow Schering Plough to streamline and integrate its drug development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to market. There will be additional related expenditures to upgrade equipment and staffing for this center. At December 31, 2007, Schering Plough had net debt (total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable securities) of $7.1 billion. Cash generated from operations, available cash and short term investments and available credit facilities are expected to provide Schering Plough with the ability to fund cash needs for the intermediate term. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On September 17, 2007, Schering Plough issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes due 2037. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.0 billion. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually. The effective interest rate on the 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes and the 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes, which incorporates the initial discount and debt issuance fees, is 6.13 percent and 6.67 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering Ploughs option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100 percent of the principal amount of such notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the rate of Treasury Notes with comparable remaining terms plus 25 basis points for the 2017 notes or 30 basis points for the 2037 notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. On October 1, 2007, Schering Plough issued Euro 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes due 2010 and Euro 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes due 2014. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.8 billion. Interest on the notes is payable annually. The effective interest rate on the 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes and the 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes, which incorporates the initial discount, debt issuance fees and the impact of interest rate hedges, is 5.10 percent and 5.46 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering Ploughs option at any time, at a redemption price specified in the prospectus. If a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Schering Plough used the net proceeds from these notes to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. On October 24, 2007, Schering Plough entered into a five year senior unsecured euro denominated term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. On October 31, 2007, Schering Plough drew Euro 1.1 billion ($1.6 billion) on this term loan to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. This new term 45 Table of Contents loan has a floating interest rate and requires Schering Plough to maintain a net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the term loan. The term loan also generally restricts Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. The reported U.S. dollar amounts of the outstanding debt balance and interest expense on the euro denominated notes and euro denominated term loan will fluctuate due to the impact of foreign currency translation. On November 26, 2003, Schering Plough issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment and, in connection with ratings downgrades in 2004, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. The interest rate payable on a particular series of notes will return to 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, and the rate adjustment provisions will permanently cease to apply if, the notes are subsequently rated above Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by SP. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moodys or SP is downgraded below A3 or A , respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 14, Borrowings and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. On August 9, 2007, Schering Plough entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and terminated its $1.5 billion credit facility that was due to mature in May 2009. This credit facility has a floating interest rate, matures in August 2012 and requires Schering Plough to maintain a net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the credit facility. The credit facility also generally restricts Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered as support to Schering Ploughs commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances, however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. As of December 31, 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, short term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $451 million and $242 million, respectively, including outstanding commercial paper of $149 million as of both dates. The weighted average interest rate for short term borrowings at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 7.9 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. Schering Ploughs senior unsecured euro denominated notes and euro denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (SFAS 52), the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. 46 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Schering Ploughs current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Long Term Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long term Short term Review Status Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Stable Standard and Poors A A 2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB+ F 2 Stable The short term ratings discussed above have not significantly affected Schering Ploughs ability to issue or rollover its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, Schering Plough believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as Schering Plough, with one or more short term credit ratings of P 2 from Moodys, A 2 from SP and or F 2 from Fitch to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers is typically less than that of higher rated companies. Schering Ploughs sizable lines of credit with commercial banks as well as cash and short term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Schering Ploughs credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on a portion of Schering Ploughs short and long term debt. As discussed above, Schering Plough believes that existing cash and short term investments, available credit facilities and cash generated from operations will allow Schering Plough to fund its cash needs for the intermediate term. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On August 15, 2007, Schering Plough issued 10,000,000 shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the 2007 Preferred Stock) with a face value of $2.5 billion. Net proceeds to Schering Plough were approximately $2.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2007 Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. Each share of the 2007 Preferred Stock will automatically convert into between 7.4206 and 9.0909 common shares of Schering Plough depending on the average closing price of Schering Ploughs common shares over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the mandatory conversion date of August 13, 2010, as defined in the prospectus. The preferred shareholders may elect to convert at any time prior to August 13, 2010, at the minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares per share of the 2007 Preferred Stock. Additionally, if at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date the closing price of Schering Ploughs common shares exceeds $50.53 (for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days), Schering Plough may elect to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of the 2007 Preferred Stock then outstanding at the same minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares for each share of 2007 Preferred Stock. The 2007 Preferred Stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of 6 percent on shares outstanding. The dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and, to the extent Schering Plough is legally permitted to pay dividends and the Board of Directors declares a dividend payable, Schering Plough will pay dividends on each dividend payment date. The dividend payment dates are February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, with the first dividend to be paid on November 15, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, all shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued on August 10, 2004 (the 2004 Preferred Stock) were converted into 64,584,929 shares of Schering Plough common stock. 47 Table of Contents Equity Issuance and Treasury Shares On August 15, 2007, Schering Plough issued 57,500,000 common shares from treasury shares at $27.50 per share. Net proceeds to Schering Plough were approximately $1.5 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the common shares to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. See Note 2, Acquisition, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Schering Plough has various contractual obligations that are reported as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and others that are not required to be recognized as liabilities such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts. The following table summarizes payments due by period under Schering Ploughs known contractual obligations at December 31, 2007. Payments Due by Period Less More than than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt $ 461 $ 461 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations(1) 9,019 752 1,657 6,610 Operating lease obligations 907 338 330 168 71 Purchase obligations(2) 2,976 2,736 214 21 5 Deferred compensation plan obligations 192 50 23 63 56 Other obligations(3) 765 363 262 22 118 Total $ 14,320 $ 3,948 $ 1,581 $ 1,931 $ 6,860 (1) Long term debt obligations include the aggregate principal amount of all long term debt and excludes interest obligations.

(2) Purchase obligations include advertising and research contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other inventory and expense items, and unless material research milestone payments are likely to be paid do not include potential milestone payments since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by Schering Plough without penalty. Other purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non cancelable items. (3) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of Schering Ploughs pension plans, preferred stock dividends, managements estimate of the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SCHERING PLOUGH OPERATES Schering Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. These regulations are described in more detail in Part I, Item I, Business, of this 10 K. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is also costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. 48 Table of Contents Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Much is still unknown about the science of human health and with every drug there are benefits and risks. Societal and government pressures are constantly shifting between the demand for innovation to meet urgent unmet medical needs and adversity to risk. These pressures impact the regulatory environment and the market for Schering Ploughs products. Regulatory Compliance and Pharmacovigilance Consent Decree On August 2, 2007, Schering Plough announced the dissolution of the Consent Decree by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. See Note 19, Consent Decree, under Item 1, Financial Statements. Regulatory Inspections Schering Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug, in order to alert the drugs manufacturer and the governmental agency to potential problems. During 2003, pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) cited serious deficiencies in reporting processes. Schering Plough has continued to work on its long term action plan to rectify the deficiencies and has provided regular updates to the EMEA. During the fourth quarter 2005, local UK and EMEA regulatory authorities conducted a follow up inspection to assess Schering Ploughs implementation of its action plan. In the first quarter of 2006, these authorities also inspected the U.S. based components of Schering Ploughs pharmacovigilance system. The inspectors acknowledged that progress had been made since 2003, but also continued to note significant concerns with the quality systems supporting Schering Ploughs pharmacovigilance processes. Similarly, in a follow up inspection of Schering Ploughs clinical trial practices in the UK, inspectors identified issues with respect to Schering Ploughs management of clinical trials and related pharmacovigilance practices. In February 2006, Schering Plough began the Global Clinical Harmonization Program for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which will strengthen Schering Ploughs scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. In 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program were implemented and work is expected to continue in 2008 and for several years. In addition, during the fourth quarter 2007, the local UK regulatory authority conducted a follow up inspection which confirmed that the corrective actions committed to by Schering Plough following the 2006 inspection of Schering Ploughs UK based clinical trial operations had in fact been completed. In early January 2008, the local UK regulatory authority returned for a follow up inspection of Schering Ploughs UK pharmacovigilance operations. This inspection likewise confirmed that a number of corrective actions had been completed since the last inspection and noted the number of actions Schering Plough had taken as set forth in Schering Ploughs periodic updates to the EMEA and noted a limited number of observations which Schering Plough is addressing. Schering Plough intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. Schering Plough remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Schering Plough does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to the inspections. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against Schering Plough and or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering Ploughs products. 49 Table of Contents Regulatory Compliance and Post Marketing Surveillance Schering Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. These clinical trial research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., EU and local country regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with current Good Clinical Practices or other applicable laws or regulations can result in delays in approval of clinical trials, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, delays in approval of marketing authorizations, criminal sanctions against Schering Plough and or responsible individuals, and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering Ploughs products. Clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. For the past several years, these occurrences have increased. Recently media mischaracterization of early topline results from the ENHANCE clinical trail led to some concerns among patients and prescribers about ZETIA and VYTORIN (see discussion under Early 2008 Developments in the Executive Summary of this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Schering Ploughs personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Following this wave of recent product withdrawals by other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA have continued to increase their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re reviewing select products which are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and in particular direct to consumer advertising. Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA in Japan, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products and has added to the uncertainty in predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog and has made some progress over the last year, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect Schering Ploughs operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. Schering Plough has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, NOXAFIL, CLARINEX D 24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D 12, SUBOXONE and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the U.S., PEGINTRON, ZETIA, TEMODAR and ESMERON/ESLAX in Japan, and new indications for REMICADE. Schering Plough also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval. Pricing Pressures As described more specifically in Note 20, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 1, Financial Statements, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business 50 Table of Contents practices of Schering Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject Schering Plough to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Schering Plough also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In the U.S. market, Schering Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. This prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006 and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements; emphasized greater use of generic drugs; and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since Schering Plough is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. Competition The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering Ploughs operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering Ploughs products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2008 OUTLOOK Schering Plough does not provide numeric guidance. However, the following outlook may be helpful to readers in assessing future prospects: See the earlier discussion of matters relating to the Merck/Schering Plough cholesterol joint ventures ENHANCE clinical trial. IMS prescription data (U.S.) shows that, to date in 2008, prescriptions for VYTORIN and ZETIA have declined. Although the prescription data has shown some early signs of stabilization, there are limitations to this prescription data and it is too early to discern any trends from this data. It is likely that there will be weekly fluctuations in IMS reported prescription volumes for VYTORIN and ZETIA before any 51 Table of Contents trend can be identified. Wholesalers, retail chains and other trade buyers may respond to these fluctuations by changing their buying patterns or reducing their inventory levels. It is too early to determine the business and financial impact of these lower prescription volumes for 2008 or longer term. However, first quarter 2008 Merck/Schering Plough cholesterol joint venture sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. will likely be negatively impacted. Schering Plough accounts for the joint venture under the equity method. Schering Plough has been successful in advancing several research and development projects into their late stage. These projects will require sizable resources to complete. Research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase over the next several years as a result of the expanded pipeline, the pipeline projects added through the OBS acquisition and the need for larger, more frequent, and longer clinical trials in the current global regulatory environment. The risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. For calendar year companies the standard is effective beginning January 1, 2008 except for non financial items measured on a non recurring basis for which it is effective beginning January 1, 2009. Based on Schering Ploughs current financial position the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (EITF) No. 06 10, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefits Aspects of Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2008. The Task Force concluded that an employer should recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either FASB Statement No. 106 or APB Opinion No. 12 based on the substantive agreement with the employee. The Task Force also concluded that an employer should recognize and measure an asset based on the nature and substance of the collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 also includes an amendment to SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. This statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Based on Schering Ploughs current financial position the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In June 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07 3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities, which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2008. The Task Force concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are 52 Table of Contents delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07 1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements, which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2009. The Task Force clarified the manner in which costs, revenues and sharing payments made to, or received by a partner in a collaborative arrangements should be presented in the income statement and set forth certain disclosures that should be required in the partners financial statements. Schering Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB 110), which permits entities, under certain circumstances, to continue to use the simplified method of estimating the expected term of plain vanilla options as discussed in SAB No. 107 and in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment. The guidance in this release is effective January 1, 2008. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. For calendar year companies, the standard is applicable to new business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. SFAS 141 (R) requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. Most significantly, SFAS 141 (R) will require that acquisition costs generally be expensed as incurred, certain acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value, and acquired in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date. The standard will also impact certain unresolved matters related to purchase transactions consummated prior to the effective date of the standard. Schering Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The standard establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Schering Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and estimates are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect Schering Ploughs financial statements: Revenue Recognition Rebates, Discounts and Returns Provision for Income Taxes Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property Accounting for Pensions and Post retirement Benefit Plans Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers, which include wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations. Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies, other indirect purchasers and other market participants such as managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers. 53 Table of Contents Schering Plough recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs; and iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. When recognizing revenue, Schering Plough estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made; Schering Plough defers the recognition of revenue. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re evaluated as part of this process. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, Schering Plough would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed care organizations and government purchasers and certain other market conditions. Rebates are estimated based on sales and contract terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Schering Plough evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition including expected generic introductions, or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. Schering Ploughs agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers address a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of these agreements, Schering Plough expects to avoid situations where Schering Ploughs shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Schering Ploughs rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Part D, at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $114 million and $115 million, respectively. Commercial discounts, returns, and other rebate accruals at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $412 million and $371 million, respectively. These accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities, or in the case of returns and other receivable adjustments, an allowance provided against accounts receivable. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, Schering Ploughs payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy Schering Ploughs obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 20, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. 54 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2007 2006(1) (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 486 $ 522 OBS accruals acquired November 19, 2007 63 Provision for Rebates 609 474 Adjustment to prior year estimates (31 ) (56 ) Payments (569 ) (460 ) 9 (42 ) Provision for Returns 142 124 Adjustment to prior year estimates (24 ) (8 ) Returns (137 ) (121 ) (19 ) (5 ) Provision for Discounts 752 605 Adjustment to prior year estimates (2 ) (6 ) Discounts granted (763 ) (588 ) (13 ) 11 Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, End of Period $ 526 $ 486 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2006, the adjustment to prior year estimates for rebates includes $24 million related to the reversal of previously accrued rebate amounts recorded in 2005 and 2004 for the U.S. Governments TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program that a U.S. Federal Court ruled pharmaceutical manufacturers were not obligated to pay. In formulating and recording the above accruals, management utilizes assumptions and estimates that include historical experience, wholesaler data, the projection of market conditions, the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate, utilization estimates, and forecasted product demand amounts as discussed under the critical accounting policy entitled Revenue Recognition. As part of its review of these accruals, management performs a sensitivity analysis that considers differing assumptions, which are most subject to judgment in its rebate accrual calculation. Based upon Schering Ploughs sensitivity analysis, reasonably possible changes to assumptions related to rebate accruals could favorably or unfavorably impact 2008 net sales and income before taxes in an amount consistent with 2007. Provision for Income Taxes Schering Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the Interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering Ploughs retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering Plough reduced its January 1, 2007 retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering Ploughs unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering Ploughs tax matters litigation (see Note 20, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters). At January 1, and December 31, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $924 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance, potential refund claims and tax liabilities. At January 1, and December 31, 2007, approximately $645 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the 55 Table of Contents next twelve month period by up to $615 million. This decrease would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court, possible final resolution of the taxpayers 1997 2002 examination at IRS Appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering Ploughs tax matters and the payment and or receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering Ploughs control. Schering Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at January 1, and December 31, 2007 was $193 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. Schering Plough records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Schering Plough has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event Schering Plough were to determine that it would be able to realize all or an additional portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should Schering Plough subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or an additional portion of its remaining net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property Schering Plough accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized based on sales over the expected life of the asset. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, which considers various characteristics of the asset, including projected cash flows. Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $9.9 billion at December 31, 2007. Intangible assets and goodwill increased significantly during 2007 due to the acquisition of OBS. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $570 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2007. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Certain of Schering Ploughs manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the Consent Decree and other compliance activities. Schering Ploughs manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce Schering Ploughs manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments and or related costs. 56 Table of Contents Accounting for Pension and Post retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. Schering Plough assesses its pension and other post retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, Schering Plough considers many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, Schering Ploughs historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (see Note 8, Retirement Plans and Other Post retirement Benefits, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information). Discount rates used for pension and other post retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. Actuarial assumptions are based upon managements best estimates and judgment. With other assumptions held constant, an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of $43 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost and an increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. With other assumptions held constant, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $41 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost and a decrease of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. These sensitivities are based on estimated net pension and post retirement benefit cost in 2008 which includes the annual impact of OBS plans. The expected rates of return for the pension and other post retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Schering Plough determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long term historical data as well as Schering Ploughs actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from Schering Ploughs expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market related value of assets ratably over a five year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering Ploughs U.S. Retirement Plan is allocated 65 percent to equities; 28 percent to fixed income investments; and 7 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering Ploughs U.S. other post retirement benefit plan is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios equity weightings are consistent with the long term nature of the plans benefit obligations. For non U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. Effective December 31, 2006, Schering Plough accounts for its retirement and other post retirement benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158. Shareholders equity at December 31, 2006, was reduced by 57 Table of Contents approximately 7 percent upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158. See Note 8, Retirement Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for additional information. SFAS 158 allows an extended adoption date for the requirement to have Schering Ploughs year end date as the measurement date for all defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. For the plans which had measurement dates other than year end prior to the adoption of SFAS 158, Schering Plough adopted the year end measurement date effective with 2007. The impact on the consolidated financial statements related to this measurement date change was not material. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. Schering Plough reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, Schering Plough may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of Schering Plough. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Schering Ploughs results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE Schering Plough is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Schering Plough has subsidiaries in more than 55 countries. In 2007, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 64 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, Schering Ploughs reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because Schering Ploughs international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover can provide a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that Schering Ploughs international operations are widespread. In addition, at any point in time, Schering Ploughs international subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term, third party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect the translated value of these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, Schering Plough has used derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering Plough purchased euro denominated currency options to mitigate its exposure in the event there was a significant strengthening in the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar. Schering Plough purchased the options for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). Accordingly, the gain on these derivatives was recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of December 31, 2007, there were no open foreign currency option contracts. Schering Ploughs senior unsecured euro denominated notes and euro denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS 52, the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. 58 Table of Contents Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short term investments and the debt and equity securities held in qualified and non qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled more than $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007. For cash equivalents and short term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $36 million. For securities held in qualified and non qualified trusts, due to the long term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, Schering Ploughs exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short term borrowings and the long term floating rate euro denominated term loan. Schering Plough has long term fixed rate debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt by approximately $256 million. During 2007, Schering Plough executed a series of interest rate swaps in anticipation of financing the acquisition of OBS. The objective of the swaps was to hedge the interest rate payments to be made on future issuances of debt. As such, the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of future interest payments, and in accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in operations. In connection with the euro denominated debt issuances as described in Note 14, Borrowings and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, portions of the swaps were deemed ineffective and Schering Plough recognized a $7 million loss in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The effective portion of the swaps of $12 million was recorded in other comprehensive income and is being recognized as interest expense over the life of the related debt. As of December 31, 2007, there were no open interest rate swaps.
