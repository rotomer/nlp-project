Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of Schering Plough Schering Plough is an innovation driven science centered global health care company. Schering Plough discovers, develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals for three customer markets prescription, animal health, and consumer. While most of the research and development activity is directed toward prescription products, there are important applications of this central research and development platform into the animal health products and the consumer health care products. Schering Plough also accesses external innovation via partnering, in licensing and acquisition for all three customer markets. Strategy Focused on Science In 2003, soon after Fred Hassan was elected as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering Plough Corporation, he initiated a six to eight year strategic plan, called the Action Agenda. A key component of the Action Agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs. A core strategy of Schering Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments that address important unmet medical needs and also have commercial value. Consistent with this core strategy, Schering Plough has increased its investment in research and development. Schering Plough has been successful in advancing the pipeline and has several late stage projects that will require sizable resources to complete. Schering Plough continues to develop the later phase pipeline compounds (e.g., golimumab, sugammadex in the U.S., thrombin receptor antagonist, vicriviroc, boceprevir and asenapine), and its progressing early pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Another key component of the Action Agenda is the focus on building long term value for shareholders and for the patients who rely upon Schering Ploughs drugs. This longer term focus includes concurrent emphasis on growing sales, disciplined cost controls and investing in research and development for the future. Early on, Hassan, and the new management team that he recruited, applied the Action Agenda to stabilizing, repairing and turning around Schering Plough after Schering Plough encountered challenges earlier this decade under a prior management team. Currently, Schering Plough continues work in the fourth of five phases of the Action Agenda. During the fourth, or Build the Base phase, Schering Plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front. Over the past five years, sales of Schering Plough pharmaceutical products across an array of therapeutic areas showed strong growth compared to prior periods and other pharmaceutical companies. Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical sales and marketing activities were further expanded in newer markets. This geographic diversity adds to growth and makes performance less sensitive to any one geographic area. Substantial progress was made with the integration of Organon BioSciences N.V. (OBS), purchased from Akzo Nobel in late 2007. That acquisition was transformative, giving Schering Plough: Key new pipeline projects (including asenapine for schizophrenia and bipolar disease and sugammadex to reverse deep anesthesia); Key products in two new therapeutic areas Womens Health and Central Nervous System; A position as a leader in Animal Health by combining Schering Plough Animal Health with Intervet; A leadership position in animal vaccines at Intervet and early stage innovation capabilities in human vaccines at Nobilon; 33 Table of Contents Additional state of the art biologics capabilities; A substantial expansion to the Companys geographic footprint; and Significant talent, including in key research and development functions. In April 2008, Schering Plough announced the Productivity Transformation Program (PTP). The goal of this program, which includes the ongoing integration of OBS, is to create a leaner, stronger company to support Schering Ploughs goal of building long term high performance despite the current challenging pharmaceutical industry environment and the particular challenges facing Schering Plough. This program targets savings of $1.5 billion on an annualized basis by 2012 and is designed to reduce and avoid costs, while increasing productivity. Of the total targeted savings, approximately $1.25 billion are anticipated to be accomplished by the end of 2010 with the balance achieved by 2012. The targeted savings envisioned by this program include those resulting from the previously announced OBS integration synergies. Beyond this program, Schering Plough anticipates investing in new high priority clinical trials, the pursuit of strategic opportunities, including product launches and anticipates natural cost growth. As part of the Action Agenda, Schering Plough continues to work to enhance infrastructure, upgrade processes and systems and strengthen talent. While these efforts are being implemented on a companywide basis, Schering Plough is focusing especially on research and development to support Schering Ploughs science based business. The pharmaceutical industry is under increasing political and regulatory pressure, particularly in the United States and Schering Plough and the Merck/Schering Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture have encountered specific challenges during 2008, as explained in more detail in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, Litigation and Investigations relating to the Merck/Schering Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture. The strength Schering Plough built during the earlier phases of the Action Agenda, including the diversified group of products, customer segments, and geographic areas, as well as its highly experienced executive team, will be helpful in weathering current and future challenges, including those relating to the Merck/Schering Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture. Results and Highlights of Schering Ploughs performance in 2008 are as follows: Schering Ploughs net sales for 2008 were $18.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion, or 46 percent, as compared to 2007. This increase in net sales was primarily due to the contribution of the products from OBS during 2008. For 2008, net sales outside the U.S. totaled $12.9 billion. This approximated 70 percent of consolidated net sales. Net income available to common shareholders for 2008 was $1.8 billion which includes a gain on the divestitures of certain Animal Health products. Increased sales in 2008, of pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX as well as increased sales in the Animal Health segment contributed favorably to Schering Ploughs overall operating results. Overall operating results also benefited from the increased sales of OBS products. Global combined net sales of Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, decreased 11 percent during 2008 as compared 2007. Combined net sales of the products VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. decreased 24 percent during 2008 as compared to 2007. Strategic Alliances As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Schering Plough licenses manufacturing, marketing and or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of Schering Plough that may 34 Table of Contents create positive or negative impacts on Schering Plough. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to Schering Ploughs current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE and golimumab reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(r) in this 10 K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE and golimumab is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(v) in this 10 K. Cholesterol Franchise Schering Ploughs cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are managed through a joint venture between Schering Plough and Merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels in all markets outside of Japan. ZETIA is Schering Ploughs novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor (simvastatin), a statin medication developed by Merck. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck, and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. The cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market. Global total combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA for 2008, decreased 11 percent as compared to 2007. During 2008, total combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. declined 24 percent as compared to 2007. During 2008, total combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA outside the U.S. increased 30 percent as compared to 2007. As of December 2008, total combined prescription share for VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. was down versus December 2007 from 16.9 percent to 10.1 percent. In the past, Schering Ploughs profitability has been largely dependent upon the performance of the cholesterol franchise; while performance of the cholesterol franchise is still material to Schering Plough, as the product diversity has become stronger (through the OBS acquisition as well as development of other Schering Plough products) the dependence on the cholesterol franchise is lessening. Japan is not included in the joint venture with Merck. In the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare is co marketing Schering Ploughs cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, which was approved in Japan in April 2007 as a monotherapy and co administered with a statin for use in patients with hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous sitosterolemia. ZETIA was launched in Japan during June 2007. Schering Ploughs sales of ZETIA in Japan under the co marketing agreement with Bayer Healthcare are recognized in net sales and included in Other Pharmaceuticals. License Arrangements with Centocor REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. REMICADE is Schering Ploughs second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). REMICADE is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson Johnson company. During 2005, Schering Plough exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody which has been filed for approval in Europe. Schering Plough has exclusive marketing rights to both products outside the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. In December 2007, Schering Plough and Centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development, commercialization and distribution of both REMICADE and golimumab, extending Schering Ploughs rights to exclusively market REMICADE to match the duration of Schering Ploughs exclusive marketing rights for golimumab. Effective upon regulatory approval of golimumab in the EU, Schering Ploughs marketing rights for both products will extend for 15 years after the first commercial sale of golimumab within the EU. Centocor will receive a progressively increased share of profits on Schering Ploughs distribution of both products in the Schering Plough marketing territory between 2010 and 2014, and the share of profits will remain fixed thereafter for the remainder of the term. The changes to the duration of REMICADE marketing rights and the profit sharing arrangement for the products are all 35 Table of Contents conditioned on approval of golimumab being granted prior to September 1, 2014. Schering Plough may independently develop and market golimumab for a Crohns disease indication in its territories, with an option for Centocor to participate. In addition, Schering Plough and Centocor agreed to utilize an autoinjector device in the commercialization of golimumab and further agreed to share its development costs. Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Schering Plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. Schering Plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the drug development process (where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets), information technology systems, and post marketing studies and monitoring. Schering Plough continually reviews the business, including manufacturing operations, to identify actions that will enhance long term competitiveness. However, Schering Ploughs manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed, and actions to significantly reduce Schering Ploughs manufacturing infrastructure, including specific reductions in the number of Schering Plough manufacturing facilities that will be made as part of the Productivity Transformation Program involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments or related costs. Regulatory and Competitive Environment Schering Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. Regulatory compliance is complex and costly, impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Schering Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. Research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by the U.S., the EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Schering Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. Clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. A number of intermediaries are involved between drug manufacturers, such as Schering Plough, and patients who use the drugs. These intermediaries impact the patients ability, and their prescribers ability, to choose and pay for a particular drug. These intermediaries include health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics; payors and their representatives, such as employers, insurers, managed care organizations and governments; and others in the supply chain, such as pharmacists and wholesalers. Further, in the U.S., many of Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as certain of the intermediaries (including managed care groups, institutions and government agencies) seek price discounts. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Also, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under continued scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering Ploughs operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering Ploughs products mature. OBS Acquisition On November 19, 2007, Schering Plough acquired OBS for a purchase price of approximately Euro 11 billion in cash, or approximately $16.1 billion. 36 Table of Contents Commencing from the acquisition date, OBSs assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the results of OBSs operations, are included in Schering Ploughs consolidated financial statements. There were approximately one and one half months of results of operations relating to OBS included in Schering Ploughs Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The impact of purchase accounting resulted in the following non cash charges in 2008 and 2007: Acquired In Process Research and Development (IPRD), which was a one time charge of approximately $3.8 billion in 2007. Amortization of inventory adjusted to fair value of approximately $1.1 billion was charged to Cost of Sales ($889 million in 2008 and $258 million in 2007). Amortization of acquired intangible assets adjusted to fair value, of which $6.8 billion will be amortized over a weighted average life of 15 years to Cost of Sales ($527 million in 2008 and $65 million in 2007). Incremental depreciation relating to the adjustment in fair value on property, plant and equipment of approximately $900 million that will be depreciated primarily to Cost of Sales over the lives of the applicable property ($33 million in 2008 and $3 million in 2007). DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS The results of operations in 2008 and 2007 discussed below include OBSs product sales and expenses as well as certain non cash charges relating to purchase accounting associated with the OBS acquisition. Net Sales Consolidated net sales in 2008 were $18.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion or 46 percent as compared to 2007. Consolidated net sales in 2008 included $5.4 billion of net sales of products from OBS. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of OBS, on November 19, 2007. Foreign exchange had an estimated 3% favorable impact on sales in 2008. Since the acquisition of OBS, a greater proportion of Schering Ploughs sales are denominated in Euros. Net sales outside the U.S. are approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales. Consolidated net sales in 2007 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 20 percent compared to 2006. Consolidated net sales in 2007 included $626 million of net sales of products from OBS related to the period subsequent to the acquisition. The increase primarily reflected the growth in sales volumes of REMICADE, TEMODAR, NASONEX and AVELOX as well as contributions from Animal Health and Consumer Health Care and an estimated favorable impact of 4 percent from foreign exchange. A significant portion of U.S. net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler, retail and trade buying decisions, changes in overall demand factors or other factors. In addition to these fluctuations, sales of many pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups, institutions, government agencies, and other groups seeking discounts. Schering Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the U.S. market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the Medicaid program, the veterans health care program, and other government funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. This prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006 and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost containment programs, placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. 37 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 14,253 $ 10,173 $ 8,561 40 % 19 % REMICADE 2,118 1,648 1,240 28 % 33 % NASONEX 1,155 1,092 944 6 % 16 % TEMODAR 1,002 861 703 16 % 22 % PEGINTRON 914 911 837 9 % CLARINEX/AERIUS 790 799 722 (1 )% 11 % FOLLISTIM/PUREGON(1) 577 57 N/M N/M NUVARING(1) 440 45 N/M N/M CLARITIN Rx 425 391 356 9 % 10 % AVELOX 376 384 304 (2 )% 26 % INTEGRILIN 314 332 329 (5 )% 1 % CAELYX 297 257 206 16 % 25 % REBETOL 260 277 311 (6 )% (11 )% ZEMURON(1) 253 25 N/M N/M REMERON(1) 239 33 N/M N/M INTRON A 234 233 237 (2 )% SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE 230 220 203 5 % 8 % ASMANEX 180 162 103 11 % 57 % Other Pharmaceutical 4,449 2,446 2,066 N/M 18 % ANIMAL HEALTH 2,973 1,251 910 138 % 37 % CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,276 1,266 1,123 1 % 13 % OTC 680 682 558 22 % Foot Care 357 345 343 3 % 1 % Sun Care 239 239 222 8 % CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 18,502 $ 12,690 $ 10,594 46 % 20 % (1) Products acquired in OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007 N/M Not a meaningful percentage. Sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2008 totaled $14.3 billion, a $4.1 billion or 40 percent increase compared to 2007. Included in 2008 and 2007 are $3.5 billion and $409 million of net sales related to Organon, the human health business of OBS. Sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2007 totaled $10.2 billion, a $1.6 billion or 19 percent increase compared to 2006. International net sales of REMICADE, a drug for the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis, were up 28 percent to $2.1 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 driven by continued market growth, expanded penetration in certain indications and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. International net sales increased 33 percent in 2007 to $1.6 billion as compared to 2006, due to greater demand, expanded use across indications and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. REMICADE is an anti TNF antibody, marketed by Schering Plough outside of the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. Competitive products for the indications referred to above have been introduced during 2007 and 2008. 38 Table of Contents Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 6 percent to $1.2 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to increased sales in the international market and 16 percent to $1.1 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share in 2007. Competitive products have been introduced in 2007 and 2008. Global net sales of TEMODAR, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 16 percent to $1 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to increased sales across geographic regions. Global net sales increased 22 percent to $861 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased sales across geographic markets, including Japan, where the product was launched in September 2006. TEMODAR will lose patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Global net sales of PEGINTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, were essentially flat in 2008 as compared to 2007, including a favorable impact of foreign exchange. Global net sales increased 9 percent to $911 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to higher sales in Latin America and emerging markets across Europe, and tempered by lower sales in Japan due to increased competition and a decrease in the U.S. market size. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year round indoor allergies, in 2008 decreased 1 percent to $790 million as compared to 2007 primarily due to lower sales in the United States. Global net sales in 2007 increased 11 percent to $799 million as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales in international markets. Global net sales of FOLLISTIM/PUREGON, a recombinant follicle stimulating hormone for treating infertility, were $577 million in 2008 and $57 million for 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007 through December 31, 2007). FOLLISTIM/PUREGON will lose patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Global net sales of NUVARING, a contraception product, were $440 million for 2008 and $45 million for 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007 through December 31, 2007). International net sales of prescription CLARITIN increased 9 percent to $425 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to higher sales in Japan and favorable foreign exchange. Sales in 2007 increased 10 percent to $391 million as compared to 2006, reflecting growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, marketed in the U.S. by Schering Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, decreased 2 percent to $376 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, reflecting a decline in the U.S. respiratory tract infection market. Net sales in 2007 increased 26 percent to $384 million in 2007 as compared to $304 million in 2006, primarily as a result of increased market share. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, that is sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering Plough, decreased 5 percent to $314 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. During 2007, sales increased 1 percent to $332 million as compared to 2006. International net sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposis sarcoma, increased 16 percent to $297 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to higher sales across Europe and favorable foreign exchange. Sales in 2007 increased 25 percent to $257 million as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales in Latin America and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. Global 2008 net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with PEGINTRON or INTRON A for treating hepatitis C, decreased 6 percent to $260 million as compared to 2007 due to lower sales in Japan and continued generic competition. Global net sales in 2007 decreased 11 percent to $277 million as compared to 2006 due to lower patient enrollment in Japan and increased generic competition. 39 Table of Contents Global net sales of ZEMURON, a muscle relaxant used in surgical procedures, were $253 million in 2008 and $25 million in 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007, through December 31, 2007). ZEMURON lost patent exclusivity in the U.S. in October 2008 and will lose patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Global net sales of REMERON, an antidepressant, were $239 million in 2008 and $33 million in 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007, through December 31, 2007). Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, were essentially flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 2 percent in 2007 to $233 million as compared to 2006. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to the conversion to PEGINTRON for treating hepatitis C in Japan. International net sales of SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 5 percent to $230 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales increased 8 percent to $220 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increases in 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from the benefit of foreign exchange. Global net sales of ASMANEX, an orally inhaled steroid for asthma, were up 11 percent to $180 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to market share growth in the U.S. Sales increased to $162 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the increase in sales in the U.S. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products and included $2.0 billion and $249 million of net sales from OBS products for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. These products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 138 percent to approximately $3.0 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. Included in global Animal Health net sales are $1.9 billion related to Intervet, the animal health business of OBS. Global net sales in 2008 benefited from solid growth in all geographic areas, led by the cattle, poultry and companion animal product lines, coupled with a positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Global net sales increased 37 percent in 2007 to $1.3 billion as compared to 2006, reflecting strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas led by higher sales of companion animal products and the inclusion of Intervet sales. The Animal Health segments sales are impacted by intense competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased 1 percent or $10 million as compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 was mainly due to higher sales of MiraLAX, which was launched in February 2007 as the first Rx to OTC switch in the laxative category in more than 30 years, offset by lower sales of other OTC products. OTC CLARITIN sales decreased 12 percent to $405 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of increased competition from private label products. Global net sales in 2007 increased 13 percent or $143 million as compared to 2006 reflecting an increase in sales of sun care products and DR. SCHOLLS products and the launch of MiraLAX. In addition, sales of OTC CLARITIN increased 18 percent to $462 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to sales growth across all product forms. Net sales of sun care products increased $17 million or 8 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to the success of COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products launched in 2005. The consumer health care market is highly competitive, with heavy advertising to consumers and frequent competitive product introductions, including a former prescription antihistamine that was launched for OTC sales in early 2008, and the impact of U.S. consumers purchasing patterns. 40 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin 60.5 % 65.3 % 65.1 % (4.8 )% 0.2 % Selling, general and administrative (SGA) $ 6,823 $ 5,468 $ 4,718 24.8 % 15.9 % Research and development (RD) 3,529 2,926 2,188 20.6 % 33.7 % Acquired in process research and development (IPRD) 3,754 N/M N/M Other expense/(income), net 335 (683 ) (135 ) N/M N/M Special and acquisition related charges 329 84 102 N/M N/M Equity income (1,870 ) (2,049 ) (1,459 ) (9 )% 40.4 % N/M Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in Schering Ploughs net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, Schering Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in Schering Ploughs Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, Schering Ploughs gross margin, and ratios of SGA expenses and RD expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the joint ventures operating results. Gross margin Gross margin was 60.5 percent in 2008 as compared to 65.3 percent in 2007. Gross margin in 2008 and 2007 was unfavorably impacted by $1.4 billion and $326 million, respectively, of purchase accounting adjustments included in cost of sales. These purchase accounting adjustments were a result of the amortization of fair values of primarily inventories and intangible assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. Gross margin in 2007, when compared to 2006, benefited from realized cost savings of approximately $100 million from manufacturing streamlining in 2006, the non recurrence of $146 million of charges associated with the aforementioned manufacturing streamlining actions and favorable product mix. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) increased 25 percent to $6.8 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in SGA is primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from OBS and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the Productivity Transformation Program savings. SGA increased 16 percent to $5.5 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflecting higher promotion spending, ongoing investments in emerging markets and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Research and development Research and development (RD) spending increased 21 percent to $3.5 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. Included in RD in 2007 were upfront payments of $197 million mainly related to certain licensing transactions. The increase in RD spending versus 2007 also reflects increased spending as a result of the OBS acquisition, as well as higher spending for clinical trials and related activities and investments to build greater breadth and capacity to support Schering Ploughs expanding global RD pipeline. In 2007, RD spending increased 34 percent to $2.9 billion as compared to 2006. The 2007 increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical trials, as well as building greater breadth and capacity to support Schering Ploughs pipeline. Changes in RD spending also reflect the timing of Schering Ploughs funding of both internal 41 Table of Contents research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. To maximize its chances for the successful development of new products, Schering Plough began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high priority programs within RD. In 2006, Schering Plough began a Global Clinical Harmonization Program to maximize and globalize the quality of clinical trial execution, pharmacovigilance and regulatory processes. Beginning in 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program have been implemented and continue to be integrated into the processes of OBS. Other expense/(income), net Other expense/(income), net is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Interest cost incurred $ 555 $ 263 $ 184 Less: amount capitalized on construction (19 ) (18 ) (12 ) Interest expense 536 245 172 Interest income (71 ) (395 ) (297 ) Foreign exchange losses/(gains), net 47 (37 ) 2 Gain on sale of divested products (160 ) Realized gain on foreign currency options, net (510 ) Ineffective portion of interest rate swaps 7 Other, net (17 ) 7 (12 ) Total other expense/(income), net $ 335 $ (683 ) $ (135 ) Schering Plough had $335 million of other expense, net, for 2008 and $683 million of other income, net, for 2007. Interest expense was higher in 2008 due to the issuance of new debt in connection with the acquisition of OBS in the second half of 2007. Other expense, net, for 2008 includes $160 million ($149 million after tax) of gain on sale of the divestitures of certain Animal Health products as required by regulatory agencies in U.S. and Europe in connection with the acquisition of OBS. In addition, during 2008, Schering Plough recognized a gain of $17 million ($12 million after tax) on the sale of a manufacturing site. Other income, net, for 2007 included net realized gains on foreign currency options of $510 million related to the OBS acquisition. The increase in Other income, net, in 2007 compared to 2006 also reflected higher interest income due to higher balances of cash equivalents and short term investments partially offset by higher interest expense due to the issuance of new debt. Special and acquisition related charges and manufacturing streamlining 2008 Special and acquisition related charges Special and acquisition related charges relate to the Productivity Transformation Program activities which include the ongoing integration of the OBS business. Special and acquisition related charges for 2008 were $329 million. The costs for 2008 included $275 million of employee termination costs. The remaining charges of $54 million related to integration activities. 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the charges, cash payments and liabilities related to the Productivity Transformation Program, which includes the ongoing integration of OBS, through December 31, 2008: Acquisition Related Liabilities Employee Employee Termination Termination Other Exit Costs Costs Costs (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at December 31, 2007 $ 23 $ 151 $ Charges(a) 254 21 Purchase price allocation items(b) (3 ) 50 Cash payments (154 ) (169 ) (18 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2008 $ 123 $ $ 32 (a) Recorded to special and acquisition related charges. (b) Recorded as part of purchase accounting. Included in acquisition related liabilities at December 31, 2008 are costs to exit certain activities of OBS. 2007 Special and acquisition related charges During the year ended December 31, 2007, Schering Plough incurred $84 million of special and acquisition related charges, comprised of $61 million of integration related costs for the OBS acquisition and $23 million of employee termination costs as part of integration activities. 2006 manufacturing streamlining During 2006, Schering Plough implemented changes to its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and New Jersey that have streamlined its global supply chain and further enhanced Schering Ploughs long term competitiveness. These changes resulted in the phase out and closure of Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations in Manati, Puerto Rico, and additional workforce reductions in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and New Jersey. Special charges: Special charges in 2006 related to the changes in Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations totaled $102 million. These charges consisted of approximately $47 million of severance and $55 million of fixed asset impairments. Cost of Sales: Included in 2006 cost of sales was approximately $146 million consisting of $93 million of accelerated depreciation, $46 million of inventory write offs, and $7 million of other charges related to the closure of Schering Ploughs manufacturing facilities in Manati, Puerto Rico. 43 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activities reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to changes to Schering Ploughs manufacturing operations which were completed in 2006: Charges included in Special Total Cash Non cash Accrued Cost of sales charges charges payments charges Liability (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at January 1, 2006 $ Severance $ $ 47 $ 47 $ (35 ) $ 12 Asset impairments 55 55 (55 ) Accelerated depreciation 93 93 (93 ) Inventory write offs 46 46 (46 ) Other 7 7 (2 ) (5 ) Total $ 146 $ 102 $ 248 $ (37 ) $ (199 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2006 $ 12 Severance $ (12 ) (12 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2007 $ Equity income Sales of the Merck/Schering Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture totaled $4.6 billion, $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The sales decrease in 2008 was due primarily to lower market share in the U.S. partially offset by continued growth in international markets. The sales growth in 2007, as compared to 2006, was due primarily to an increase in market share. The companies bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the cholesterol agreements provide for a reimbursement to each company for physician details that are set on an annual basis, and in Italy, a contractual amount is included in the profit sharing calculation that is not reimbursed. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, this amount is equal to each companys agreed physician details multiplied by a contractual fixed fee. Schering Plough reports these amounts as part of equity income. These amounts do not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs for Schering Ploughs detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, these amounts are not reflective of Schering Ploughs sales effort related to the joint venture, as Schering Ploughs sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. In the U.S. market, Schering Plough receives a greater share of profits on the first $300 million of annual ZETIA sales. Above $300 million of annual ZETIA sales, Merck and Schering Plough generally share profits equally. Costs of the joint venture that the companies contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct to consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out of pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by Schering Plough and Merck. The allergy/asthma agreements provided for the joint development and marketing by the companies of a once daily, fixed combination tablet containing loratadine/montelukast. In April 2008, the Merck/Schering Plough joint venture received a not approvable letter from the FDA for the proposed fixed combination of loratadine/montelukast. During the second quarter of 2008 the respiratory joint venture was terminated in accordance with the agreements. This action has no impact on the cholesterol joint venture. As a result of the 44 Table of Contents termination of the respiratory joint venture, Schering Plough received payments totaling $105 million, which Schering Plough recognized during 2008 in equity income. Equity income from the Merck/Schering Plough joint venture totaled $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 equity income amounts compared to 2007 reflects sales declines of VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. partially offset by sales growth internationally and receipt of $105 million from the termination of the respiratory joint venture. The increase in 2007 equity income as compared to 2006 reflected increased sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA during 2007 as compared to 2006. It should be noted that Schering Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income and instead are included in the overall cost structure of Schering Plough. Provision for income taxes Tax expense was $146 million, $258 million and $362 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 tax provision amounts included tax benefits of $344 million and $89 million, respectively, related to the amortization of fair values of certain assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition and other purchase accounting related items. The tax provisions in 2008, 2007 and 2006 do not include any benefit related to U.S. operating losses. During 2004, Schering Plough established a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. operating losses, as management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. At December 31, 2008, Schering Plough continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Schering Plough expects to report a U.S. Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of $1.3 billion on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2008. This U.S. NOL carryforward could be materially reduced after examination of Schering Ploughs income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Schering Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering Ploughs retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering Plough reduced its January 1, 2007 retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering Ploughs unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering Ploughs tax matters litigation (see Note 21, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $994 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes tax liabilities as well as reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $596 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the next twelve month period up to approximately $625 million. This would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court for which a decision has not yet been rendered, possible final resolution of Schering Ploughs 1997 through 2002 examination by the IRS and appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering Ploughs tax matters and the payment and receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering Ploughs control. Schering Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $63 million and $50 million, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $245 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. 45 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2007, the IRS completed its examination of Schering Ploughs 1997 2002 federal income tax returns. Schering Plough is seeking resolution of an issue raised during this examination through the IRS administrative appeals process. In July 2007, Schering Plough made a payment of $98 million to the IRS pertaining to the 1997 2002 examination. Schering Ploughs tax returns are open for examination with the IRS for the 1997 through 2008 tax years. During 2008, the IRS commenced its examination of the 2003 2006 federal income tax returns. This examination is expected to be completed in 2010. For most of its other significant tax jurisdictions (U.S., state and foreign), Schering Ploughs income tax returns are open for examination for the period 2000 through 2008. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders Schering Plough had a net income/(loss) available to common shareholders of $1.8 billion, $(1.6) billion and $1.1 billion for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2008 and 2007 included approximately $1.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, of charges related to purchase accounting for the OBS acquisition, Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2008, 2007 and 2006 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $150 million, $118 million and $86 million, respectively, related to the 2004 and 2007 mandatory convertible preferred shares. The loss in 2007 was due to the impact of purchase accounting items from the OBS acquisition and increased interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in the second half of 2007. These amounts were partially offset by the impacts of a gain on currency options in the 2007 period and a gain on the divestitures of certain Animal Health products in the 2008 period. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2008, 2007 and 2006 also included special and acquisition related charges and manufacturing streamlining costs of approximately $329 million, $84 million and $248 million, respectively. See Note 3, Special and Acquisition Related Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 3,364 $ 2,630 $ 2,161 Cash flow used for investing activities (532 ) (13,156 ) (2,908 ) Cash flow (used for)/provided by financing activities (1,660 ) 10,089 (1,361 ) Operating Activities In 2008, operating activities provided $3.4 billion of cash, compared with net cash provided by operations of $2.6 billion in 2007. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of the OBS business and the absence of special and acquisition related payments in 2007 associated with the settlement of an investigation by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts involving certain of Schering Ploughs sales, marketing and clinical trial practices and programs (the Massachusetts Investigation). In 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion as compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to a net realized gain of $510 million from foreign currency options relating to the OBS acquisition, higher net sales and equity income, partially offset by payments of $435 million for the settlement of the Massachusetts Investigation and $98 million for tax and interest due in connection with an examination by the IRS of Schering Ploughs 1997 2002 federal income tax returns. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering Plough purchased euro denominated currency options (derivatives) for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of 46 Table of Contents $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives were short term (trading) in nature and did not hedge a specific financing or investment transaction. Accordingly, the cash impacts of these derivatives were classified as operating cash flows in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during 2008 was $532 million and primarily relates to capital expenditures of $747 million partially offset by the proceeds from divested products of $241 million. Net cash used for investing activities in 2007 was $13.2 billion, primarily consisting of $15.8 billion of net cash used to purchase OBS. In addition, the source of cash for investing activities in 2007 included a net reduction of short term investments of $3.3 billion partially offset by $618 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2006 was $2.9 billion primarily related to the net purchases of short term investments of $2.4 billion previously invested in cash equivalents and $458 million of capital expenditures. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities was $1.7 billion for 2008, compared to $10.1 billion of cash provided by financing activities for 2007. Uses of cash for financing activities for 2008 included the pay down of euro denominated long term debt of Euro 600 million and other debt payments (total payments $929 million), payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $572 million and pay down of commercial paper and other short term debt outstanding of $169 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2007 included net proceeds on the issuance of common and preferred shares of approximately $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, and net proceeds of approximately $6.4 billion on the issuance of long term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 also included $225 million of proceeds from stock option exercises offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $481 million. Net cash used for financing activities during 2006 was $1.4 billion, which included the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $412 million and the repayment of $1.0 billion of bank debt and short term commercial paper borrowings. Other Discussion of Cash Flows Schering Plough expects to contribute approximately $350 million to its retirement plans during 2009, including approximately $200 million to the U.S. Schering Plough Retirement Plan. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Schering Plough had net debt (total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable securities) of $4.8 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Cash generated from operations, available cash and short term investments and available credit facilities are expected to provide Schering Plough with the ability to fund cash needs for the intermediate term. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On September 17, 2007, Schering Plough issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes due 2037. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.0 billion. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually. The effective interest rate on the 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes and the 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes, which incorporates the initial discount and debt issuance fees, is 6.13 percent and 6.67 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering Ploughs option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100 percent of the principal amount of such notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the 47 Table of Contents remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the rate of Treasury Notes with comparable remaining terms plus 25 basis points for the 2017 notes or 30 basis points for the 2037 notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, under certain circumstances, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. On October 1, 2007, Schering Plough issued Euro 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes due 2010 and Euro 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes due 2014. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.8 billion. Interest on the notes is payable annually. The effective interest rate on the 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes and the 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro denominated notes, which incorporates the initial discount, debt issuance fees and the impact of interest rate hedges, is 5.10 percent and 5.46 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering Ploughs option at any time, at a redemption price specified in the prospectus. If a change of control triggering event occurs, under certain circumstances, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Schering Plough used the net proceeds from these notes to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. On October 24, 2007, Schering Plough entered into a five year senior unsecured euro denominated term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. On October 31, 2007, Schering Plough drew Euro 1.1 billion ($1.6 billion) on this term loan to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. This term loan has a floating interest rate and requires Schering Plough to maintain a net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the term loan. The term loan also generally restricts Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. At February 27, 2009, the outstanding balance on the euro denominated term loan was Euro 450 million. The reported U.S. dollar amounts of the outstanding debt balance and interest expense on the euro denominated notes and euro denominated term loan will fluctuate due to the impact of foreign currency translation. On November 26, 2003, Schering Plough issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. In connection with ratings downgrades in 2004, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. The interest rate payable on a particular series of notes will return to 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, and the rate adjustment provisions will permanently cease to apply if, the notes are subsequently rated above Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by SP. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moodys or SP is downgraded below A3 or A , respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 15, Borrowings and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. On August 9, 2007, Schering Plough entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and terminated its $1.5 billion credit facility that was due to mature in May 2009. This credit facility has a floating interest rate, matures in August 2012 and requires Schering Plough to maintain a 48 Table of Contents net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the credit facility. The credit facility also generally restricts Schering Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered primarily as support to Schering Ploughs commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances; however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, short term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $245 million and $461 million, respectively. There was no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2008. The weighted average interest rate for short term borrowings at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 7.1 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively. Schering Ploughs senior unsecured euro denominated notes and euro denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (SFAS 52), the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. Credit Ratings Schering Ploughs current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Long Term Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long term Short term Review Status Moodys Investors Service Baa1 P 2 Stable Standard and Poors A A 2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB+ F 2 Stable In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service changed its Long Term Review Status on Schering Ploughs credit ratings from negative outlook to stable. In August 2008, Standard and Poors and Fitch Ratings changed their Long Term Review Status from negative watch to stable. In April 2008, Moodys Investor Service had changed its Long Term Review Status from stable to negative outlook, and Fitch Ratings changed its Long Term Review Status from stable to negative watch. In March 2008, Standard and Poors had changed its Long Term Review Status from stable to negative watch. Schering Plough paid down its entire commercial paper borrowings of $149 million during 2008. From a cash perspective, Schering Plough remains invested in highly liquid and highly rated securities. Schering Plough remains focused on the credit markets and continues to closely monitor the broader financial and economic situation. Schering Plough believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as Schering Plough, with one or more short term credit ratings of P 2 from Moodys, A 2 from SP and or F 2 from Fitch to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short term credit ratings. Further, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers, such as Schering Plough, is typically less than that of higher rated companies. In addition, Schering Ploughs ability to issue commercial paper in the future is dependent on capital market conditions at that time. Schering Ploughs sizable lines of credit with commercial banks as well as cash and short term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries serve as alternative sources of liquidity. Schering Ploughs credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on a portion of Schering Ploughs short and long term debt. As discussed above, Schering Plough believes that existing 49 Table of Contents cash and short term investments, available credit facilities and cash generated from operations will allow Schering Plough to fund its cash needs for the intermediate term. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On August 15, 2007, Schering Plough issued 10,000,000 shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the 2007 Preferred Stock) with a face value of $2.5 billion. Net proceeds to Schering Plough were approximately $2.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2007 Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. Each share of the 2007 Preferred Stock will automatically convert into between 7.4206 and 9.0909 common shares of Schering Plough depending on the average closing price of Schering Ploughs common shares over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the mandatory conversion date of August 13, 2010, as defined in the prospectus. The preferred shareholders may elect to convert at any time prior to August 13, 2010, at the minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares per share of the 2007 Preferred Stock. Additionally, if at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date the closing price of Schering Ploughs common shares exceeds $50.53 (for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days), Schering Plough may elect to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of the 2007 Preferred Stock then outstanding at the same minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares for each share of 2007 Preferred Stock. The 2007 Preferred Stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of 6 percent on shares outstanding. The dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and, to the extent Schering Plough is legally permitted to pay dividends and the Board of Directors declares a dividend payable, Schering Plough will pay dividends on each dividend payment date. The dividend payment dates are February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. During the year ended December 31, 2007, all shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued on August 10, 2004 (the 2004 Preferred Stock) were converted into 64,584,929 shares of Schering Plough common stock. Equity Issuance and Treasury Shares On August 15, 2007, Schering Plough issued 57,500,000 common shares from treasury shares at $27.50 per share. Net proceeds to Schering Plough were approximately $1.5 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the common shares to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. See Note 2, Acquisition, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Schering Plough has various contractual obligations that are reported as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and others that are not required to be recognized as liabilities such as certain purchase 50 Table of Contents commitments and other executory contracts. The following table summarizes payments due by period under Schering Ploughs known contractual obligations at December 31, 2008. Payments Due by Period 2014 and Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter (Dollars in millions) Short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt $ 245 $ 245 $ $ $ Long term debt obligations 7,931 722 1,973 5,236 Interest related to debt obligations 5,568 479 853 794 3,442 Operating lease obligations 558 165 218 99 76 Purchase obligations(1) 2,780 2,601 125 38 16 Deferred compensation plan obligations 153 74 20 25 34 Other obligations(2) 1,506 846 258 200 202 Total $ 18,741 $ 4,410 $ 2,196 $ 3,129 $ 9,006 (1) Purchase obligations include advertising and research contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other inventory and expense items. Potential milestone payments of approximately $2 billion were not included in the contractual obligations table as they are contingent on the achievement of various research and development (approximately $370 million), regulatory approval (approximately $630 million) or sales based (approximately $1 billion) milestones. Research, development and regulatory milestones depend upon future clinical developments as well as regulatory agency actions which may never occur. Sales based milestones are contingent on generating levels of sales of current or future products that have not yet been achieved. (2) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of Schering Ploughs pension plans, preferred stock dividends, managements estimate of the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SCHERING PLOUGH OPERATES Schering Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. The regulations to which Schering Plough is subject are described in more detail in Part I, Item I, Business, of this 10 K. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is also costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Much is still unknown about the science of human health and with every drug there are benefits and risks. Societal and governmental pressures are constantly shifting between the demand for innovation to meet urgent unmet medical needs and adversity to risk. These pressures impact the regulatory environment and the market for Schering Ploughs products. Regulatory Compliance and Pharmacovigilance Regulatory Inspections Schering Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction 51 Table of Contents to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the drugs manufacturer and the governmental agency to potential problems. In February 2006, Schering Plough began the Global Clinical Harmonization Program for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which is strengthening Schering Ploughs scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. In 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program were implemented, and significant work continued in 2008 and is expected to continue for several years. Schering Plough intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. Schering Plough remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Like other pharmaceutical companies, Schering Plough is subject to inspections by the FDA, the EMEA and other regulatory authorities. Possible actions include demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against Schering Plough and or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering Ploughs products. Regulatory Compliance and Post Marketing Surveillance Schering Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. These clinical trial research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., EU and local country regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with current Good Clinical Practices or other applicable laws or regulations can result in delays in approval of clinical trials, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, delays in approval of marketing authorizations, criminal sanctions against Schering Plough and or responsible individuals, financial penalties, and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering Ploughs products. Clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. For the past several years, these occurrences have increased. In 2008, the intense media attention to the results of the ENHANCE clinical trial led to some concerns among patients and prescribers about ZETIA and VYTORIN (see discussion under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, Litigation and Investigations relating to the Merck/Schering Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture). Following this wave of product withdrawals by other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA have continued to increase their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. The FDA, in particular, was granted new legislative authority in 2007 which included several provisions focused on drug safety and pharmacovigilance, including the ability to mandate labeling changes and require post approval evaluations and studies. In addition, some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties and potential delays in the regulatory approval processes. There also continues to be significant regulatory and legislative scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and in particular direct to consumer advertising. Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA in Japan, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products and has added to the uncertainty in predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog and has made some progress over the last two years, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 52 Table of Contents In the U.S., the new Presidential Administration has announced that health care reform, including regulation of pharmaceutical companies and their products, is a priority. The Administration has not yet named a Health and Human Services Secretary or the FDA Commissioner, who may initiate further change. The impact of such actions, as well as budget pressures on governments in the U.S. and other nations, cannot be predicted at this time. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect Schering Ploughs operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. Schering Plough has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, BRIDION (in Europe), NOXAFIL, CLARINEX D 24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D 12, SUBOXONE and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the U.S., PEGINTRON, ZETIA, TEMODAR, ESMERON/ESLAX, NASONEX and GANIREST in Japan, and new indications for REMICADE. Schering Plough also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval, including golimumab in Europe, sugammadex in the U.S. and SAPHRIS (asenapine) in the U.S. Schering Ploughs personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA, EMEA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Pricing Pressures As described more specifically in Note 21, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the FTC and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject Schering Plough to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Schering Plough also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on Schering Ploughs results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. For instance, third party payors use formulary restrictions to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for inclusion in the formulary. A change in the formulary status of a product may impact the sales of that product. In the U.S. market, Schering Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare and has resulted in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements; emphasized greater use of generic drugs; and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs. 53 Table of Contents Since Schering Plough is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of future decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. Competition The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering Ploughs operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering Ploughs products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2009 OUTLOOK Schering Plough does not provide numeric guidance. However, the following outlook may be helpful to readers in assessing future prospects. Uncertainties in the financial and credit markets, along with generally difficult business conditions, have contributed recently to pressures on companies in the U.S., including pharmaceutical companies. While further development of these economic effects, along with potential for healthcare reforms at the federal or state level in the U.S. are difficult to predict, Schering Plough plans to remain flexible in managing its business in the face of these challenges. Given the current uncertainties in the cholesterol markets, it remains difficult to predict the long term performance of the cholesterol franchise. Currently, Schering Plough believes that 2009 U.S. sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are expected to be lower than in 2008 while international sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, should continue to grow. For the full year 2009, Schering Plough currently expects RD spending to grow in the mid single digit range. The risks set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this 10 K could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectation provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. For calendar year companies, the standard became effective January 1, 2008 (see Note 17, Fair Value Measurements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) except for non financial items measured on a non recurring basis for which it is effective beginning January 1, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering Ploughs financial statements. Based on Schering Ploughs current financial position, the impact of the provisions of this standard that are effective January 1, 2009 is not expected to be material. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159), which permits 54 Table of Contents entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 also includes an amendment to SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. For calendar year companies, the standard became effective January 1, 2008. Schering Plough chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by SFAS 159. As a result, the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering Ploughs financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07 1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements, which is effective for calendar year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The Task Force clarified the manner in which costs, revenues and sharing payments made to, or received by, a partner in a collaborative arrangement should be presented in the income statement and set forth certain disclosures that should be required in the partners financial statements. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R). For calendar year companies, the standard is applicable to new business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. SFAS 141R requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. Most significantly, SFAS 141R will require that acquisition costs generally be expensed as incurred, certain acquired contingent liabilities be recorded at fair value, and acquired in process research and development be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date. The standard will also impact certain unresolved matters related to purchase transactions consummated prior to the effective date of the standard. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material, but this standard may have an effect on accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51, which is effective for calendar year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The standard establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which is effective for calendar year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The standard enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142 3). FSP 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). FSP 142 3 is effective for calendar year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The requirement for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the effective date. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This standard identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy). SFAS No. 162 became effective on November 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering Ploughs financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF No. 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. The FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described 55 Table of Contents in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. The FSP requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. The FSP is effective for calendar year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 3 Determining Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3). FSP 157 3 clarified the application of SFAS No. 157 in an inactive market. It demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive. FSP 157 3 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering Ploughs financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest Entities. FSP No. FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities. The FSP is effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2008. Since the FSP requires only additional disclosures concerning transfers of financial assets and interest in variable interest entities, adoption of this FSP did not affect Schering Ploughs disclosures. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and estimates are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect Schering Ploughs financial statements: Revenue Recognition Rebates, Discounts and Returns Provision for Income Taxes Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property Accounting for Pensions and Post retirement Benefit Plans Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition Schering Ploughs pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers, which include wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations. Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies, other indirect purchasers and other market participants such as managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers. Schering Plough recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs; and iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. Revenue recognition also requires that there is reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds. When recognizing revenue, Schering Plough estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, Schering Plough defers the recognition of revenue. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re evaluated as part of this process. 56 Table of Contents Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, Schering Plough would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed care organizations and government purchasers and certain other market conditions. Rebates are estimated based on sales and contract terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Schering Plough evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition including expected generic introductions, or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. Schering Ploughs agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers address a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of these agreements, Schering Plough expects to avoid situations where Schering Ploughs shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Schering Ploughs rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Part D, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were $162 million and $114 million, respectively. Commercial discounts, returns and other rebate accruals at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were $373 million and $412 million, respectively. These accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities, or in the case of returns and other receivable adjustments, an allowance provided against accounts receivable. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, Schering Ploughs payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy Schering Ploughs obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 21, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially differ from amounts accrued. 57 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 526 $ 486 OBSs accruals acquired November 19, 2007 63 Provision for Rebates 759 609 Adjustment to prior year estimates (7 ) (31 ) Payments (720 ) (569 ) 32 9 Provision for Returns 143 142 Purchase accounting adjustments(1) (9 ) Adjustment to prior year estimates (4 ) (24 ) Returns (146 ) (137 ) (16 ) (19 ) Provision for Discounts 897 752 Adjustment to prior year estimates (6 ) (2 ) Discounts granted (898 ) (763 ) (7 ) (13 ) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, End of Period $ 535 $ 526 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2008, purchase accounting adjustments reflect $9 million related to the reversal of return reserves recorded as part of the purchase accounting for OBS. This reversal was recorded as a reduction to goodwill. In formulating and recording the above accruals, management utilizes assumptions and estimates that include historical experience, wholesaler data, the projection of market conditions, the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate, utilization estimates, and forecasted product demand amounts as discussed under the critical accounting policy entitled Revenue Recognition. As part of its review of these accruals, management performs a sensitivity analysis that considers differing assumptions, which are most subject to judgment in its rebate accrual calculation. Based upon Schering Ploughs sensitivity analysis, reasonably possible changes to assumptions related to rebate accruals could favorably or unfavorably impact 2009 net sales and income before taxes in an annual amount consistent with prior years. This sensitivity analysis excludes the potential impacts of a specific matter that involves interpretations of statutes and could have a favorable impact on net sales and income before taxes in future periods. Provision for Income Taxes Schering Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering Ploughs retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering Plough reduced its January 1, 2007, retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering Ploughs unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering Ploughs tax 58 Table of Contents matters litigation (see Note 21, Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $994 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes tax liabilities as well as reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $596 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the next twelve month period up to approximately $625 million. This would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court for which a decision has not yet been rendered, possible final resolution of Schering Ploughs 1997 through 2002 examination by the IRS and appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering Ploughs tax matters and the payment and receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering Ploughs control. Schering Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $63 million and $50 million, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $245 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property Schering Plough accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected life of the asset. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, which considers various characteristics of the asset, including projected cash flows. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a two step approach. First, the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a second step would be performed, whereby the reporting units assets and liabilities are fair valued. To the extent that the reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment exists and would be recognized. Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $8.9 billion and $9.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Intangible assets and goodwill increased significantly during 2007 due to the acquisition of OBS. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $570 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2008. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Certain of Schering Ploughs manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased over the past several years due to compliance activities. Schering Ploughs manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to 59 Table of Contents significantly reduce Schering Ploughs manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments and or related costs. Accounting for Pension and Post retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. Schering Plough assesses its pension and other post retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, Schering Plough considers many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, Schering Ploughs historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (see Note 9, Retirement Plans and Other Post retirement Benefits, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information). Discount rates used for pension and other post retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. Actuarial assumptions are based upon managements best estimates and judgment. With other assumptions held constant, an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of $52 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost and an increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. With other assumptions held constant, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $52 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost, and a decrease of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post retirement benefit cost. These sensitivities are based on estimated net pension and post retirement benefit cost in 2008 which includes the annual impact of OBSs plans. The expected rates of return for the pension and other post retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Schering Plough determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long term historical data as well as Schering Ploughs actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects active management as appropriate. During 2008, conditions in the worldwide debt and equity markets deteriorated significantly. These conditions have had a negative effect on the fair value of plan assets. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from Schering Ploughs expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market related value of assets ratably over a five year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. Schering Ploughs practice is to fund qualified pension plans at least at sufficient amounts to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable laws. Schering Plough expects to contribute approximately $350 million to its retirement plans during 2009, including approximately $200 million to the U.S. Schering Plough Retirement Plan. 60 Table of Contents The targeted investment portfolio of Schering Ploughs U.S. Retirement Plan is allocated 65 percent to equities; 29 percent to fixed income investments; and 6 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering Ploughs U.S. other post retirement benefit plan is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios equity weightings are consistent with the long term nature of the plans benefit obligations. For non U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. Schering Plough reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, Schering Plough may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of Schering Plough. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Schering Ploughs results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE Schering Plough is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Schering Plough has subsidiaries in more than 55 countries. In 2008, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 70 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, Schering Ploughs reported sales, profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because Schering Ploughs international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover can provide a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that Schering Ploughs international operations are widespread. The net assets of most of Schering Ploughs international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation account as a separate component of Shareholders Equity. For the remaining international subsidiaries, non monetary assets and liabilities are translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes included in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. On occasion, Schering Plough has used derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering Plough purchased euro denominated currency options to mitigate its exposure in the event there was a significant strengthening in the Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Schering Plough purchased the options for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). Accordingly, the gain on these derivatives were recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no open foreign currency option contracts. 61 Table of Contents Schering Ploughs senior unsecured euro denominated notes and euro denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS 52, the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short term investments and the debt and equity securities held in non qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled more than $3.4 billion at December 31, 2008. For cash equivalents and short term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have decreased interest income by approximately $6 million in 2008. For securities held in qualified and non qualified trusts, due to the long term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, Schering Ploughs exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short term borrowings and the long term floating rate euro denominated term loan. Schering Plough has long term fixed rate debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt at December 31, 2008, by approximately $135 million. During 2007, Schering Plough executed a series of interest rate swaps in anticipation of financing the acquisition of OBS. The objective of the swaps was to hedge the interest rate payments to be made on future issuances of debt. As such, the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of future interest payments, and in accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion was reported in operations. In connection with the euro denominated debt issuances as described in Note 15, Borrowings and Other Commitments, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, portions of the swaps were deemed ineffective, and Schering Plough recognized a $7 million loss in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The effective portion of the swaps of $12 million was recorded in other comprehensive income in 2007 and is being recognized as interest expense over the life of the related debt. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no open interest rate swaps.
