PART I Item 1. and 2. Business and Properties General Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the "Separation"), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation. Before December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and USX U.S. Steel Group common stock ("Steel Stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, Marathon disposed of its steel business through a tax free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation ("United States Steel") to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one for one basis. In connection with the Separation, Marathons certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and, from that date, Marathon has only one class of common stock authorized. Our principal operating subsidiaries are Marathon Oil Company and Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC ("MAP"). Marathon Oil Company and its predecessors have been engaged in the oil and gas business since 1887. MAP is 62 percent owned by Marathon and 38 percent owned by Ashland Inc. ("Ashland"). Segment and Geographic Information Our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production ("E&P") explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas; 2) Refining, Marketing and Transportation ("RM&T") refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products; and 3) Integrated Gas ("IG") markets and transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and methanol. For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page F 19. Exploration and Production We are currently conducting exploration, development and production activities in nine countries. Principal exploration activities are in the United States, Norway, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Canada. Principal development and production activities are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Russia. We are also pursuing opportunities in north and west Africa and the Middle East. 2 Our 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 170,000 barrels per day ("bpd"), a decrease of 12 percent from 2003 levels. Our 2004 worldwide sales of natural gas production, including gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 999 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd"), a decrease of 15 percent compared to 2003. In total, our 2004 worldwide production averaged 337,000 barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") per day, compared to 389,000 boe per day in 2003. (For purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ("mcf ") by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) In 2005, our worldwide production is expected to average approximately 325,000 to 350,000 boe per day, excluding acquisitions and dispositions. The above projection of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production volumes is a forward looking statement. Some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels of production include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, future acquisitions or dispositions of producing properties, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statement. Exploration In the United States during 2004, we drilled 35 gross (17 net) exploratory wells of which 22 gross (10 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. Of these 22 wells, 3 gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. Internationally, we drilled 21 gross (16 net) exploratory wells of which 13 gross (10 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. Of these 13 wells, 13 gross (9 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. United States The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area for us with the potential to add new reserves. At the end of 2004, we had interests in 123 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, including 94 in the deepwater area. During 2004, we announced that the Neptune 7 appraisal well on the Neptune Unit in the Gulf of Mexico encountered hydrocarbons. This discovery follows the Neptune 3 discovery in 2002 and the Neptune 5 discovery in 2003. Two successful appraisal sidetrack wells also were drilled from the original Neptune 5 location. Front end engineering and design for a Neptune development is currently underway. We hold a 30 percent interest in the Neptune Unit. Announced in 2003, the Perseus discovery is located on Viosca Knoll Block 830 in the Gulf of Mexico approximately five miles from the existing Petronius platform. The Perseus discovery was expected to begin production in 2004 via an extended reach well drilled from the Petronius platform. Due to hurricane activity in September 2004 and the resulting damage to the Petronius platform, production from Perseus has been delayed until repairs of the Petronius platform can be completed. We hold a 50 percent interest in the Perseus discovery. In 2001 a successful discovery well was drilled on the Ozona prospect in the Gulf of Mexico and in 2002 two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. We have established an integrated project team to formulate a development plan. We are currently negotiating commercial terms of a production handling agreement with a nearby operator. We are also in the process of reviewing seismic data to obtain a better understanding of the complex salt formations in the area and to optimize the location of the next well. We hold a 68 percent interest in the Ozona prospect. Other United States exploration activity during 2004 included three wells in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska, two of which were discoveries, and 11 wells in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, nine of which were discoveries. Norway During 2004 we announced the Hamsun discovery. The well is located on production license (PL) 150, which is approximately 136 miles from Stavanger, Norway, and approximately six miles south of the Alvheim area. The discovery well and three sidetracks encountered oil and gas. Results are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie back to the Alvheim development. We are the operator of PL150, owning a 65 percent interest. The Hamsun well builds on our successful 2003 Norwegian drilling program, which resulted in three discoveries, the Kneler and Boa discoveries in the Alvheim development and the Vilje (formerly known as Klegg) discovery. In December 2004 we acquired four new Norwegian exploration licenses, three of which we are designated as operator. Angola Offshore Angola, we own a 10 percent interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent interest in Block 32. During 2004, we participated in the Venus 1 well, the fourth oil discovery on Block 31. The Venus well is located near the 3 Plutao, Saturno and Marte discoveries in the northeast portion of Block 31. These discoveries are the basis for a planned development of the northeast area of Block 31. Development options are currently being evaluated. During late 2004, we participated in a well on the Palas prospect in the southern portion of Block 31, and in early 2005, it was announced as a discovery. Also, at the end of 2004, operations were ongoing at the Ceres prospect, located in the central portion of Block 31. During 2004, we announced the Canela discovery on Block 32, located about 10 miles south of the 2003 Gindungo discovery. Also in 2004, wells on the Cola and Gengibre prospects, both on Block 32, reached total depth. The Cola well encountered hydrocarbons, but additional drilling will be required to determine commerciality. The results of the Gengibre well will be announced following government approval. Equatorial Guinea During 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the Alba Block offshore Equatorial Guinea. The Deep Luba discovery well, drilled from the Alba field production platform, encountered gas and condensate in several pay zones. The Gardenia discovery well is located approximately 11 miles southwest of the Alba Field. We are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries. These discoveries reinforce the potential of the Alba Block, in which we own a 63 percent interest. In 2003, we announced a natural gas discovery on Block D offshore Equatorial Guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. The discovery well is on the Bococo prospect, which is approximately six miles west of the Alba field. The well has been suspended for reentry at a later date. Development scenarios for the Bococo gas discovery along with three earlier dry gas discoveries on Block D are being considered for further development. Canada In 2002, we announced a gas discovery at the Annapolis G 24 deepwater wildcat well approximately 215 miles south of Halifax, Nova Scotia in 5,504 feet of water. The G 24 encountered gas pay over several zones. The Crimson well, six miles southeast of the Annapolis discovery, was drilled in 2004 and was plugged and abandoned. We are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the Annapolis lease. In addition, we operate the adjacent Cortland lease where we own a 75 interest and the adjacent Empire lease where we own a 50 percent interest. Production (including development activities) United States Approximately 48 percent of our 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production and 63 percent of our worldwide natural gas production was produced from U.S. operations. During 2004, our production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 35,700 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 44 percent of our total U.S. liquid hydrocarbon production, and 100 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 16 percent of our total U.S. natural gas production. Liquid hydrocarbon production decreased by 17,800 net bpd and natural gas production decreased by 36 net mmcfd from the prior year. The decrease in production is mainly due to natural field declines and the effects of hurricane activity. Our Petronius platform suffered significant damage from Hurricane Ivan and was out of service part of September and the entire fourth quarter of 2004. Repair activity is underway, but production of liquid hydrocarbons of approximately 19,000 net bpd and natural gas of approximately 32 net mmcfd remains shut in. Production is not expected to come back on stream until the second quarter of 2005. At year end 2004, we held interests in eight producing fields and 11 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, of which seven platforms are operated by Marathon. Our natural gas production from Alaska is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first quarter. In 2004 our Alaskan natural gas production averaged 174 net mmcfd, representing 28 percent of our total U.S. gas production. The increase from 2003 production of 166 net mmcfd is primarily due to a full year of production from the Ninilchik field. Production from the Ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. Ninilchik gas is transported through the 32 mile portion of the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline, which connects Ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the Kenai Peninsula, in Anchorage and in other parts of south central Alaska. We operate the Ninilchik Unit and own a 60 percent interest in it and the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline. Liquid hydrocarbon production from our Wyoming fields averaged 21,200 net bpd in 2004 compared to 21,400 net bpd in 2003. Gas production from our Wyoming fields averaged 108 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 127 net mmcfd in 2003. The decrease in our Wyoming gas production is primarily attributed to lower production from the Powder River Basin, which averaged 69 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 82 net mmcfd in 2003. This decrease is primarily attributed to natural field decline. Development of the Powder River Basin continued in 2004 with approximately 230 wells drilled, of which 145 are yet to be completed, compared to approximately 320 wells drilled in 2003. Additional development of our southwest Wyoming interests continued in 2004 where we participated in the drilling of 18 wells. Gas production from our Oklahoma fields averaged 82 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 96 net mmcfd in 2003. This 4 decrease is primarily attributed to natural field decline. Our 2004 development program continued to focus in the Anadarko Basin where we participated in the drilling of 53 wells. Our share of liquid hydrocarbon production from the Permian Basin region, which extends from southeast New Mexico to west Texas averaged 18,900 bpd in 2004, compared to 30,200 bpd in 2003. This decrease is principally due to natural field decline and the sale of the Yates field in November 2003. Gas production from our New Mexico fields, primarily the Indian Basin field, averaged 85 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 122 net mmcfd in 2003. The decrease in natural gas production is due to natural field decline. Gas production from our Texas fields, primarily located in East Texas, averaged 65 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 73 net mmcfd in 2003. This decrease is mostly due to natural field decline. Active development of the Mimms Creek field in East Texas continued in 2004 with the drilling of 26 wells. United Kingdom Our largest asset in the U.K. North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and own a 42 percent interest in the South, Central, North, and West Brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central Brae field and West Brae/Sedgwick fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field are gas condensate fields. Our share of production from the Brae area averaged 15,900 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2004, compared with 17,500 bpd in 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from natural field decline. Our share of Brae gas sales averaged 197 mmcfd in 2004 compared with 198 mmcfd in 2003. The strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, there are 22 agreements with third party fields contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third party business also has a favorable impact on Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex. The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation ("SAGE") system. The Beryl group owns the remaining 50 percent. The SAGE pipeline transports gas from the Brae and Beryl areas and has a total wet gas capacity of approximately 1,000 mmcfd. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes gas from the SAGE pipeline and 0.8 billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day of third party gas from the Britannia field. In the U.K. Atlantic Margin, we own an approximately 30 percent interest in the outside operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent of East Foinaven and 20 percent of the T35 and T25 accumulations, each of which has a single well. Our share of production from the Foinaven fields averaged 21,900 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd of natural gas in 2004, compared to 22,400 net bpd and 10 mmcfd in 2003. Norway We are the operator and own a 65 percent interest in the Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development is comprised of the Kneler and Boa discoveries and the previously undeveloped Kameleon accumulation. During 2004, we received approval from the Norwegian authorities for our Alvheim plan of development and operation ("PDO"), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ("FPSO") with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and associated flow lines. The PDO also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the SAGE system using a new 14 inch, 24 mile cross border pipeline. Marathon and its Alvheim project partners signed a purchase and sale agreement in 2004 for the Odin multipurpose shuttle tanker, which will be modified to an FPSO. Also during 2004, the Alvheim partners reached agreement to tie in the nearby Vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, subject to the approval of the Vilje PDO which was submitted to the Norwegian government in December 2004. Production from a combined Alvheim/Vilje development is expected to reach more than 50,000 net boe per day with first production starting in 2007. During 2004, production in Norway from the Heimdal, Vale and Byggve/Skirne fields averaged 2,000 net bpd and 27 net mmcfd. We own a 24 percent interest in the Heimdal field, a 47 percent interest in the Vale field and a 20 percent interest in the Byggve/Skirne field, which came on stream during 2004. Ireland We own a 100 percent interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale fields in the Celtic Sea offshore Ireland. Natural gas sales were 58 mmcfd in 2004, compared with 62 mmcfd in 2003. We have agreed with the Seven Heads group to process and transport gas, as well as to provide field operating services, through our existing Kinsale Head facilities. Production from Seven Heads commenced in December 2003. We own an 18.5 percent interest in the Corrib gas development project, located approximately 40 miles off Irelands west coast. During 2004, the An Bord Plean&aacute;la upheld the Mayo County Councils decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge, County Mayo, which will process gas from the 5 Corrib field. This decision represents a major step forward for the outside operated Corrib gas project. Development work on the Corrib project has resumed and first gas production is expected in mid year 2007. Equatorial Guinea We own a 63 percent interest in the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant held through an equity method investee. During 2004 liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 18,900 bpd and natural gas production averaged 76 mmcfd, compared to 12,400 bpd and 66 mmcfd in 2003. The condensate expansion project was completed during 2004 and began its production ramp up. This expansion project is expected to increase total liquids production from approximately 20,000 gross bpd to approximately 57,000 gross bpd (32,000 bpd net to Marathon). By the end of 2004 liquids production had increased to approximately 45,800 gross bpd. The liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") expansion project progressed during 2004 and is expected to start up in the second quarter of 2005. When completed, gross liquids production is expected to increase from approximately 57,000 gross bpd to 79,000 gross bpd (44,500 bpd net to Marathon). Approximately 125 mmcfd of dry gas remaining after the condensate and LPG are removed is supplied to Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC ("AMPCO") where it is used to manufacture methanol. We own 45 percent of AMPCO, which is reported in the Integrated Gas segment. Remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba reservoir for later production when the LNG project on Bioko Island is completed. Gabon We are the operator of the Tchatamba South, Tchatamba West and Tchatamba Marin fields offshore Gabon with a 56 percent working interest. Production in Gabon averaged 13,600 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2004, compared with 14,700 net bpd in 2003. Production from these three fields is processed on a single facility at Tchatamba Marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to a non operated storage facility. During 2004, we extended our license in Gabon for 10 years which will now expire in 2018. Russia During 2003 we acquired Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation ("KMOC"). KMOCs fields are located in the Khanty Mansiysk region of western Siberia. Production from these assets averaged 16,600 net bpd during 2004, primarily from the Potanay and East Kamennoye fields. Development activities continued in these fields in 2004, with 35 wells drilled in East Kamennoye and 17 wells drilled in Potanay. Additionally, one well was drilled in 2004 on the Paitykhskoye license. Libya We own a 16.3 percent interest in the approximately 13 million acre Waha concession in Libya. In 1986, we ceased active participation in the concessions following the imposition of trade sanctions by the U.S. government. In 2004 the U.S. government lifted the sanctions, allowing us to advance plans to return to production operations. We continue to work with our partners, including the Libyan government, to finalize the terms of a reentry agreement. Gas to liquids During 2004, Marathon and Syntroleum Corporation ("Syntroleum") successfully completed the construction and operation of a gas to liquids ("GTL") demonstration plant at the Port of Catoosa, Oklahoma. This GTL project was part of an ultra clean fuels production and demonstration project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energys National Energy Technology Laboratory. The Catoosa plant, which mirrors a commercial scale plant, successfully demonstrated a fully integrated GTL technology that converted natural gas into a finished fuel, producing more than 5,500 barrels of synthetic products, including ultra clean diesel fuel, which was delivered to Integrated Concepts Research Corporation, a project partner, for fleet vehicle testing in Washington, DC and Denali National Park, Alaska. The Catoosa GTL plant supports our ongoing efforts to explore the potential of GTL technology, and demonstrates how such technology could be incorporated into the design of a commercial GTL facility such as our proposed gas processing project in Qatar. Future research of GTL technology as well as other gas technologies is being conducted in our integrated gas segment. In connection with construction of the Catoosa GTL plant, we advanced Syntroleum $21.3 million under a secured promissory note. The note bears interest at a rate of eight percent per year and matures on June 30, 2006. If Syntroleum does not repay the note by June 30, 2006, we will have the right to convert the note into credits against future license fees or into Syntroleum common stock at no less than $6.00 per share and no more than $8.50 per share. The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward looking statements with respect to the timing of resumption of production from the Petronius platform and the timing and levels of production from the combined Alvheim/Vilje project, the Corrib project, the LPG expansion project and other expansion projects. Some factors which could affect the timing of the resumption of production from the Petronius platform include unforeseen problems arising from the repair work or further severe weather conditions. Some factors which could affect the timing and production levels of the Alvheim/Vilje project, the Corrib project, the LPG expansion project and other expansion projects include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, inability or delays in obtaining necessary government or third party approvals or permits, including Norwegian regulatory approval for the Vilje PDO, unforeseen problems arising from construction, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the 6 governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Reserves At December 31, 2004, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled approximately 1.139 billion boe, of which 37 percent were located in the United States. The following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years.

(b)Represents Marathons western Canadian assets, which were sold in 2003. (c)Represents Marathons equity interest in CLAM, which was sold in 2003. Proved developed reserves represented 62 percent of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2004, as compared to 70 percent as of December 31, 2003. Of the 430 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2004, only 22 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than two years while 56 percent were added during 2004. 7 During 2004, we added net proved reserves of 221 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 122 million boe. These net additions included extensions, discoveries and other additions of 136 million boe and total revisions of 81 million boe. Of the total net reserve additions, 25 million boe were proved developed and 194 million boe were proved undeveloped. Additionally, we transferred 78 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed during 2004. Costs incurred for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, were $708 million, $780 million and $404 million. These amounts include our proportionate share of equity investees costs incurred as these were costs necessary for the development of proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2004, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2005 through 2007 are projected to be $718 million, $629 million, and $105 million. The most significant extensions, discoveries and other additions in 2004 are related to the Alvheim/Vilje developments in Norway and the Corrib development in Ireland. Reserve additions for the Alvheim/Vilje developments totaled 63 million boe, or 46% of total extensions, discoveries and other additions. The PDO for the Alvheim development was approved by the Norwegian authorities during 2004 and approval of the Vilje PDO, which was submitted to the Norwegian government in December 2004, is expected in 2005. Production from the Alvheim/Vilje developments is expected to begin in 2007. Reserve additions for the Corrib development totaled 16 million boe, or 12% of total extensions, discoveries and other additions. With the planning permission received from the Irish authorities for the proposed natural gas terminal, which is to be built to bring gas from the Corrib field ashore, development activities are underway. First gas production is expected in 2007. The Alba field in Equatorial Guinea had the most significant positive revisions 162 million boe. Of this volume, 84 million boe was added due to the final investment decision on the Equatorial Guinea LNG project, which will use the gas from the Alba field to produce LNG. Startup of the LNG plant is expected in 2007. An additional 66 million boe is related to additional compression that is expected to be installed in 2010 and will be necessary for the LNG plant to meet its requirements. At the end of 2004, our total proved reserves associated with the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea totaled 471 million boe, or 41 percent of our total proved reserves. We had negative revisions of 51 million boe in Russia and 40 million boe in the Powder River Basin due to disappointing results from development activity. These revisions, combined with extensions, discoveries and other additions and a small disposition, resulted in total net reductions in reserves of 46 million boe for Russia and 35 million boe for the Powder River Basin. The above estimated quantities of reserves, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, timing of production from development projects and timing of the LNG plant activities are forward looking statements, are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. With respect to additional factors that may affect the Alvheim/Vilje developments, the Corrib development and the LNG plant, please refer to page 6. For additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves" on pages F 45 through F 46. We filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") for the years 2003 and 2002 disclosing the year end estimated oil and gas reserves. We will file a similar report for 2004. The year end estimates reported to the DOE are the same as the estimates reported in the Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities. Delivery Commitments We have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements. In Alaska, we have two long term sales contracts with the local utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 181 bcf of natural gas over the remaining life of these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2016. In addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska LNG plant and a proportionate share of the long term LNG sales obligation to two Japanese utility companies. This obligation is estimated to total 110 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates March 31, 2009. These commitments are structured with variable pricing terms. Our production from various gas fields in the Cook Inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. Our proved reserves and estimated production rates in the Cook Inlet sufficiently meet these contractual obligations. 8  In the U.K., we have two long term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 210 bcf of natural gas through the remaining life of these contracts, which terminate in September 2009. Our Brae area production, together with natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, will supply the natural gas to service these contracts. Our Brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates sufficiently meet these contractual obligations. Pricing under these gas sales contracts is variable.

Oil and Gas Acreage The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage that we held as of December 31, 2004: Gross and Net Acreage Developed Undeveloped Developed and Undeveloped (Thousands of Acres) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net United States 1,825 764 2,320 1,426 4,145 2,190 Europe 395 305 1,315 602 1,710 907 West Africa 68 42 2,973 799 3,041 841 Other International 599 599 2,541 1,997 3,140 2,596 WORLDWIDE 2,887 1,710 9,149 4,824 12,036 6,534 11 Refining, Marketing and Transportation Our RM&T operations are primarily conducted by MAP and its subsidiaries, including its wholly owned subsidiaries, Speedway SuperAmerica LLC ("SSA") and Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC. Refining MAP owns and operates seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 948,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The table below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of each of MAPs refineries as of December 31, 2004: Crude Oil Refining Capacity (Barrels per Day) Garyville, LA 245,000 Catlettsburg, KY 222,000 Robinson, IL 192,000 Detroit, MI 74,000 Canton, OH 73,000 Texas City, TX 72,000 St. Paul Park, MN 70,000 TOTAL 948,000 MAPs refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated gasoline. MAPs refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available; gas oil may be moved from Robinson to Detroit where excess fluid catalytic cracking unit capacity is available; and light cycle oil may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available. MAP also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. MAP manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and refractory industries. Additionally, MAP manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene and slack wax. During 2004, MAPs refineries processed 939,000 bpd of crude oil and 171,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. The following table sets forth MAPs refinery production by product group for each of the last three years: Refined Product Yields (Thousands of Barrels per Day) 2004 2003 2002 Gasoline 608 567 581 Distillates 299 284 285 Propane 22 21 21 Feedstocks and Special Products 94 93 80 Heavy Fuel Oil 25 24 20 Asphalt 77 72 72 TOTAL 1,125 1,061 1,059 Planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each refinery. MAP completed major turnarounds at its Garyville, Catlettsburg and Canton refineries during 2004. MAP increased its overall crude oil refining capacity during 2004 from 935,000 bpd to 948,000 bpd after completing the planned turnaround and expansion project at the Garyville refinery. This expansion increased crude oil capacity at Garyville from 232,000 bpd to 245,000 bpd. 12 The Catlettsburg refinery multi year improvement project was completed during early 2004. At a cost of approximately $440 million, the project improves product yields and lowers overall refinery costs while making gasoline with less than 30 parts per million of sulfur, which allows MAP to meet Tier II gasoline regulations which became effective on January 1, 2004. MAP is constructing approximately $300 million in new capital projects for its 74,000 bpd Detroit, Michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marketing In 2004 MAPs refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 20.4 billion gallons (1,329,000 bpd). The wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and the Southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of MAPs refined product sales volumes in 2004, excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions. Approximately 52 percent of MAPs gasoline sales volumes and 92 percent of its distillate sales volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2004. Approximately 55 percent of MAPs propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the United States. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 16 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in Canada, Mexico, India and South America. MAP markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and the Southeast. The MAP customer base includes approximately 800 asphalt paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. The following table sets forth the volume of MAPs consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: Refined Product Sales (Thousands of Barrels per Day) 2004 2003 2002 Gasoline 807 776 773 Distillates 373 365 346 Propane 22 21 22 Feedstocks and Special Products 92 97 82 Heavy Fuel Oil 27 24 20 Asphalt 79 74 75 TOTAL 1,400 1,357 1,318 Matching Buy/Sell Volumes included in above 71 64 71 MAP sells reformulated gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. MAP also sells low vapor pressure gasoline in nine states. As of December 31, 2004, MAP supplied petroleum products to about 3,900 Marathon and Ashland branded retail outlets located primarily in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. Branded retail outlets are also located in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Alabama, and South Carolina. SSA sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company operated retail outlets. As of December 31, 2004, SSA had 1,669 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names "Speedway" and "SuperAmerica." SSAs revenues from the sale of non petroleum merchandise totaled $2.3 billion in 2004, compared with $2.2 billion in 2003. Profit levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. Pilot Travel Centers LLC ("PTC"), a joint venture with Pilot Corporation ("Pilot"), is the largest operator of travel centers in the United States with approximately 250 locations in 35 states at December 31, 2004. The travel centers 13 offer diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on premises brand name restaurants. Pilot and MAP each own a 50 percent interest in PTC. MAPs retail marketing strategy is focused on SSAs Midwest operations, additional growth of the Marathon brand, and continued growth for PTC. Supply and Transportation MAP obtains the crude oil it processes from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. In 2004, MAPs net purchases of U.S. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged 416,000 bpd, including a net 20,000 bpd from Marathon. In 2004, Canada was the source for 14 percent or 130,000 bpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources supplied 42 percent or 393,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by MAPs refineries, including approximately 245,000 bpd from the Middle East. This crude was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and traders. MAP operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. At December 31, 2004, MAP owned, leased, or had an ownership interest in approximately 2,860 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,850 miles of product trunk lines. At December 31, 2004 MAP had interests in the following pipelines: 100 percent ownership of Ohio River Pipe Line LLC, which owns the Cardinal Products Pipeline, a refined products pipeline extending from Kenova, West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio; 50 percent interest in Centennial Pipeline LLC, which owns a system connecting Gulf Coast refineries with the Midwest market; 47 percent interest in LOOP LLC ("LOOP"), which is the owner and operator of the only U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of Louisiana; 50 percent interest in LOCAP LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system; 37 percent interest in the Capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois; and 33 percent interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from Clearbrook, Minnesota to Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which is in the vicinity of MAPs St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery. MAPs 84 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains and Southeast. These facilities are supplied by a combination of pipelines, barges, rail cars and or trucks. MAPs marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. MAP also leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors, tank trailers and general service trucks. Marathon also has interests in two refined product pipelines which are not part of MAP: 17 percent interest in Explorer Pipeline Company, which is a light product pipeline system extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest; and 6 percent interest in Wolverine Pipe Line Company, a light product pipeline system extending from Chicago, Illinois to Toledo, Ohio. The above discussion of the RM&T segment includes forward looking statements concerning anticipated completion of the Detroit refinery capital projects. Some factors that could affect the Detroit projects include unforeseen problems arising from construction, regulatory approval constraints, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. 14 Integrated Gas Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefication and regasification operations, methanol operations, certain other gas processing facilities and pipeline operations, and marketing and transportation of natural gas. Also included are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects. Methanol We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Alba field. Methanol sales totaled 980,000 gross metric tons (441,000 net metric tons) in 2004. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S. Natural Gas Marketing and Transportation Activities In addition to the sale of our own natural gas production, we purchase gas from third party producers and marketers for resale. We own a 24 percent interest in Nautilus Pipeline Company, LLC and a 24 percent interest in Manta Ray Offshore Gathering Company, LLC, which are both Gulf of Mexico natural gas pipeline systems. Additionally, we own a 34 percent interest in the Neptune natural gas processing plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. The plant has the capacity to process 600 mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the Nautilus pipeline system. Alaska LNG We own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefication plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, the LNG has been sold under a long term contract with two of Japans largest utility companies. LNG deliveries totaled 62 gross bcf (24 net bcf) in 2004. Equatorial Guinea LNG Project During 2004, Marathon and its partner, Compania Nacional de Petroleos de Guinea Ecuatorial ("GEPetrol"), the National Oil Company of Equatorial Guinea, through Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited ("EGHoldings"), began construction of an LNG plant on Bioko Island that will deliver a contracted offtake of 3.4 million metric tons per year (approximately 460 mmcfd). This project will allow us to monetize our gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the plant will be purchased from the Alba field participants under a long term gas supply agreement. Construction of the plant continues to progress and startup is projected for late 2007. At the end of 2004, we held a 75 percent economic interest in EGHoldings, with GEPetrol holding the remaining 25 percent economic interest. In connection with the formation of EGHoldings, GEPetrol was given certain contractual rights with respect to the purchase and resale to a third party of a 13 percent interest in EGHoldings currently held by Marathon. These rights give GEPetrol the option to purchase this 13 percent interest and resell it to a third party. These rights specify that we will be reimbursed for our historical costs plus an additional specified rate of return, which escalates depending on the time period during which such purchase and resale occurs, and a right to share in additional proceeds above those amounts under certain circumstances of resale. If GEPetrols rights are not exercised within one year from date of project sanction, which was in June 2004, the rights expire. EGHoldings has signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement with a subsidiary of BG Group plc ("BGML") under which BGML would purchase the LNG plants production for a period of 17 years on an FOB Bioko Island basis with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. The LNG would be targeted primarily to a receiving terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where it would be regasified and delivered into the Gulf Coast natural gas pipeline grid. Elba Island LNG During 2004, we began delivering LNG cargoes as part of our Elba Island, Georgia LNG regasification terminal capacity rights agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we can supply up to 58 billion cubic feet of natural gas (as LNG) per year, for up to 22 years. Also during 2004, we signed an agreement with BP Energy Company ("BP") under which BP will supply us with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as LNG, for a minimum period of five years beginning in the second half of 2005. We will 15 take delivery of LNG at the Elba Island LNG regasification terminal with pricing linked to the Henry Hub index. This supply agreement with BP enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at Elba Island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded gas resources beyond the term of the BP contract. We continue to actively seek additional cargoes prior to the start of deliveries from BP. The above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the estimated construction and startup dates of a LNG liquefaction plant and related facilities. Factors that could affect the estimated construction and startup dates of the LNG plant and related facilities include, without limitation, unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Competition and Market Conditions Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and gas. Acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front end bonus payments or commitments to work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based on industry sources, we believe we currently rank eighth among U.S. based petroleum companies on the basis of 2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production. Marathon through MAP must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. MAP believes it ranks fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2004. MAP competes in four distinct markets wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution for the sale of refined products and believes it competes with about 40 companies in the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; 8 refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 220 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. We compete in the convenience store industry through SSAs retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. Some locations also have on premises brand name restaurants such as Subway. We also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in PTC. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. The Separation On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001 ("Reorganization Agreement"), Marathon completed the Separation, in which: its wholly owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded company; and USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation. As a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. Thomas J. Usher is the non executive chairman of the board of both companies, and, as of December 31, 2004, four of the ten remaining members of Marathons board of directors are also directors of United States Steel. 16 In connection with the Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of two of those agreements. Financial Matters Agreement Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all Marathons principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by Marathon: obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through 2033; sale leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steels Fairfield Works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012, subject to extensions; obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel; and certain other guarantees. The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for Marathons discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying Marathon an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. $2 million of the industrial revenue bonds are scheduled to mature in the period extending through December 31, 2009. Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. United States Steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of Marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations. The financial matters agreement also requires United States Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee Marathon provided with respect to all United States Steels obligations under a partnership agreement between United States Steel, as general partner, and General Electric Credit Corporation of Delaware and Southern Energy Clairton, LLC, as limited partners. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures. The financial matters agreement requires Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. The agreement also obligates Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations. United States Steels obligations to Marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steels accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent. Tax Sharing Agreement Marathon and United States Steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. Provisions of this agreement include the following: for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before December 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between Marathon and United States Steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the Separation; 17 no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after December 31, 2001; and provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the Separation ceasing to qualify as a tax free transaction and limitations on post Separation activities that might jeopardize the tax free status of the Separation. Under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the Separation: the taxes payable by each of the Marathon Group and the U.S. Steel Group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return; and the U.S. Steel Group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable. In accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the Separation, Marathon made a preliminary settlement with United States Steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended December 31, 2001 under the pre Separation tax sharing principles. The tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before December 31, 2001. In the tax sharing agreement, each of Marathon and United States Steel promised the other party that it: would not, before January 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, jeopardize the tax free status of the Separation; and would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from the Separation ceasing to qualify as tax free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction. The prescribed actions and transactions include: the liquidation of Marathon or United States Steel; and the sale by Marathon or United States Steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business. In case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability. Even if the Separation otherwise qualified for tax free treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Separation may become taxable to Marathon under section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either Marathon or United States Steel is acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Separation. For this purpose, a "50 percent or greater interest" means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. To minimize this risk, both Marathon and United States Steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the Separation to be treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code may apply. If an acquisition occurs that results in the Separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that acquisition transaction. Although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the Separation, each of Marathon and United States Steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the Separation, is jointly and severally liable under the Internal Revenue Code for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. To address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. Marathon can provide no assurance, however, that United States Steel will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to Marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement. 18  Obligations Associated with the Separation as of December 31, 2004 See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel" on page 42 for a discussion of Marathons obligations associated with the Separation. Environmental Matters We maintain a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors. Our Health, Environment and Safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Health, Environment and Safety Management Committee, which is comprised of our officers, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance programs. We also have an Emergency Management Team, composed of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving Marathon or any of our properties. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA 90") with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. These laws and their associated regulations are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on Marathon for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for Marathons acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" on page 44 and "Legal Proceedings" on page 21. Air Of particular significance to MAP are EPA regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. MAPs combined capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. Costs incurred through December 31, 2004 were approximately $520 million. Some factors that could potentially affect MAPs gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of project detailed engineering, construction and startup activities. The U.S. EPA has finalized new and revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for fine particulate emissions (PM2.5) and ozone. In connection with these new standards, EPA will designate certain areas as "nonattainment," meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment areas EPA has proposed a rule called the Interstate Air Quality Rule ("IAQR") that will require significant reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions in numerous states. All of our refinery operations are located in these affected states. If this rule is finalized, it could have a significant impact on our operations as well as the operations of many of our competitors. At this time, we cannot determine whether the IAQR will be finalized or whether it will be substantially changed before it is final. As a result, we cannot presently reasonably estimate the financial impact of such a rule. Water We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA 90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA 90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous 19 substances. Also, in case of such releases OPA 90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. Additionally, OPA 90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase out schedule. As of December 31, 2004, all of the barges used in MAPs river transportation operations meet the double hulled requirements of OPA 90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA 90, but with expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA 90. Solid Waste We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks ("USTs") containing regulated substances. Since the EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of RCRA and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance with this statute cannot be accurately estimated. In addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. Remediation We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been satisfied. Accruals for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. As a general rule, Marathon and Ashland retained responsibility for certain remediation costs arising out of the prior ownership and operation of businesses transferred to MAP. Such continuing responsibility, in certain situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements, which gradually diminish this responsibility over time. Properties The location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important physical properties of Marathon have been described previously. Except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. The plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. At the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. The properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim. The basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves" on pages F 45 through F 46. Property, Plant and Equipment Additions For property, plant and equipment additions, see "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity Capital Expenditures" on page 39. 20 Employees We had 25,804 active employees as of December 31, 2004, including 22,661 MAP employees. Of the total number of MAP employees, 16,413 were employees of Speedway SuperAmerica LLC, most of which were employed at retail marketing outlets. Certain hourly employees at the Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31, 2006. The same union represents certain hourly employees at the Texas City refinery under a labor agreement that expires on March 31, 2006. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2006 at the St. Paul Park refinery and January 31, 2007 at the Detroit refinery.

Legal Proceedings Marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are included below in this discussion. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. However, management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably. Natural Gas Royalty Litigation Marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and Indian lessees violated the False Claims Act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. The first case, U.S. ex rel Jack J. Grynberg v. Alaska Pipeline Co., et al. is primarily a gas measurement case, and the second case, U.S. ex rel Harrold E. Wright v. Agip Petroleum Co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. These cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages and interest total more than $25 billion. The Department of Justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including Marathon. The matters are in the discovery phase and Marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases. Powder River Basin Litigation The U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") completed a multi year review of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. The Agencys Record of Decision ("ROD") was signed on April 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane development. Plaintiff environmental and other groups filed four suits in May 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana against the BLM alleging the Agencys environmental impact review was not adequate. Plaintiffs seek a court order enjoining coal bed methane development on federal lands in the Powder River Basin until BLM conducts additional studies on the environmental impact. Marathon has been allowed to intervene as a party in all four of the cases. As the lawsuits to delay energy development in the Powder River Basin progress through the courts, BLM continues to process permits to drill under the ROD. In January 2004, the Court over protests of Plaintiffs, transferred to the District Court of Wyoming, portions of two of the cases dealing with the sufficiency of the environmental impact review as to lands in Wyoming. In May 2004, plaintiff environmental groups Environmental Defense et al, filed suit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") in Montana Federal District Court, alleging the agency did not adequately consider air 21 quality impacts of coal bed methane and oil and gas operations in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming when preparing its environmental impact statements. Plaintiffs request that BLM be ordered to cease issuing leases and permits for energy development, until additional analysis of predicted air impacts is conducted. Marathon and Pennaco Energy, Inc. have intervened in the litigation. Environmental Proceedings The following is a summary of proceedings involving Marathon that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 2004, under federal and state environmental laws. Except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, managements belief set forth in the first paragraph under Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" above takes such matters into account. Claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, Marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA. Projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. To the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward looking statements. At December 31, 2004, Marathon had been identified as a PRP at a total of six CERCLA waste sites. Based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with all but one of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000. Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $4 million. In addition, there is one site where Marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability. There are also 131 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to Marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 14 were associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland which has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation. Based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 25 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 53 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 19 sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million per site and 8 sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site. There are 11 sites with insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs. There is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near Muskegon, Michigan. During the next five years, Marathon anticipates spending less than $7 million at this site. Expenditures in 2004 were approximately $391,000, and expenditures in 2005 are expected to be $600,000 as technical evaluation continues, and could be as much as $3,900,000 if soil remediation is commenced in the second half of the year. Ongoing work at this site is subject to approval by the MDEQ, and a risk based closure strategy is being developed for approval by the MDEQ. MAP has had a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Attorney Generals Office since 2002 concerning MAPs self reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its Robinson, Illinois refinery. MAP has had periodic discussions with Illinois officials regarding this matter and more discussions may occur in 2005. 22 In July, 2002, Marathon received a Notice of Enforcement from the State of Texas for alleged excess air emissions from its Yates Gas Plant and production operations on its Kloh lease. A settlement of this matter was finalized in 2004, with Marathon and its co owners paying a civil penalty of $74,000 and the donation of land as a Supplemental Environmental Project in lieu of a further penalty of $74,000. Marathon is owner of a 38% interest in the facilities. In May, 2003, Marathon received a Consolidated Compliance Order & Notice or Potential Penalty from the State of Louisiana for alleged various air permit regulatory violations. This matter was settled for a civil penalty of $148,628 and awaits formal closure with the State. In August of 2004, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection ("WVDEP") submitted a draft consent order to MAP regarding MAPs handling of alleged hazardous waste generated from tank cleanings in the State of West Virginia. The proposed order seeks a civil penalty of $337,900. MAP has met with the WVDEP and discussions are ongoing in an attempt to resolve this matter. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders Not applicable.  PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The principal market on which the Companys common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange. The Companys common stock is also traded on the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange. Information concerning the high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in "Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" on page F 41. As of January 31, 2005, there were 58,340 registered holders of Marathon common stock. The Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on Marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of Marathon Oil Corporation, although it has no obligation under Delaware law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to do so. In determining its dividend policy with respect to Marathon common stock, the Board will rely on the financial statements of Marathon. Dividends on Marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of Marathon.
