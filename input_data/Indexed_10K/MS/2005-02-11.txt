Company Results. The Company recorded net income of $4,486 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.06 in fiscal 2004, both 18% increases from the prior year. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) rose 14% to $23.8 billion in fiscal 2004, and the return on average common equity was 16.8% compared with 16.5% in the prior year. Non interest expenses of $17.1 billion increased 13% from the prior year, primarily due to higher compensation expense and professional services expense associated with increased business activity and additional legal and regulatory costs. Compensation and benefits expense in fiscal 2004 reflected an additional year of amortization of equity based awards (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). The Companys effective tax rate was 28.5% in fiscal 2004 compared with 29.0% in fiscal 2003. The decrease reflected higher domestic tax credits and certain miscellaneous items, partially offset by higher tax rates applicable to non U.S. earnings (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). At fiscal year end, the Company had 53,284 employees worldwide, an increase of 4% from the prior year, reflecting the recovering global economy, increased business activity, and additional personnel associated with increased regulatory and compliance efforts that existed in fiscal 2004. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $0.27 quarterly dividend per common share, an 8% increase from the $0.25 per common share declared the previous quarter. Institutional Securities. The Companys Institutional Securities business recorded income from continuing operations before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes, dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption and discontinued operations of $4.1 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago. Net revenues rose 17% to $13.1 billion, driven by record revenues in fixed income and significant increases in advisory fees and equity underwriting revenues. Non interest expenses rose 19% to $9.0 billion, reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs, professional services and other expense categories associated with increased business activity. Advisory revenues rose 75% from last year to $1.2 billion, reflecting a significant increase in the Companys market share in completed merger and acquisition transactions from 19% to 25% and a 29% increase in industry wide completed merger and acquisition activity (according to Thomson Financial). Underwriting revenues rose 29% from last year to $1.9 billion with equity, high yield and securitized products driving the increase in revenues. Equity underwriting revenues rose 55% compared with the prior year. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were $5.6 billion, up 4% from a record performance in the prior year. The increase was driven by a record year in commodities and improved results in credit products. Commodities benefited from tight oil supplies, growing demand and global political instability that drove energy prices and volatilities higher. Credit products benefited from increased customer flows and favorable trading conditions. Revenues from interest rate and currency products declined slightly from last years record revenues, primarily due to lower revenues from cash and derivative products. Equity sales and trading revenues rose 13% from last year to $4.1 billion. Prime brokerage had a record year driven by robust growth in client asset balances. Revenues from equity cash products increased, reflecting higher market volumes, while revenues from equity derivatives increased modestly despite continued low levels of volatility. Individual Investor Group. The Individual Investor Group recorded pre tax income of $371 million, down 20% from the prior year, largely driven by higher non interest expenses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of accounting to recognize certain asset management and account fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period as compared with when billed. This change decreased net revenues by 32 Table of Contents $107 million, non interest expenses by $27 million and pre tax income by $80 million for both the full year and quarterly results (see Asset Management and Account Fees herein). Net revenues for fiscal 2004 were $4.6 billion, a 9% increase over a year ago, reflecting higher asset management, distribution and administration fees driven primarily by an increase in client assets in fee based accounts. Commission revenues also increased from the prior year due to higher equity market volumes. Total non interest expenses were $4.2 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago. The increase was driven by higher compensation expense and higher professional services expense, including sub advisory, consulting and legal costs. Total client assets increased to $602 billion, up 7% from the prior fiscal year end. In addition, client assets in fee based accounts increased 21% from the prior fiscal year end to $157 billion and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 26% from 23% a year ago. At fiscal year end, the number of global representatives was 10,962, a decline of 124 over the past year. Investment Management. Investment Management recorded pre tax income of $827 million, a 72% increase from last year. The increase reflected a 20% increase in net revenues to $2.7 billion driven by an increase in asset management fees and higher investment gains. Non interest expenses increased 7% from the prior year to $1.9 billion, largely due to higher compensation expense and an increase in professional services expense driven by higher consulting, sub advisory and legal costs. Assets under management at fiscal year end were $424 billion, up $67 billion, or 19% from a year ago as a result of both market appreciation and positive net flows. At fiscal year end, the percentage of the Companys fund assets performing in the top half of the Lipper rankings was 71% over one year, 75% over three years and 73% over five years. Performance for the one and three year time periods was significantly better than a year ago. Principal transaction investment gains for the year were $248 million, a $229 million increase from a year ago, with the largest gains associated with the Companys holdings in Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. and Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. Credit Services. Credit Services pre tax income was a record $1,272 million, an increase of 16% from last year. The increase in earnings on a managed basis was driven by a decline in the provision for loan losses, reflecting improved credit quality, which more than offset lower net interest income and merchant and cardmember fees. Non interest expenses were relatively flat from the prior year as higher marketing expenses were offset by lower compensation costs. The managed credit card net charge off rate decreased 60 basis points from a year ago to 6.00%, benefiting from the effect of the Companys credit quality and collection initiatives and an industry wide improvement in credit quality. The managed over 30 day delinquency rate decreased 142 basis points to 4.55% from a year ago, and the managed over 90 day delinquency rate was 64 basis points lower than a year ago at 2.18%. Managed credit card loans were $48.3 billion at year end, virtually unchanged from a year ago. On a managed basis, net interest income fell $246 million from a year ago to $4.4 billion, reflecting lower average credit card loan balances, partially offset by an increase in the interest rate spread. Merchant and cardmember fees decreased $136 million on a managed basis, largely as a result of lower late and overlimit fees. Fiscal 2005 Performance Priorities. One of the performance priorities of the Company in fiscal 2005 is to regain a premium return on equity as compared with its competitors by focusing on areas of business with strong potential for growth and leveraging the strengths and capabilities of the Companys business segments. Each of the Companys businesses segments will also focus on key initiatives in fiscal 2005. Institutional Securities will continue to focus on enhancing client relationships, maintaining or improving market share and increasing profitability through investing in growth markets and improving capital and risk efficiency. The Individual Investor Group will focus on generating revenue growth and gathering assets. One of the groups top priorities is margin improvement over the next two years. Investment Managements primary objective will be to improve operating leverage through revenue growth. Investment Management will focus on building key growth areas where it is currently underrepresented, including separately managed accounts, multi discipline accounts and alternative investment products; capturing 33 Table of Contents more flows, primarily as a result of improved fund performance and standings; and continuing to concentrate assets under the best performing managers. In fiscal 2005, Investment Management may experience slower growth in fee revenues due to fee reductions across certain products and because a large percentage of product sales in fiscal 2004 were in institutional fixed income and liquidity fund products, which generally generate lower fees than equity products. In addition, lower principal investment gains are expected going forward as the Company reduces its private equity business. Credit Services will continue to focus on growing both profitability and customer receivable balances and creating a competitive advantage with its proprietary network. The Company believes there is potential to capitalize on the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, rejecting an appeal by Visa and MasterCard in U.S. v. Visa/MasterCard, which allows financial institutions to issue credit and debit cards on the Discover Network. In January 2005, the Company announced that it had signed its first third party issuance with GE Consumer Finance to issue the Wal Mart Discover card on the Discover Network. In addition, the Company believes that its acquisition of PULSE EFT Association, Inc. (PULSE&reg;), which was completed in January 2005, will result in a leading electronic payments company offering a full range of products and services for financial institutions, consumers and merchants. Global Market and Economic Conditions in Fiscal 2004. Global economic growth was generally favorable for most of fiscal 2004, particularly driven by the U.S. and China. The level of activity in the global capital markets was also higher than in fiscal 2003. Significant investor uncertainty, however, persisted throughout the fiscal year due to concerns about the pace of economic growth, inflationary pressures, higher oil prices and higher levels of geopolitical risk. At the end of fiscal 2004, most global financial markets rallied in response to positive economic developments, primarily in the U.S. In the first half of fiscal 2004, the U.S. economy benefited from accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, supported by productivity gains. Corporate earnings were generally strong, and consumer confidence rose as the U.S. labor market strengthened due to job creation and a decline in unemployment. The second half of fiscal 2004 began with a mid year slowdown due, in part, to soaring energy prices, the expected pace of inflation and cautious business investment before regaining momentum at the end of fiscal 2004. Major equity market indices had a mixed year, declining mid year due to higher energy prices, concern over continued turmoil in Iraq and global geopolitical tension, which depressed market sentiment and activity. The equity markets rallied at the end of the year due to positive economic developments, a positive earnings outlook and the resolution of the U.S. presidential election. During fiscal 2004, the unemployment rate declined to 5.4%, its lowest level since September 2001. In response to indications of inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) raised both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate on four separate occasions by an aggregate of 1.00% during the fiscal year. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Fed raised both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate by an aggregate of 0.50%. In Europe, the recovery of economic activity continued despite consistently higher oil prices, which had a considerable impact on inflation rates. The recovery in Europe was led by productivity gains in France and Spain, while economic conditions in Germany and Italy were less robust. The European Central Bank (the ECB) left the benchmark interest rate unchanged during fiscal 2004 as the level of interest rates remained low by historical standards. The ECB remains concerned about the level of inflation and the strength of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar and its negative impact on demand for exports. In the U.K., the labor market continued to strengthen, and business investment continued to grow. There were, however, some indications of a slowdown in the housing market, while the growth in consumer spending moderated. During fiscal 2004, the Bank of England raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 1.00%. Japans economy demonstrated signs of recovery during the first half of fiscal 2004, primarily driven by higher exports, consumer spending and industrial production. In the second half of fiscal 2004, the increase in exports and production showed signs of abating, as a rising Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and higher oil prices 34 Table of Contents diminished demand for exports. In China, there were signs that its economic growth rate may have been slowing, though the pace of expansion nevertheless remained rapid. Economies elsewhere in Asia also generally improved. As fiscal 2005 began, global economic and market conditions continued to be generally favorable, including a strong level of announced merger and acquisition transactions. As fiscal 2005 progresses, investors will continue to be focused on a number of important developments, such as corporate earnings, inflation and interest rates, energy prices and geopolitical risks. Business Segments. The remainder of Results of Operations is presented on a business segment basis before discontinued operations. Substantially all of the operating revenues and operating expenses of the Company can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures. As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by Investment Management to the Individual Investor Group associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to Individual Investor Groups representatives. Income before taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations was $118 million, $121 million and $129 million in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period segment amounts to conform to the current years presentation. 35 Table of Contents INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 3,008 $ 2,096 $ 2,179 Principal transactions: Trading 5,007 5,541 2,837 Investments 269 63 42 Commissions 1,998 1,748 2,033 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 144 92 91 Interest and dividends 16,367 13,381 13,056 Other 392 283 396 Total revenues 27,185 23,204 20,634 Interest expense 14,122 11,993 11,515 Net revenues 13,063 11,211 9,119 Non interest expenses 8,966 7,566 6,464 Income from continuing operations before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes, dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption and discontinued operations 4,097 3,645 2,655 Losses from unconsolidated investees 328 279 77 Dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 45 154 87 Income before taxes and discontinued operations $ 3,724 $ 3,212 $ 2,491 Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues are derived from the underwriting of securities offerings and fees from advisory services. Investment banking revenues were as follows: Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions $ 1,156 $ 662 $ 961 Equity underwriting revenues 993 640 543 Fixed income underwriting revenues 859 794 675 Total investment banking revenues $ 3,008 $ 2,096 $ 2,179 Investment banking revenues increased 44% in fiscal 2004, primarily reflecting higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring and equity underwriting transactions. Higher revenues from fixed income underwriting transactions also contributed to the increase. In fiscal 2003, investment banking revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring activities, partially offset by higher revenues from fixed income and equity underwriting transactions. In fiscal 2004, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 75% to $1.2 billion, the first time advisory fees exceeded $1.0 billion since fiscal 2001. Conditions in the worldwide merger and acquisition markets rebounded throughout fiscal 2004, reflecting improved conditions in the global equity markets. There was $1.8 trillion of transaction activity announced during calendar year 2004 (according to Thomson Financial, data as of January 7, 2005) as compared with $1.2 trillion in calendar year 2003. During calendar year 2004, the total amount of the Companys announced merger and acquisition transaction volume was approximately $385 billion as compared with approximately $242 billion in the prior calendar year. The 59% increase primarily resulted from an increase in average transaction size and higher volumes as an improved global economy resulted in increased transaction activity. Industry wide completion volumes also rose by 29% vs. the prior calendar year period, while the Companys volume of completed transactions increased nearly 70%. 36 Table of Contents The Companys fiscal 2004 revenues from merger and acquisition transactions were derived from several sectors, including financial services, technology, media and telecommunications, manufacturing and healthcare. In fiscal 2003, conditions in the worldwide merger and acquisition markets were difficult throughout most of the year. Such conditions included weak corporate earnings as companies began the year focusing on cost reduction instead of business expansion. In addition, the depressed level of fiscal 2002 merger and acquisition announcements had a direct impact on completed volumes during fiscal 2003, resulting in reduced advisory revenues. These conditions improved during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, when the global economy demonstrated signs of recovery and the equity markets rallied. The worldwide market for equity underwriting transactions in fiscal 2004 improved significantly from fiscal 2003, while the volume of fixed income underwritings continued to remain steady throughout fiscal 2004. Equity underwriting revenues increased 55% in fiscal 2004, largely due to the resurgence of the initial public offerings market. The global equity markets experienced renewed investor demand for initial public offerings, particularly in the U.S., and the Companys participation in these transactions more than outpaced the industry wide increase in transaction volume. The Companys equity underwriting revenues reflected increases from the financial services, healthcare, media and telecommunications, and technology sectors. In fiscal 2003, equity underwriting revenues increased 18% from fiscal 2002. In the first half of fiscal 2003, equity underwriting revenues increased from relatively depressed levels, primarily led by a high level of convertible offerings. Rising equity markets contributed to a more favorable equity underwriting environment in the second half of fiscal 2003, with a significant increase in global transaction activity, particularly in the technology, financial services and utility sectors. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2004 and 18% in fiscal 2003, primarily reflecting favorable conditions in the global fixed income markets throughout both fiscal years. Although the Fed increased overnight interest rates in fiscal 2004, longer term interest rates remained at historically low levels. The attractive debt financing environment contributed to higher revenues as issuers continued to take advantage of low financing costs. The Companys revenues from global high yield and securitized fixed income transactions were higher in both periods. In fiscal 2003, issuers took advantage of the lowest interest rates in nearly 45 years and relatively tight credit spreads. Fiscal 2003 also reflected higher revenues from investment grade products as compared with the prior year. The backlog of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions and equity and fixed income underwriting transactions is subject to the risk that transactions may not be completed due to unforeseen economic and market conditions, adverse developments regarding one of the parties to the transaction, a failure to obtain required regulatory approval, or a decision on the part of the parties involved not to pursue a transaction at the current time. At the end of fiscal 2004, the backlog of equity and fixed income underwriting transactions was higher as compared with the end of the prior fiscal year, generally reflecting improved global market and economic conditions. Although the merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions backlog was slightly lower at the end of fiscal 2004 as compared with the end of fiscal 2003, the calendar year over year comparison improved during the month of December 2004, as a result of the Companys role advising on a number of significant transactions announced during the month. Sales and Trading Revenues. Sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transaction trading revenues, commissions and net interest revenues. In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views principal trading, commissions and net interest revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions in securities are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a trade, including any associated commissions, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions and other related expenses. The components of the Companys sales and trading revenues are described below: Principal Transactions. Principal transaction trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions. The Company also engages in proprietary trading activities for its own account. 37 Table of Contents Principal transaction trading revenues include changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in the Companys structured borrowings. Prior to fiscal 2004, such amounts were included in interest expense (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Principal transaction trading revenues included $54 million and $749 million that were previously recorded as decreases to interest expense in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. These reclassifications had no impact on net revenues. Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over the counter (OTC) equity securities and options. Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions. Total sales and trading revenues increased 7% in fiscal 2004 and 35% in fiscal 2003, reflecting higher equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues. Sales and trading revenues include the following: Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Equities $ 4,067 $ 3,591 $ 3,528 Fixed income(1) 5,555 5,356 3,245 (1) Amounts include interest rate and currency products, credit products and commodities. Amounts exclude aircraft financing and corporate lending activities. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 13% in fiscal 2004 driven by record revenues in the prime brokerage business and higher revenues from cash and derivative products. The prime brokerage business experienced significant growth in global customer balances, which resulted in record setting annual revenues. Revenues from equity cash products rose, in part, due to increased cash flows into U.S. equity mutual funds. Revenues from equity derivatives increased modestly despite low levels of equity market volatility. Commission revenues increased slightly despite intense competition and a continued shift toward electronic trading. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 2% in fiscal 2003, reflecting higher revenues from derivative products, certain proprietary trading activities and prime brokerage services, offset by lower revenues from cash products. Toward the end of fiscal 2003, equity sales and trading revenues benefited from rising market indices, increased cash flows into equity mutual funds and higher equity new issue volume. For the full fiscal year, however, U.S. market volumes and market volatility were generally lower as compared with fiscal 2002, and commission revenues were impacted by a shift toward electronic trading. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 4% to a record level in fiscal 2004 driven by higher revenues from commodities and credit products, partially offset by lower revenues from interest rate and currency products. Commodities revenues increased 20% to record levels, primarily associated with activities in the energy sector where tight oil supplies, growing demand and global political instability drove energy prices and volatilities higher. Credit product revenues, which increased 6%, reflected record revenues from securitized products as the Company benefited from increased securitization flows in commercial and residential whole loans and favorable trading conditions. Lower revenues from investment grade products partially offset the increase. Interest rate and currency product revenues decreased 7% from last years record levels due to lower revenues from cash and derivative products. In addition, in the second half of fiscal 2004, mixed U.S. economic data coupled with higher global energy prices and concerns about the strength of economic growth resulted in market conditions that the Company did not take advantage of, which adversely affected revenues from certain 38 Table of Contents interest rate products. These decreases were partially offset by record results in foreign exchange and emerging markets, reflecting higher levels of volatility and strong customer volume. In fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, 63% and 54% of fixed income sales and trading revenues were recorded in the first half of each respective fiscal year. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 65% in fiscal 2003, reflecting volatile markets, significant new issue activity and higher client transaction volumes. The increase in revenues was broad based and included higher revenues from the Companys credit product, interest rate and currency product, and commodities groups. Credit product revenues increased 67%, reflecting strong capital markets activity and higher revenues from residential and commercial mortgage loan securitization activities, investment grade corporate and global high yield fixed income securities. Interest rate and currency product revenues increased 39%, primarily reflecting a generally favorable trading environment, a sharp rise in interest rates in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, higher derivative volumes and increased interest rate volatility in both the U.S. and European markets. Higher revenues from currency products, primarily due to higher market volatility and a declining U.S. dollar, also contributed to the increase. Commodities revenues increased 168% to record levels. The increase was primarily associated with activities in the energy sector, reflecting higher levels of volatility in certain energy markets, higher customer flow activity and increased trading activity in support of client securitizations. In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues include the net interest expense associated with the Companys aircraft financing activities, as well as net revenues from corporate lending activities. In fiscal 2004, revenues from corporate lending activities increased by approximately $110 million, reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and improved conditions in the commercial lending market, partially offset by mark to market valuations associated with new loans made in fiscal 2004. Lower net interest expense associated with aircraft financing activities contributed to the increase in sales and trading revenues. In fiscal 2003, sales and trading revenues from corporate lending activities increased by approximately $170 million due to lower markdowns as compared with fiscal 2002, reflecting tighter credit spreads as conditions in the credit market improved. In addition, lower net interest expense associated with aircraft financing activities contributed to the increase in sales and trading revenues. Principal Transactions Investments. Principal transaction net investment revenue aggregating $269 million was recognized in fiscal 2004 as compared with $63 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily related to gains associated with the Companys real estate and principal investment activities. Fiscal 2004s results included a gain on the sale of an investment in TradeWeb, an electronic trading platform. Fiscal 2003s results primarily included gains on the Companys real estate investments, partially offset by losses in other principal investments. Financial instruments purchased in principal investment transactions generally are held for appreciation and are not readily marketable. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from asset management services, primarily fees associated with the Companys real estate fund investment activities. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 57% and 1% in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2004 was due to higher fees associated with real estate investment and advisory activities, primarily due to the acquisition of a majority of the U.S. real estate equity investment management business of Lend Lease Corporation in November 2003 (see Business Acquisitions and Asset Sales herein). Other. Other revenues consist primarily of net rental and other revenues associated with the Companys aircraft financing business, as well as revenues from providing benchmark indices and risk management analytics associated with Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc. (MSCI) and Barra, Inc. (Barra) (see Business Acquisitions and Asset Sales herein). 39 Table of Contents Other revenues increased 39% in fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to Barra, which was acquired on June 3, 2004. Other revenues decreased 29% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues from the Companys aircraft financing business, reflecting a decline in lease rates. The decrease also reflected the inclusion of a gain in fiscal 2002 (of which $53 million was allocated to the Institutional Securities segment) related to the Companys sale of an office tower. Conditions in the commercial aircraft industry were generally more favorable in fiscal 2004 as compared with the prior year. Operating lease rates from the Companys aircraft financing activities have shown improvement during the second half of fiscal 2004 for many aircraft types. At the end of the year, the number of the Companys aircraft that were off lease or not committed to a lease transaction had decreased significantly from the prior year. However, unanticipated events, including the sale of additional aircraft or impairment charges, could have an adverse impact on the results of the aircraft financing business. For additional information on the aircraft financing business, see Discontinued Operations herein. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 19% in fiscal 2004. Compensation and benefits expense increased 23% due to higher incentive based compensation resulting from higher net revenues and higher amortization expense related to equity based awards (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 12%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 16%, primarily due to higher rental costs, primarily in London. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 16%, primarily reflecting increased trading activity. Professional services expense increased 43%, primarily due to higher consulting costs including the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX 404) and the Consolidated Supervised Entities Rule (the CSE Rule) (see Regulatory Developments herein). Legal and employee recruitment costs increased due to higher business activity. There were also increased costs for outside legal counsel due to certain regulatory and litigation matters. Marketing and business development expense increased 24% due to higher travel and entertainment costs. Other expenses decreased 16%, primarily reflecting a lower aircraft impairment charge of $107 million in fiscal 2004 as compared with $271 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 also included a $17 million charge to adjust the carrying value of previously impaired aircraft to market value (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Other expenses also included approximately $25 million relating to Institutional Securities share of the costs associated with a failure to deliver certain prospectuses pursuant to regulatory requirements and a fine associated with a settlement with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the NYSE) relating to the prospectus delivery requirements, operational deficiencies, employee defalcations and other matters. In addition, other expenses included legal accruals of approximately $110 million related to the Parmalat Matter and IPO Allocation Matters (see Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3). Fiscal 2003s total non interest expenses increased 17%. Compensation and benefits expense increased 20%. Compensation and benefits expense included a $220 million net benefit related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This net benefit was composed of a $352 million benefit related to expensing equity based compensation awards over a longer service period, partially offset by a $132 million charge relating to expensing stock options based on the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal 2003 (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). Excluding this benefit, compensation and benefits expense increased 26%, primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, reflecting higher net revenues. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 13% from fiscal 2002. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 13%, primarily reflecting higher global securities trading volumes. Other expenses increased 111%, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with the Companys aircraft financing business, including a higher asset impairment charge of $271 million (as compared with $70 million in fiscal 2002) and higher aircraft repossession costs, as well as a $17 million charge to adjust the carrying value of previously impaired aircraft to market value (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). The increase in other expenses also reflected accruals of approximately $180 million for loss contingencies related to IPO Allocation Matters and the LVMH Litigation (see Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3). The increase in non interest expenses was partially offset by restructuring and other charges of $117 million that were recorded in fiscal 2002 (see Restructuring and Other Charges herein). 40 Table of Contents INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR GROUP INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 290 $ 305 $ 267 Principal transactions: Trading 518 651 642 Investments (5 ) 4 (42 ) Commissions 1,327 1,231 1,278 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,038 1,613 1,577 Interest and dividends 409 370 446 Other 194 217 294 Total revenues 4,771 4,391 4,462 Interest expense 156 149 194 Net revenues 4,615 4,242 4,268 Non interest expenses 4,244 3,778 4,148 Income before taxes $ 371 $ 464 $ 120 Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues are derived from the Individual Investor Groups distribution of equity and fixed income securities underwritten by the Institutional Securities business, as well as underwritings of Unit Investment Trust products. Investment banking revenues decreased 5% in fiscal 2004 and increased 14% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower revenues from fixed income underwriting transactions, partially offset by higher revenues from underwriting Unit Investment Trust products. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher revenues from equity underwriting transactions reflecting higher volumes and from the underwriting of Unit Investment Trust products. Principal Transactions. Principal transactions include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions. The Company maintains certain inventory positions primarily to facilitate customer transactions. Principal transaction trading revenues decreased 20% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower revenues from fixed income products, reflecting lower customer transaction activity in corporate, municipal and government fixed income securities. Principal transaction trading revenues increased 1% in fiscal 2003, reflecting higher revenues from fixed income products, partially offset by lower revenues from equity products. The increase in fixed income products reflected higher revenues from investment grade corporate fixed income securities, as individual investor activity increased. The decrease in revenues from equity products reflected the difficult conditions that existed in the equity markets during the first half of fiscal 2003. Principal transaction net investment losses aggregating $5 million were recorded in fiscal 2004 as compared with net gains of $4 million in fiscal 2003. Principal transaction net investment losses aggregating $42 million were recorded in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002s results primarily reflected the write down of an equity investment related to the Companys European individual securities business. Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commission revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2004 and decreased 4% in fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 reflected higher customer trading volumes as compared with fiscal 2003 due to improved equity market conditions. The decrease in fiscal 2003 was due to lower customer trading volumes as individual investor participation in the U.S. equity markets declined. 41 Table of Contents Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including customer margin loans and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions. Net interest revenues increased 14% in fiscal 2004 and decreased 12% in fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to higher net interest revenues from brokerage services provided to individual customers as a result of an increase in the level of margin loans. The decrease in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to lower net interest revenues as a result of a decrease in the level of margin loans, partially offset by a decline in interest expense due to a decrease in the Companys average cost of borrowings. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from individual investors electing a fee based pricing arrangement. Asset management, distribution and administration fees also include revenues from asset management services and fees for investment management services provided to segregated customer accounts pursuant to various contractual arrangements in connection with the Companys Investment Consulting Services (ICS) business. The Company receives fees for services it provides in distributing certain open ended mutual funds. These fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 26% in fiscal 2004 and increased 2% in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, an increase in client asset balances resulted in higher fees from investors electing fee based pricing arrangements, including separately managed and Morgan Stanley ChoiceSM accounts. The change in the method of accounting for certain asset management and account fees (see Asset Management and Account Fees herein) partially offset the increase in fiscal 2004 by $67 million. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to higher fees from investors electing fee based pricing arrangements, reflecting an increase in client assets toward the end of fiscal 2003. This increase was offset by lower fees from promoting and distributing mutual funds, reflecting a decrease in individual investors average mutual fund asset levels and a less favorable asset mix that generated lower fees. In fiscal 2004, client asset balances increased to $602 billion at November 30, 2004 from $565 billion at November 30, 2003. At November 30, 2002, client asset balances were $516 billion. The increase in client asset balances in both periods was primarily due to market appreciation, reflecting improvement in the global financial markets. Client assets in fee based accounts rose 21% to $157 billion at November 30, 2004 and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 26% from 23% in the prior year. Client assets in fee based accounts rose 21% to $130 billion at November 30, 2003 and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 23% from 21% in the prior year. Other. Other revenues primarily include customer account fees and other service fees. Other revenues decreased 11% in fiscal 2004 and 26% in fiscal 2003. The change in the method of accounting for certain asset management and account fees (see Asset Management and Account Fees herein) decreased other revenues by $40 million in fiscal 2004, which was partially offset by higher revenues from customer service and account fees. The decrease in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to approximately $100 million of proceeds received in connection with the sale of the Companys self directed online brokerage accounts (see Business Acquisitions and Asset Sales herein) in fiscal 2002. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from customer service and account fees. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, which increased 9%. The increase reflected higher incentive based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and higher amortization expense related to equity based awards (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). This increase was partially offset by a reduction in compensation expense of $27 million associated with the change in the method of accounting for certain asset management and account fees (see Asset Management and Account Fees herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 19%. Marketing and business development expense increased 20% due to an increase in advertising costs. Professional services expense increased 48%, largely due to higher sub advisory fees associated with increased asset and revenue growth, as well as higher consulting and legal fees 42 Table of Contents resulting from the implementation of SOX 404 and the CSE Rule and an increase in costs for outside legal counsel due to regulatory and litigation matters. Information processing and communications expense decreased 11% due to lower data processing costs. Other expenses increased 46%, primarily resulting from an increase in legal and regulatory expenses, including approximately $25 million relating to the Individual Investor Groups share of the costs associated with a failure to deliver certain prospectuses pursuant to regulatory requirements and a fine associated with a settlement with the NYSE relating to the prospectus delivery requirements, operational deficiencies, employee defalcations (including the Carlos Soto matter) and other matters (see Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3). Non interest expenses decreased 9% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was attributable to lower compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 7%, principally reflecting lower employment levels, as well as a net benefit of $28 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123. This net benefit was composed of a $55 million benefit related to expensing equity based compensation awards over a longer service period, partially offset by $27 million related to expensing stock options based on the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal 2003 (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses decreased 13%. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 12%, reflecting the results of the Companys initiative to consolidate its branch locations. Information processing and communications expense decreased 10%, reflecting lower data processing and telecommunications expenses. Marketing and business development expense decreased 30% due to lower advertising costs. Other expenses increased 7%. Litigation costs increased, reflecting higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to mutual fund regulatory settlements, coupled with a benefit in fiscal 2002 from the resolution of a mutual fund litigation matter. These increases were partially offset by costs recorded in fiscal 2002 associated with the sale of the Companys self directed online brokerage accounts (see Business Acquisitions and Asset Sales herein). The decrease in non interest expenses was also due to restructuring and other charges of $112 million in fiscal 2002 (see Restructuring and Other Charges herein). 43 Table of Contents INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 43 $ 39 $ 32 Principal transactions: Investments 248 19 (31 ) Commissions 27 18 17 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,390 2,177 2,435 Interest and dividends 8 14 Other 28 29 40 Total revenues 2,744 2,282 2,507 Interest expense 6 6 1 Net revenues 2,738 2,276 2,506 Non interest expenses 1,911 1,794 1,850 Income before taxes $ 827 $ 482 $ 656 Investment Banking. Investment Management generates investment banking revenues primarily from the underwriting of Unit Investment Trust products. Investment banking revenues increased 10% in fiscal 2004 and 22% in fiscal 2003. The increase in both periods was primarily due to a higher volume of Unit Investment Trust sales. Unit Investment Trust sales volume increased 28% to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2004 and increased 10% to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2003. Principal Transactions. Investment Management principal transaction revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on investments associated with the Companys private equity activities and net gains and losses on capital investments in certain of the Companys investment funds. Principal transaction net investment gains aggregating $248 million were recognized in fiscal 2004 as compared with gains of $19 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004s results were primarily related to net gains on certain investments in the Companys private equity portfolio, including Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. and Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. Fiscal 2003s results were primarily related to gains in the Companys private equity portfolio and reflected improved market conditions from the difficult market conditions that existed in fiscal 2002. Financial instruments purchased in principal investment transactions generally are held for appreciation and are not readily marketable. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. During fiscal 2004, a team of investment professionals from the private equity business established an independent private equity firm that will manage, through a long term sub advisory role, the Morgan Stanley Capital Partners (MSCP) funds. The Company will continue as general partner for the MSCP funds and retain its limited partner interests. The Company will operate its other existing principal and real estate investment vehicles (that are included in the Investment Management and Institutional Securities business segments) as before and will actively pursue additional principal investing opportunities for its clients. 44 Table of Contents Commissions. Investment Management primarily generates commission revenues from dealer and distribution concessions on sales of certain funds as well as certain allocated commission revenues. Commission revenues increased 50% in fiscal 2004 and 6% in fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 reflected an increase in commissionable sales of certain fund products. In fiscal 2003, the increase was associated with a higher sales volume of insurance products. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees primarily include revenues from the management and supervision of assets, including fees for distributing certain open ended mutual funds and management fees associated with the Companys private equity activities. These fees arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or quarterly assets for other vehicles. Investment Managements period end and average customer assets under management or supervision were as follows: At November 30, Average for 2004 2003(1) 2002(1) Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in billions) Assets under management or supervision by distribution channel: Retail $ 202 $ 193 $ 186 $ 199 $ 186 $ 197 Institutional 222 164 151 191 152 155 Total $ 424 $ 357 $ 337 $ 390 $ 338 $ 352 Assets under management or supervision by asset class: Equity $ 200 $ 167 $ 138 $ 185 $ 142 $ 150 Fixed income 114 111 118 114 116 119 Money market 83 60 64 68 63 67 Other(2) 27 19 17 23 17 16 Total $ 424 $ 357 $ 337 $ 390 $ 338 $ 352 (1) Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.

The increase in fiscal 2004 reflected higher fund management and administration fees associated with a 15% increase in average assets under management or supervision. The increase in revenues also reflected a more favorable average asset mix, including a greater percentage of equity assets under management, partially offset by an increase in institutional fixed income and liquidity fund products, which generate lower fees than equity products. In fiscal 2003, the decrease primarily reflected lower distribution, fund management, and administration and redemption fees resulting from lower average assets under management or supervision, a less favorable average asset mix and lower redemptions of certain open ended funds. Non Interest Expenses. Fiscal 2004s total non interest expenses increased 7%. Compensation and benefits expense increased 21%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and higher amortization expense related to equity based awards (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses were relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003. Professional services expense increased 45%, primarily reflecting an increase in sub advisory, legal and consulting fees, including costs associated with the establishment of the independent private equity firm that will manage the MSCP funds through a long term sub advisory role. Marketing and business development expense decreased 22%, primarily due to lower promotional costs. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 7%, reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open ended funds. Fiscal 2003s total non interest expenses decreased 3%. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 4%, principally reflecting a decrease in employment levels, as well as a net benefit of $12 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123. This net benefit was composed of a $24 million benefit related to expensing equity based compensation awards over a longer service period, partially offset by $12 million related to expensing stock options based on the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal 2003 (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses decreased 3% from fiscal 2002. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 10%, reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in the current year due to a decrease in past sales. Other expenses increased 126%, primarily due to legal accruals associated with mutual fund regulatory settlements in fiscal 2003. In addition, fiscal 2002s other expenses included the net benefit from certain legal matters, including the resolution of a mutual fund litigation matter. 46 Table of Contents CREDIT SERVICES INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Fees: Merchant and cardmember $ 1,318 $ 1,379 $ 1,420 Servicing 1,993 2,015 2,080 Other 17 15 30 Total non interest revenues 3,328 3,409 3,530 Interest revenue 1,893 2,091 2,413 Interest expense 662 806 1,050 Net interest income 1,231 1,285 1,363 Provision for consumer loan losses 925 1,267 1,336 Net credit income 306 18 27 Net revenues 3,634 3,427 3,557 Non interest expenses 2,362 2,334 2,379 Income before taxes $ 1,272 $ 1,093 $ 1,178 Merchant and Cardmember Fees. Merchant and cardmember fees include revenues from fees charged to merchants on credit card sales, as well as charges to cardmembers for late payment fees, overlimit fees, balance transfer fees, credit protection fees and cash advance fees, net of cardmember rewards. Cardmember rewards include various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus award program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based upon a cardmembers level and type of purchases. Merchant and cardmember fees decreased 4% in fiscal 2004 and 3% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in fiscal 2004 was due to lower late payment and overlimit fees and higher cardmember rewards, net of estimated future forfeitures, partially offset by higher balance transfer fees and merchant discount revenues. The decline in late payment and overlimit fees reflected fewer late fee occurrences and a decline in the number of accounts charged an overlimit fee, partially offset by lower charge offs of such fees. Late fee occurrences were lower primarily due to a decline during fiscal 2004 in the over 30 day delinquency rates. Overlimit fees declined due to fewer overlimit accounts and the Companys modification of its overlimit fee policies and procedures in response to industry wide regulatory guidance. The increase in net cardmember rewards reflected the impact of promotional programs and record sales volume. Balance transfer fees increased as a result of the Companys continued focus on improving balance transfer profitability. The increase in merchant discount revenue was due to record sales volume. The decrease in merchant and cardmember fees in fiscal 2003 was due to a decline in late payment fees and higher cardmember rewards, partially offset by higher merchant discount revenue. The decline in late payment fees reflected fewer late fee occurrences and higher charge offs of late payment fees. The increase in cardmember rewards reflected higher Cashback Bonus costs due to merchant partner programs and increased sales volume. The increase in merchant discount revenue was due to increased sales volume and an increase in the average merchant discount rate. Servicing Fees. Servicing fees are revenues derived from consumer loans that have been sold to investors through asset securitizations and mortgage whole loan sales. Cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized general purpose credit card loans and the interest yield generated by securitized mortgage loans are used to pay investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans and to pay the Company a fee for servicing the loans. Any excess cash flows remaining are paid to the Company. The servicing fees and excess net cash flows paid to the Company are reported as servicing fees in the consolidated statements 47 Table of Contents of income. The sale of general purpose credit card and mortgage loans through asset securitizations, therefore, has the effect of converting portions of net credit income and fee income to servicing fees. The table below presents the components of servicing fees: Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 Fiscal2002 (dollars in millions) Merchant and cardmember fees $ 652 $ 727 $ 690 Other revenue 33 94 50 Total non interest revenues 685 821 740 Interest revenue 3,910 4,174 4,061 Interest expense 730 802 887 Net interest income 3,180 3,372 3,174 Provision for consumer loan losses 1,872 2,178 1,834 Net credit income 1,308 1,194 1,340 Servicing fees $ 1,993 $ 2,015 $ 2,080 Servicing fees are affected by the level of securitized loans and mortgage whole loan sales, the spread between the net interest yield on the securitized loans and the yield paid to the investors, the rate of credit losses on securitized loans and the level of cardmember fees earned from securitized general purpose credit card loans. Servicing fees decreased 1% in fiscal 2004 and 3% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in fiscal 2004 reflected lower cardmember fees, net interest cash flows and other revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for consumer loan losses. Cardmember fees declined due to lower late payment and overlimit fees, partially offset by higher balance transfer fees and lower fee net charge offs. The decrease in net interest cash flows was largely attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. The decrease in the provision for consumer loan losses was attributable to a lower rate of net principal charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. In fiscal 2003, the decrease in servicing fees was due to higher credit losses associated with a higher level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a higher rate of net principal charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by higher net interest cash flows and cardmember fees on securitized general purpose credit card loans associated with a higher level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and higher other revenue. The Other revenue component of servicing fees includes net securitization gains and losses on general purpose credit card loans and mortgage loans, gains and losses on mortgage whole loan sales and net revenues from mortgage servicing rights on mortgage whole loan sales. The decrease in the Other revenue component of servicing fees in fiscal 2004 was attributable to lower levels of general purpose credit card and mortgage loan securitization transactions and higher net gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions, partially offset by higher gains associated with mortgage whole loan sales as compared with fiscal 2003. The increase in Other revenue in fiscal 2003 was attributable to higher levels of general purpose credit card and mortgage loan securitization transactions, offset, in part, by higher net gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions. The following table presents net proceeds received from consumer loan sales: Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 (dollars in millions) General purpose credit card asset securitizations $ 3,714 $ 5,666 Mortgage loan securitization transactions 1,191 Mortgage whole loan sales 3,876 4,007 Net proceeds from consumer loan sales $ 7,590 $ 10,864 48 Table of Contents The credit card asset securitization transactions completed in fiscal 2004 have expected maturities ranging from approximately three to seven years from the date of issuance. Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest revenue derived from consumer loans and short term investment assets and interest expense incurred to finance those loans and assets. Assets, consisting primarily of consumer loans, currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market indexed variable rates. The Company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates. Interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the Company as part of its interest rate risk management program. This program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Companys right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. Net interest income decreased 4% in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 due to a decline in interest revenue that was partially offset by lower interest expense. The decline in interest revenue was primarily due to a decrease in average general purpose credit card loans. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower level of average interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in the Companys average cost of borrowings. The Companys average cost of borrowings was 4.01% for fiscal 2004 as compared with 4.33% for fiscal 2003. The decline in the average cost of borrowings reflected the favorable impact of replacing certain maturing fixed rate debt with lower cost financing. Net interest income decreased 6% in fiscal 2003 from the prior year period, as a decline in interest revenue was partially offset by lower interest expense. The decline in interest revenue was due to a lower yield on general purpose credit card loans and a decrease in average general purpose credit card loans. The lower yield on general purpose credit card loans was primarily due to lower interest rates offered to new cardmembers and certain existing cardmembers and a higher level of net interest charge offs. The decrease in average general purpose credit card loans was primarily due to a higher level of securitized loans and higher payments by cardmembers, partially offset by record levels of sales volume. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the Companys average cost of borrowings and a lower level of average interest bearing liabilities. The Companys average cost of borrowings was 4.33% for fiscal 2003 as compared with 5.29% for fiscal 2002. The decline in the average cost of borrowings reflected the Feds aggressive easing of interest rates that began in fiscal 2001 and the favorable impact of replacing certain maturing fixed rate debt with lower cost financing, reflecting the lower interest rate environment in fiscal 2003. 49 Table of Contents The following tables present analyses of Credit Services average balance sheets and interest rates in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 and changes in net interest income during those fiscal years: Average Balance Sheet Analysis.

The Company believes that the adjustments made in fiscal 2004 comply with the guidance. However, bank regulators have broad discretion on the application of the guidance, and changes in such guidance or its application by the regulators could impact future levels of general purpose credit card loans and related interest and fee revenue and charge offs. Provision for Consumer Loan Losses. The provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the Company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses. In calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. The Company regularly performs a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. The Companys provision for consumer loan losses was $925 million and $1,267 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The Companys allowance for consumer loan losses was $943 million at November 30, 2004 and $1,002 million at November 30, 2003. The provision for consumer loan losses decreased 27% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower net principal charge offs resulting from an improvement in credit quality, including lower bankruptcy charge offs driven by a decline in U.S. personal bankruptcy filings. The decrease was also due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans. The Company reduced the allowance for consumer loan losses by approximately $60 51 Table of Contents million in fiscal 2004 due to improvement in credit quality, including lower delinquency rates and dollars. In fiscal 2003, the provision for consumer loan losses decreased 5%, primarily due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans. In response to unfavorable trends in U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings and relatively high unemployment levels, the Company recorded a provision for consumer loan losses that exceeded the amount of net consumer loans charged off by approximately $70 million in fiscal 2003. Delinquencies and Charge offs. General purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when interest or principal payments become 30 days past due. General purpose credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days past due, except in the case of bankruptcies, deceased cardmembers and fraudulent transactions, where loans are charged off earlier. Loan delinquencies and charge offs are affected by changes in economic conditions, account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors. In fiscal 2004, net principal charge off rates decreased in both the owned and managed portfolios as compared with fiscal 2003, reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality and a lower level of bankruptcy filings (see Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data herein). Delinquency rates in both the over 30 and over 90 day categories were lower in both the owned and managed portfolios at November 30, 2004 as compared with November 30, 2003, also reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company changed its policy related to deceased cardmember accounts to charge off 60 days after notification as compared with charging off 180 days past due. This change accelerated charge offs beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and increased charge offs in the second half of fiscal 2003. During the second half of fiscal 2002 and the first half of fiscal 2003, the Company changed its re age policy in response to industry wide regulatory guidelines. A re age is intended to assist delinquent cardmembers who have experienced financial difficulties by returning the account to current status. This change in the re age policy, along with the economic challenges as evidenced by high levels of unemployment and U.S. bankruptcy filings, resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cardmembers eligible for re age vs. comparable periods in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Companys re age volume decreased by approximately 40% from fiscal 2002. The reduction in re age volume was a contributing factor to the higher delinquencies and charge off levels experienced in fiscal 2003 as compared with fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, net principal charge off rates increased in the managed portfolio as compared with fiscal 2002, reflecting the impact of lower re age volume and the change in the Companys deceased cardmember policy discussed above (see Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data herein). In the U.S., high levels of unemployment, the seasoning of the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, a high level of bankruptcy filings and policy changes contributed to the higher net principal charge off rate in the managed portfolio during fiscal 2003. In addition, these conditions impacted the Companys delinquency rates in both the over 30 and over 90 day categories, which were higher in both the owned and managed portfolio at November 30, 2003 as compared with November 30, 2002. A lower level of general purpose credit card loan balances also negatively impacted delinquency and net principal charge off rates in fiscal 2003. The Companys future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above. Factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, the seasoning of the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and the rate and magnitude of changes in the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 1% in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 5% due to lower employee benefit costs, as well as lower salaries resulting from lower 52 Table of Contents employment levels due, in part, to workforce reductions conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 5%. Marketing and business development expense increased 20% due to increased marketing costs associated with account acquisition, merchant initiatives and advertising. Other expenses decreased 9%, primarily reflecting a decrease in certain operating expenses, including lower losses associated with cardmember fraud. Fiscal 2003s total non interest expenses decreased 2% from fiscal 2002. Compensation and benefits expense increased 6%, reflecting an increase in personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, as well as costs associated with workforce reductions conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These costs included a charge of $35 million (pre tax) associated with workforce reductions and facility consolidations that were conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The charge reflected several actions in response to slower industry growth and difficult consumer credit conditions and consisted of severance related costs of $29 million and space related and other costs of $6 million. The majority of these costs were paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses decreased 6%. Marketing and business development expense decreased 11% due to lower direct mail costs. Other expenses decreased 11%, primarily reflecting a decrease in certain operating expenses, including lower costs associated with cardmember fraud and merchant bankruptcies. Other Matters. On October 4, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Visa and MasterCard in U.S. v. Visa/MasterCard. The trial and appellate courts found that Visa and MasterCard rules and policies that prevented virtually all U.S. financial institutions from doing business with competing networks violated the antitrust laws. Now that these rules have been struck down as illegal, financial institutions (in addition to Discover Bank) will be able to issue credit and debit cards on the Discover Network. Following the Supreme Court decision, Credit Services filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York seeking damages for harm caused by the anti competitive rules. In January 2005, the Company announced that it had signed its first third party issuance with GE Consumer Finance to issue the Wal Mart Discover card on the Discover Network. On January 12, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of PULSE (see Business Acquisitions and Asset Sales herein). Seasonal Factors. The credit card lending activities of Credit Services are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing. Historically, a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter, followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter. Merchant fees, therefore, historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting higher sales activity in the month of December. Additionally, higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume. Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data. The Company analyzes its financial performance on both a managed loan basis and as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) (owned loan basis). Managed loan data assume that the Companys securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the Companys owned loans. The Company operates its Credit Services business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis. Accordingly, underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans. The Company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations. In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis, which provides a more meaningful comparison with industry competitors. 53 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of owned and managed average loan balances, interest yields and interest rate spreads for the periods indicated: Reconciliation of General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 AverageBalance InterestYield InterestRateSpread AverageBalance InterestYield InterestRateSpread AverageBalance InterestYield InterestRateSpread General Purpose Credit Card Loans: Owned $ 17,608 10.05 % 6.04 % $ 19,531 10.02 % 5.69 % $ 20,659 11.03 % 5.74 % Securitized 29,779 12.90 % 10.56 % 31,333 13.13 % 10.64 % 29,176 13.79 % 10.78 % Managed $ 47,387 11.84 % 8.92 % $ 50,864 11.93 % 8.77 % $ 49,835 12.64 % 8.71 % The following tables present a reconciliation of owned and managed general purpose credit card loans and delinquency and net charge off rates: Reconciliation of General Purpose Credit Card Loan Asset Quality Data (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Period EndLoans DelinquencyRates Period EndLoans DelinquencyRates Period EndLoans DelinquencyRates Over30Days Over90Days Over30Days Over90Days Over30Days Over90Days General Purpose Credit Card Loans: Owned $ 19,724 4.08 % 1.97 % $ 18,930 5.36 % 2.53 % $ 22,153 5.32 % 2.41 % Securitized 28,537 4.87 % 2.34 % 29,428 6.36 % 3.01 % 28,990 6.45 % 2.85 % Managed $ 48,261 4.55 % 2.18 % $ 48,358 5.97 % 2.82 % $ 51,143 5.96 % 2.66 % Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Net Principal Charge offs: Owned 5.53 % 6.05 % 6.06 % Securitized 6.28 % 6.95 % 6.29 % Managed 6.00 % 6.60 % 6.19 % Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Net Total Charge offs (inclusive of interest and fees): Owned 7.68 % 8.33 % 7.97 % Securitized 9.01 % 9.75 % 8.51 % Managed 8.51 % 9.20 % 8.28 % 54 Table of Contents Business Acquisitions and Asset Sales. On January 12, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of PULSE, an Automated Teller Machine/debit network currently serving banks, credit unions and savings institutions in the U.S. The Company believes that the combination of the PULSE and Discover Network will create a leading electronic payments company offering a full range of products and services for financial institutions, consumers and merchants. As of the date of acquisition, the results of PULSE will be included within the Credit Services business segment. On June 3, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Barra, a global leader in delivering risk management systems and services to managers of portfolio and firm wide investment risk. The Company believes that the combination of MSCI, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, and Barra created a leading global provider of benchmark indices and risk management analytics. Since the date of acquisition, the results of Barra have been included within the Institutional Securities business segment. The acquisition price was $41.00 per share in cash, or an aggregate consideration of approximately $800 million. The Company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets totaling $663 million in connection with the acquisition (see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements). In fiscal 2003, the Company acquired selected components of the U.S. real estate equity advisory businesses of Lend Lease Corporation, an Australia based company. The financial statement impact related to this acquisition, which is included in the Companys Institutional Securities segment, was not significant. In fiscal 2002, the Company sold its self directed online brokerage accounts to Bank of Montreals Harrisdirect. The Company recorded gross proceeds of approximately $100 million (included within Other revenues) and related costs of approximately $50 million (included within Non interest expenses) in the Individual Investor Group segment. In fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a pre tax gain of $73 million related to the sale of a 1 million square foot office tower in New York City. The pre tax gain is included within the Institutional Securities ($53 million), Individual Investor Group ($7 million) and Investment Management ($13 million) segments. The allocation was based upon occupancy levels originally planned for the building. Discontinued Operations. As described in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements, in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded a pre tax loss of $42 million in its Institutional Securities business related to the write down of certain aircraft that were subject to a probable sale and, accordingly, have been designated as held for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The revenues and expenses associated with these aircraft have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As of February 3, 2005, all of the aircraft referred to above were sold. The table below provides information regarding the pre tax loss on discontinued operations and the aircraft impairment charges that are included in these amounts (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Pre tax loss on discontinued operations $ 38 $ 38 $ 18 Aircraft impairment charges 2 16 4 The pre tax loss on discontinued operations for fiscal 2003 also included a $19 million charge to adjust the carrying value of previously impaired aircraft to market value (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company may sell additional aircraft from time to time. 55 Table of Contents Income Tax Examinations. The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the United Kingdom, and states in which the Company has significant business operations, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction; for example, the current IRS examination covers 1994 1998. Assuming current progress, the Company expects this IRS examination to be completed in fiscal 2005. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. The resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statement of income for a particular future period and on the Companys effective tax rate. Restructuring and Other Charges. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recognized restructuring and other charges of $235 million (pre tax). The charge reflected several actions that were intended to resize and refocus certain business areas in order to address the difficult conditions then existing in the global financial markets. Such conditions, including significantly lower levels of investment banking activity and decreased retail investor participation in the equity markets, had an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, particularly in its Institutional Securities and Individual Investor Group businesses. The fiscal 2002 charge consisted of space related costs of $162 million and severance related costs of $73 million. The space related costs were attributable to the closure or subletting of excess office space, primarily in the U.S. and the U.K., as well as the Companys decision to consolidate its Individual Investor Group branch locations. The majority of the space related costs consisted of rental charges and the write off of furniture, fixtures and other fixed assets at the affected office locations. The severance related costs were attributable to workforce reductions. The Company reduced the number of its employees by approximately 2,200 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, primarily in the Institutional Securities and Individual Investor Group businesses. The majority of the severance related costs consisted of severance payments provided to the affected individuals. At November 30, 2004, the remaining liability associated with these charges was approximately $75 million, which was included in Other liabilities and accrued expenses in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The liability will continue to be reduced as the leases on the office locations referred to above expire. Equity Based Compensation Program. Effective December 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, using the prospective adoption method (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company now records compensation expense based upon the fair value of stock based awards (both deferred stock and stock options). Prior to fiscal 2003, the Company accounted for its stock based awards under the intrinsic value approach in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the approach in APB 25 and the terms of the Companys plans in prior years, the Company recognized compensation expense for deferred stock awards in the year of grant; however, no compensation expense was generally recognized for stock option grants. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123, the Company is recognizing the fair value of equity based awards granted in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 over service periods of three and four years, including the year of grant. Prior to fiscal 2003, the service period for stock based awards was deemed to be the year of grant. The effect of expensing stock based awards over a longer period of service reduced compensation expense recorded for deferred stock awards by $438 million in fiscal 2003 as compared with fiscal 2002. In addition, in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123, the Company recorded compensation expense of $176 million based on the 56 Table of Contents fair value of stock options granted in fiscal 2003. The net impact of these revisions reduced the Companys compensation and benefits expense by $262 million in fiscal 2003 and increased net income by $177 million (or $0.16 per share) in fiscal 2003 as compared with fiscal 2002. As a result of amortizing the cost of equity based awards over their respective service periods (including the year of grant), fiscal 2004s compensation and benefits expense included the amortization of equity based awards granted in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003s compensation and benefits expense only included the amortization of equity based awards granted in fiscal 2003. The net amount of compensation and benefits expense recognized by the Company related to its equity based awards (deferred stock and stock options) was approximately $650 million in fiscal 2004 and approximately $285 million in fiscal 2003. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) made certain revisions to SFAS No. 123 that will impact the Companys compensation and benefits expense in fiscal 2005 and future periods (see New Accounting Developments Stock Based Compensation herein). Asset Management and Account Fees. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company was improperly recognizing certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid at the beginning of the relevant contract periods, which is when such fees were billed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of accounting for such fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period, generally quarterly or annually. As a result of the change, the Companys results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included an adjustment to reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid to representatives. The impact of this change reduced net revenues by $107 million, non interest expenses by $27 million and income before taxes by $80 million, at both the Company and the Individual Investor Group segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Such adjustment reduced net income by approximately $50 million and basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05. If the above referenced fees and expenses had been recognized over the relevant contract period in the past, pre tax income for the Company and the Individual Investor Group segment would have been lower by the following amounts: Decrease inPre tax Income (dollars inmillions) Quarter ended: February 28, 2002 $ (4.1 ) May 31, 2002 (3.7 ) August 31, 2002 (2.1 ) November 30, 2002 (0.8 ) Fiscal 2002 total (10.7 ) February 28, 2003 (5.2 ) May 31, 2003 (1.3 ) August 31, 2003 (4.2 ) November 30, 2003 (2.0 ) Fiscal 2003 total (12.7 ) February 29, 2004 (3.1 ) May 31, 2004 (2.6 ) August 31, 2004 (2.3 ) Investments in Unconsolidated Investees. The Company invests in unconsolidated investees that own synthetic fuel production plants. The Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting. The Companys share of the operating 57 Table of Contents losses generated by these investments is recorded within Losses from unconsolidated investees, and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded within the Companys Provision for income taxes. In fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the losses from unconsolidated investees were more than offset by the respective tax credits and tax benefits on the losses. The table below provides information regarding the losses from unconsolidated investees, tax credits and tax benefits on the losses: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Losses from unconsolidated investees $ 328 $ 279 $ 77 Tax credits 351 308 109 Tax benefits on losses 132 112 31 IRS field auditors are contesting the placed in service date of several synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of the Companys unconsolidated investees (the LLC). To qualify for the tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, the production facility must have been placed in service before July 1, 1998. The LLC is vigorously contesting the IRS proposed position. If the IRS ultimately prevails, it could have an adverse effect on the Companys tax liability or results of operations. The Company has recognized cumulative tax credits of approximately $110 million associated with the LLCs synthetic fuel facilities. Pension Plans. The Company made contributions of $120 million and $239 million to its defined benefit pension plans (U.S. and non U.S.) in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Company, in consultation with its independent actuaries, lowered its expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets (from 7.50% to 7.25%) for fiscal 2004 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The impact of this change was not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2004. The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions by considering the interaction of several factors. Such factors include the range of potential contributions (i.e., the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) minimum required contribution up to the maximum tax deductible amount), the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. At November 30, 2004, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the Companys pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Qualified Plan). For its non U.S. plans, the Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations. Liabilities for benefits payable under its unfunded supplementary plans (the Supplemental Plans) are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees occurs. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rate, which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, is used to measure the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and to calculate the service cost and interest cost. The assumed discount rate reflects the rates of return on available high quality fixed income investments that reflect the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. For its Qualified Plan, which comprised approximately 94% of the total assets of the Companys pension plans at November 30, 2004, the Company 58 Table of Contents estimates its discount rate based on both the absolute levels of and year to year changes in various high quality bond indices, including the Moodys Aa long term rate bond yield. The Company uses the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets. For its Qualified Plan, the Company annually reviews the expected long term return based on changes in the target investment mix and economic environment from the previous year. It then compares its initial estimate (and adjusts, if necessary) with a portfolio return calculator model (the Portfolio Model) that produces a range of expected returns for the portfolio. Return assumptions are forward looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns. The Portfolio Model begins with the current U.S. Treasury yield curve, recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields. Corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums, based on current market conditions, are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class. Expenses that are expected to be paid from the investment return are reflected in the Portfolio Model as a percentage of plan assets. This includes investment and transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets, added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds, as well as administrative expenses paid from the Qualified Plan. The Companys expected long term rate of return on assets for its Qualified Plan for fiscal 2004 was based on the following expected asset allocation: Target InvestmentMix Expected AnnualReturn(1) Domestic equity: Large capitalization 30 % 8.0 % Small capitalization 10 % 8.6 % International equity 15 % 8.5 % Fixed income: Intermediate government/corporate 22 % 4.1 % Long term government/corporate 23 % 5.5 % (1) These amounts do not include the impact of diversification on the overall expected portfolio return. For its Qualified Plan, expected returns are computed using a market related value of assets. For the market related value of assets, a smoothed actuarial value of assets is used, equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period. Investment income equal to the expected return on the prior years market related value of plan assets is recognized immediately. Any difference between the actual investment income (on a market value basis) and the expected return is recognized over a five year period in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. In addition, the market related value of assets must be no greater than 120% and no less than 80% of the market value of assets. The Company amortizes (as a component of pension expense) unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service (generally 11 to 18 years) of active participants in each plan to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. The loss amortization component of fiscal 2004 pension expense was approximately $38 million, and future amortization is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys pension expense. Insurance Recovery. On September 11, 2001, the U.S experienced terrorist attacks targeted against New York City and Washington, D.C. The attacks in New York resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center complex, where approximately 3,700 of the Companys employees were located, and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the U.S. Through the implementation of its business recovery plans, the Company relocated its displaced employees to other facilities. 59 Table of Contents The Company has recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks pertaining to write offs of leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the World Trade Center complex, employee relocation and certain other employee related expenditures, and other business recovery costs. The costs were offset by estimated insurance recoveries. The Company continues to be in negotiations with its insurance carriers related to the events of September 11, 2001. At the conclusion of these negotiations, the Company currently believes that the amounts it will recover under its insurance policies will be in excess of costs recognized for accounting purposes related to the terrorist attacks. As of November 30, 2004, the Company had not recorded a gain for the anticipated excess recovery. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. SOX 404 requires that the Company make an assertion as to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting beginning with its fiscal 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm must attest to managements assertion. In order to make its assertion, the Company was required to identify material financial and operational processes, document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls. See Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in Part I, Item 9A. The Company began preparing for its SOX 404 initiative prior to fiscal 2004. The Company formed a Project Management Office to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews, coordinate the process for these reviews, provide direction to the business and control groups involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The Company also formed a Steering Committee, comprised of senior personnel from its control groups, to set uniform guiding principles and policies, review the progress of the initiative, direct the efforts of the Project Management Office and update the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on an ongoing basis. The Company also retained an accounting firm other than its independent registered public accounting firm to assist in its compliance with SOX 404. The SOX 404 effort involved many of the Companys employees around the world, including participation by the business areas and control groups. The Company viewed this evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise it was an opportunity to assess critically the financial control environment and make it even stronger. The Company incurred initial costs associated with its SOX 404 initiative in fiscal 2004 and expects to incur costs in the future, particularly as it coordinates the SOX 404 evaluation with other regulatory requirements to review and evaluate the control environment. 60 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Fair Value. Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, which include cash and derivative products, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and gains and losses are reflected in principal trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The fair value of the Companys Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are generally based on observable market prices, observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for Financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded. Bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time. Ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time. A substantial percentage of the fair value of the Companys Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased is based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product (or a related product) may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment. The price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. Price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace, and the characteristics particular to the transaction. Products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency. By contrast, products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency. Even in normally active markets, the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation. Alternatively, in thinly quoted markets, the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation. The Companys cash products include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and instrumentalities, other sovereign debt obligations, corporate and other debt securities, corporate equity securities, exchange traded funds and physical commodities. The fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters. These products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value. Examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and instrumentalities, exchange traded corporate equity securities, most municipal debt securities, most corporate debt securities, most high yield debt securities, physical commodities, certain tradable loan products and most mortgage backed securities. In certain circumstances, principally involving loan products and other financial instruments held for securitization transactions, the Company determines fair value from within the range of bid and ask prices such 61 Table of Contents that fair value indicates the value likely to be realized in a current market transaction. Bid prices reflect the price that the Company and others pay, or stand ready to pay, to originators of such assets. Ask prices represent the prices that the Company and others require to sell such assets to the entities that acquire the financial instruments for purposes of completing the securitization transactions. Generally, the fair value of such acquired assets is based upon the bid price in the market for the instrument or similar instruments. In general, the loans and similar assets are valued at bid pricing levels until structuring of the related securitization is substantially complete and such that the value likely to be realized in a current transaction is consistent with the price that a securitization entity will pay to acquire the financial instruments. Factors affecting securitized value and investor demand relating specifically to loan products include, but are not limited to, loan type, underlying property type and geographic location, loan interest rate, loan to value ratios, debt service coverage ratio, investor demand and credit enhancement levels. In addition, some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency, and the determination of the fair value requires more judgment. Examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, certain tradable loan products, distressed debt securities (i.e., securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties, including bankruptcy or insolvency) and equity securities that are not publicly traded. Generally, the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product, which can include cash flow analysis, revenue or net income analysis, default recovery analysis (i.e., analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery) and other analyses applied consistently. The following table presents the valuation of the Companys cash products by level of price transparency (dollars in millions): At November 30, 2004 At November 30, 2003 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Observable market prices, parameters or derived from observable prices or parameters $ 145,975 $ 66,948 $ 147,228 $ 75,058 Reduced or no price transparency 9,725 827 9,942 148 Total $ 155,700 $ 67,775 $ 157,170 $ 75,206 The Companys derivative products include exchange traded and OTC derivatives. Exchange traded derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above. OTC derivatives, whose fair value is derived using pricing models, include a wide variety of instruments, such as interest rate swap and option contracts, foreign currency option contracts, credit and equity swap and option contracts, and commodity swap and option contracts. The following table presents the fair value of the Companys exchange traded and OTC derivative assets and liabilities (dollars in millions): At November 30, 2004 At November 30, 2003 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Exchange traded $ 2,754 $ 4,815 $ 2,306 $ 3,091 OTC 64,338 51,005 42,346 33,151 Total $ 67,092 $ 55,820 $ 44,652 $ 36,242 The fair value of OTC derivative contracts is derived primarily using pricing models, which may require multiple market input parameters. Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity. These adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based upon observable market data where available. In the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices 62 Table of Contents or parameters of other comparable current market transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, fair value is based on the transaction price. The Company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by OTC derivatives. Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed form analytic formulae, such as the Black Scholes option pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof, applied consistently. In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Company are widely accepted by the financial services industry. Pricing models take into account the contract terms, including the maturity, as well as market parameters such as interest rates, volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts. A substantial majority of OTC derivative products valued by the Company using pricing models fall into this category. Other derivative products, typically the newest and most complex products, will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the models market parameters. The Company manages its market exposure for OTC derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or other related financial instruments. The Companys trading divisions, the Financial Control Department and the Market Risk Department continuously monitor the price changes of the OTC derivatives in relation to the hedges. For a further discussion of the price transparency of the Companys OTC derivative products, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible. In the event that market prices or parameters are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial Control and Market Risk Departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more information regarding the Companys risk management practices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A. Transfers of Financial Assets. The Company engages in securitization activities in connection with certain of its businesses. Gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the Company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125, and other related pronouncements. The gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends, in part, on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale. 63 Table of Contents In connection with its Institutional Securities business, the Company engages in securitization transactions to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets. The Company recognizes any interests in the transferred assets and any liabilities incurred in securitization transactions in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Subsequently, changes in the fair value of such interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. In connection with its Credit Services business, the Company periodically sells consumer loans through asset securitizations and continues to service these loans. The present value of the future net servicing revenues that the Company estimates it will receive over the term of the securitized loans is recognized in income as the loans are securitized. A corresponding asset also is recorded and then amortized as a charge to income over the term of the securitized loans. The securitization gain or loss involves the Companys best estimates of key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, payment rates, forward yield curves and appropriate discount rates. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results. Allowance for Consumer Loan Losses. The allowance for consumer loan losses in the Companys Credit Services business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses. Provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy. In calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. The Company regularly performs a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. A provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses (see Credit Services Provision for Consumer Loan Losses herein). Aircraft under Operating Leases. The Companys aircraft portfolio consists of aircraft to be held and used and aircraft that are to be disposed of by sale (held for sale). Aircraft under operating leases that are to be held and used are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the aircraft asset, which is generally 25 years from the date of manufacture. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Companys aircraft that are to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the aircraft may not be recoverable. Under SFAS No. 144, the carrying value of an aircraft may not be recoverable if its projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value. If an aircrafts projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, the Company will recognize an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the aircraft. The fair value of the Companys impaired aircraft is based upon the average market appraisal values obtained from independent appraisal companies. Estimates of future cash flows associated with the aircraft assets as well as the appraisals of fair value are critical to the determination of whether an impairment exists and the amount of the impairment charge, if any (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Aircraft under operating leases that fulfill the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 144 are stated at the lower of carrying value (i.e., cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 64 Table of Contents charges) or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Depreciation expense is not recorded for aircraft that are classified as held for sale. The Company will recognize a charge for any initial or subsequent write down to fair value less estimated cost to sell (see Notes 18 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements). A gain would be recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized (for a write down to fair value less cost to sell). Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations. The Companys results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors. In addition, results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including political, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of capital; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates; currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; the availability and cost of credit; inflation; and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. In addition, there has been a heightened level of legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could increase costs, thereby affecting future results of operations. Such factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis. The Companys Institutional Securities business, particularly its involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, including derivatives, is subject to substantial positive and negative fluctuations due to a variety of factors that the Company cannot control or predict with great certainty, including variations in the fair value of securities and other financial products and the volatility and liquidity of global trading markets. Fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity, which, among other things, affects the size, number, and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from the Companys principal investments. Such factors also affect the level of individual investor participation in the financial markets, which impacts the results of the Individual Investor Group. The level of global market activity also could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and supervision and the way in which such capital is allocated among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which could cause fluctuations to occur in the Companys Investment Management business. In the Companys Credit Services business, changes in economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact the results of Credit Services. The Companys results of operations also may be materially affected by competitive factors. Included among the principal competitive factors affecting the Institutional Securities and Individual Investor Group businesses are the Companys reputation, the quality of its personnel, its products, services and advice, capital commitments, relative pricing and innovation. Competition in the Companys Investment Management business is affected by a number of factors, including the Companys reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, relative performance of investment products, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, distribution channels, and types and quality of services offered. In the Credit Services business, competition centers on merchant acceptance of credit and debit cards, account acquisition and customer utilization of credit and debit cards, all of which are impacted by the types of fees, interest rates and other features offered. The Company strives to increase market share in all of its businesses and evaluates the competitive position of its businesses by, among other things, monitoring various market share data. For example, in the Institutional Securities investment banking business, the Company monitors its market share in key areas such as announced and completed worldwide mergers and acquisitions, worldwide equity underwritings and worldwide debt underwritings. In the Institutional Securities sales and trading business, the Company monitors its market share via independent client surveys as well as its market share of global exchange and non exchange volumes. In the Individual Investor Group business, the Company monitors its market share of client assets and the number of representatives. In the 65 Table of Contents Investment Management business, the Company monitors its market share of assets under management or supervision and mutual fund flows among mutual fund managers. It also monitors the relative performance of its funds as determined by organizations such as Morningstar and Lipper. In the Credit Services business, the Company monitors its ranking in the number of merchant and cash access locations, the level of general purpose credit card loan balances outstanding, transaction volume and the credit quality of its loan portfolio. The Company competes with commercial banks, insurance companies, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and through the Internet. The Company competes with some of its competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis. Certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have been acquired by or merged into other firms. Such convergence could result in the Companys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. It is possible that competition may become even more intense as the Company continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence in certain areas. In addition, the Company has experienced competition for qualified employees. The Companys ability to sustain or improve its competitive position will substantially depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees while managing compensation costs. As a result of the above economic and competitive factors, net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter. The Company intends to manage its business for the long term and to mitigate the potential effects of market downturns by strengthening its competitive position in the global financial services industry through diversification of its revenue sources, enhancement of its global franchise, and management of costs and its capital structure. The Companys overall financial results will continue to be affected by its ability and success in addressing client goals; maintaining high levels of profitable business activities; emphasizing fee based products that are designed to generate a continuing stream of revenues; evaluating product pricing; managing risks, costs and its capital position; and maintaining its strong reputation and franchise. In addition, the complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present, among other things, technological, risk management and other infrastructure challenges that will require effective resource allocation in order for the Company to remain competitive. 66 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Companys senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. These committees, along with the Companys Treasury Department and other control groups, also assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure, thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the Companys liquidity and capital policies. For a description of the Companys other principal risks and how they are monitored and managed, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A. The Companys liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the Company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations when they come due without material, adverse franchise or business impact. The key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the Companys business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. The principal elements of the Companys liquidity framework are the cash capital policy, the liquidity reserve and stress testing through the contingency funding plan. Comprehensive financing guidelines (collateralized funding, long term funding strategy, surplus capacity, diversification, staggered maturities, committed credit facilities) support the Companys target liquidity profile. The Balance Sheet. The Company monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. Given the nature of the Companys market making and customer financing activities, the overall size of the balance sheet fluctuates from time to time. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing and managing its business. The Companys total assets increased to $775.4 billion at November 30, 2004 from $602.8 billion at November 30, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases in securities borrowed, securities purchased under agreements to resell, financial instruments owned (largely driven by derivative contracts), receivables from customers and cash and securities segregated under federal and other regulations. The increase in securities borrowed, securities purchased under agreements to resell and receivables from customers was largely due to growth in the Companys equity financing related activities. The increase in derivative contracts was associated with interest rate, currency, equity and commodity derivative products due to increased customer flow and market activity. Cash and securities segregated under federal and other regulations increased due to increased levels of customer activity. Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a companys overall liquidity and capital policies. The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends. The Company has adopted a definition of adjusted assets that excludes certain self funded assets considered to have minimal market, credit and or liquidity risk. These low risk assets generally are attributable to the Companys matched book and securities lending businesses. Adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), as revised. The adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets (as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs). In addition, the Company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities. These 67 Table of Contents characteristics include the long dated nature (final maturity at issuance of 30 years extendible at the Companys option by a further 19 years), the Companys ability to defer coupon interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters and the subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure. The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these securities. The following table sets forth the Companys total assets, adjusted assets and leverage ratios as of November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003 and for the average month end balances during fiscal 2004: Balance at Average Month EndBalance November 30,2004 November 30,2003 Fiscal 2004 (dollars in millions, except ratio data) Total assets $ 775,410 $ 602,843 $ 713,992 Less: Securities purchased under agreements to resell (123,041 ) (78,205 ) (98,485 ) Securities borrowed (208,349 ) (153,813 ) (191,767 ) Add: Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased 123,595 111,448 128,681 Less: Derivative contracts sold, not yet purchased (55,820 ) (36,242 ) (43,433 ) Subtotal 511,795 446,031 508,988 Less: Segregated customer cash and securities balances (26,534 ) (20,705 ) (25,596 ) Assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FIN 46, as revised (44,895 ) (35,217 ) (39,728 ) Goodwill and intangible assets (2,199 ) (1,523 ) (1,761 ) Adjusted assets $ 438,167 $ 388,586 $ 441,903 Shareholders equity $ 28,206 $ 24,867 $ 26,718 Junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts 2,897 2,810 2,877 Subtotal 31,103 27,677 29,595 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets (2,199 ) (1,523 ) (1,761 ) Tangible shareholders equity $ 28,904 $ 26,154 $ 27,834 Leverage ratio(1) 26.8 x 23.0 x 25.7 x Adjusted leverage ratio(2) 15.2 x 14.9 x 15.9 x (1) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders equity. (2) Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity. The Companys total capital consists of equity capital combined with long term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months), junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts, and Capital Units. At November 30, 2004, total capital was $110.8 billion, an increase of $28.0 billion from November 30, 2003. During the 12 months ended November 30, 2004, the Company issued senior notes aggregating $38.2 billion, including non U.S. dollar currency notes aggregating $8.3 billion. In connection with the note issuances, the Company has entered into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short term London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) trading levels. At November 30, 2004, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Companys public debt shelf registration statements) was approximately $121 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries). The weighted average maturity of the Companys long term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5.2 years at November 30, 2004. Subsequent to fiscal year end and through February 4, 2005, the Companys long term borrowings (net of repayments) increased by approximately $8.6 billion. Equity Capital Management Policies. The Companys senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and, therefore, pursues a strategy of ensuring that the Companys equity base 68 Table of Contents adequately reflects and provides protection from the economic risks inherent in its businesses. Capital is required for, among other things, the Companys inventories, underwritings, principal investments, consumer loans, bridge loans and other financings, and investments in fixed assets, including aircraft assets. The Company also considers return on common equity to be an important measure of its performance, in the context of both the particular business environment in which the Company is operating and its peer groups results. In this regard, the Company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total equity, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity. The Company uses an economic capital model to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support the risk of the Companys business activities and to ensure that the Company remains adequately capitalized. Economic capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of the market, regulators and rating agencies. The Company assigns economic capital to each business unit based primarily on regulatory capital usage and potential stress losses across various dimensions of market, credit, business and operational risks. Additional capital is assigned for goodwill, intangible assets, principal investment risk, and balance sheet usage as required to meet the Companys leverage ratio targets. The Companys framework for allocating economic capital is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business, provide business managers with tools for measuring and managing risk, and allow senior management to evaluate risk adjusted returns to facilitate resource allocation decisions. At November 30, 2004, the Companys equity capital (which includes shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts) was $31.1 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from November 30, 2003. The Company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to purchase, subject to market conditions and certain other factors, shares of common stock for capital management purposes. There were no repurchases made under the capital management authorization during fiscal 2004. The unused portion of this authorization at January 31, 2005 was approximately $600 million. The Company also has an ongoing repurchase authorization in connection with awards granted under its equity based compensation plans. During fiscal 2004, the Company purchased approximately $1,132 million of its common stock (approximately 23 million shares) through open market purchases at an average cost of $50.31 (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5). The Company currently anticipates that it will increase common stock repurchases pursuant to its equity anti dilution program and expects that these repurchases will be between 35 million and 80 million shares for fiscal 2005. The actual amount of repurchases will be subject to market conditions and certain other factors. The Board of Directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In December 2004, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share by 8% to $0.27. 69 Table of Contents Liquidity Management Policies. The primary goal of the Companys liquidity and funding activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments. Given the highly liquid nature of the Companys balance sheet, day to day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of stable collateralized financing. The Company has centralized management of credit sensitive unsecured funding sources in the Treasury Department. In order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability, the Company has designed a liquidity management framework. Liquidity ManagementFramework: Designed to: Contingency Funding Plan Ascertain the Companys ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the businesses. The contingency funding plan sets forth the process and the internal and external communication flows necessary to ensure effective management of the contingency event. Analytical processes exist to periodically evaluate and report the liquidity risk exposures of the organization under management defined scenarios. Cash Capital Ensure that the Company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its financial obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt. The Company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash capital (long term debt and equity capital) to finance illiquid assets and the portion of its securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment. Liquidity Reserve Maintain, at all times, a liquidity reserve composed of immediately available cash and cash equivalents and a pool of unencumbered securities that can be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity to the Company. The reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on day to day funding requirements and strategic liquidity targets. The liquidity reserve averaged approximately $28 billion during fiscal 2004. Contingency Funding Plan. The Companys Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year; (ii) maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance, and replacement with cash collateral; (iii) return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities; (iv) additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a ratings downgrade; (v) higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding; (vi) client cash withdrawals; (vii) drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; and (viii) discretionary unsecured debt buybacks. The Companys CFP is developed at the legal entity level in order to capture specific cash requirements and availability for the parent company and each of its major operating subsidiaries. The CFP assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be trapped at subsidiaries due to regulatory, legal or tax constraints. In addition, the CFP assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities. Bank subsidiaries that operate in a deposit protected environment are not expected to be impacted by a Company specific credit event and are expected to continue to provide reliable funding for assets held in these entities. These entities include Discover Bank, which primarily funds credit card receivables, and Morgan Stanley Bank, which funds senior loans and certain mortgage assets. Discover Bank also accesses the asset backed financing market for a significant portion of its funding requirements. 70 Table of Contents Cash Capital. The Company maintains a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include the parent companys equity and the non current portion of certain long term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following: (i) illiquid assets such as buildings, aircraft, equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and principal investments; (ii) a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment; i.e., stressed haircuts; and (iii) expected drawdowns on unfunded commitments. The Company seeks to maintain a surplus cash capital position. The Companys equity capital of $31.1 billion (including junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts), long term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months) of $79.6 billion and Capital Units of $66 million comprised the Companys total capital of $110.8 billion as of November 30, 2004, which substantially exceeded cash capital requirements. Liquidity Reserve. The Company seeks to maintain a target liquidity reserve which is sized to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets, including coverage of a significant portion of expected cash outflows over a short term horizon in a potential liquidity crisis. Prior to fiscal 2004, this liquidity reserve was held in the form of cash deposited with banks. Beginning in late fiscal 2004, this liquidity reserve was increased and separated into a cash component and a pool of unencumbered securities. The pool of unencumbered securities, against which funding can be raised, is managed on a global basis, and securities for the pool are chosen accordingly. The U.S. held component consists largely of U.S. government bonds and at November 30, 2004 totaled $10.0 billion. The non U.S. component consists of European government bonds and other high quality collateral. The Company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserve (cash and securities) is maintained enhances its ability to quickly and efficiently source funding in a stressed environment. The Companys funding requirements and target liquidity reserve may vary based on changes in the level and composition of its balance sheet, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors. Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of committed credit facilities serves to further diversify the Companys funding sources. The Company values committed credit as a secondary component of its liquidity management framework. The Company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs, including the issuance of commercial paper, which consists of two separate tranches: a U.S. dollar tranche with the Company as borrower and a Japanese yen tranche with Morgan Stanley Japan Limited (MSJL) as borrower and the Company as guarantor. Under this combined facility (the MS MSJL Facility), the banks are committed to provide up to $5.5 billion under the U.S. dollar tranche and 70 billion Japanese yen under the Japanese yen tranche. At November 30, 2004, the Company had a $12.0 billion surplus shareholders equity as compared with the MS MSJL Facilitys covenant requirement. The Company maintains a master collateral facility that enables Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (MS&Co.), one of the Companys U.S. broker dealer subsidiaries, to pledge certain collateral to secure loan arrangements, letters of credit and other financial accommodations (the MS&Co. Facility). As part of the MS&Co. Facility, MS&Co. also maintains a secured committed credit agreement with a group of banks that are parties to the master collateral facility under which such banks are committed to provide up to $1.8 billion. At November 30, 2004, MS&Co. had a $2.8 billion surplus consolidated stockholders equity and a $0.9 billion surplus Net Capital, each as defined in the MS&Co. Facility and as compared with the MS&Co. Facilitys covenant requirements. The Company also maintains a revolving credit facility that enables Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (MSIL), the Companys London based broker dealer subsidiary, to obtain committed funding from a syndicate 71 Table of Contents of banks (the MSIL Facility) by providing a broad range of collateral under repurchase agreements for a secured repo facility and a Company guarantee for an unsecured facility. The syndicate of banks is committed to provide up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion, available in six major currencies. At November 30, 2004, MSIL had a $1.7 billion surplus Shareholders Equity and a $2.0 billion surplus Financial Resources, each as defined in the MSIL Facility and as compared with the MSIL Facilitys covenant requirements. The Company anticipates that it may utilize the MS MSJL Facility, the MS&Co. Facility or the MSIL Facility (the Credit Facilities) for short term funding from time to time (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in any of its Credit Facilities will impair its ability to obtain funding under the Credit Facilities, to pay its current level of dividends, or to secure loan arrangements, letters of credit or other financial accommodations. At November 30, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under any of the Credit Facilities. The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain a series of committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs. These facilities are expected to be drawn from time to time to cover short term funding needs. The committed credit facilities demonstrate the diversity of lenders to the Company covering geographic regions, including North America, Europe and Asia. On a yearly basis, the Companys committed credit strategy is reviewed and approved by its senior management. This strategy takes the Companys total liquidity sources into consideration when determining the appropriate size and mix of committed credit. The Company, through one of its subsidiaries, maintains several funded committed credit facilities to support the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan business. Lenders to these facilities provided an aggregate of $10.7 billion in financing at November 30, 2004. Funding Management Policies. The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include the Companys equity capital; long term debt; repurchase agreements; U.S., Canadian, Euro, Japanese and Australian commercial paper; asset backed securitizations; letters of credit; unsecured bond borrowings; securities lending; buy/sell agreements; municipal reinvestments; promissory notes; master notes; and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. Repurchase agreement transactions, securities lending and a portion of the Companys bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and, therefore, provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the U.S., European and Asian markets, targeting global investors and currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The Companys bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers, purchase Federal Funds, issue short term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes. Interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings, brokered and other time deposits. Savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits from individual securities clients. Brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposits issued by the Companys bank subsidiaries. Other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposits. The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations that would result from an interruption in the availability of the Companys funding sources. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period. The Company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity. In addition, the Company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least 110% of its 72 Table of Contents outstanding short term unsecured borrowings. The Company also maintains committed credit facilities (described above) to support its ongoing borrowing programs. Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with stable collateralized borrowing, while the securitization market allows for the securitization of the credit card receivables arising from the Companys Credit Services business. The Companys goal is to maximize funding through less credit sensitive collateralized borrowings and asset securitizations in order to reduce reliance on unsecured financing. The Institutional Securities business emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. As part of this effort, the Institutional Securities business continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity. Similarly, Credit Services, through its use of the securitization market, reduces the need for other unsecured parent company financing. Unsecured Financing. The Company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories, consumer loans and illiquid assets. In general, securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding, floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate. Fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt. Both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt (in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the Companys Credit Services business) are used to finance the Companys consumer loan portfolio. Consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed. The Company uses derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management, reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company issues long term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its Cash Capital Policy. In addition to these needs, long term debt funding is employed to enhance the Companys liquidity position by reducing reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings). Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. The Company has a portfolio approach for managing the unsecured debt issued by the parent company. This approach gives the Company flexibility to manage the unsecured debt portfolio across maturities, currencies, investors, and regions, taking into account market capacity and pricing. Down lending to subsidiaries is managed to ensure that inter company borrowings mature before those of the parent company. Liquidity and funding policies recognize potential constraints on the Companys ability to transfer funds between regulated entities and the parent company. During fiscal 2004, the Companys long term financing strategy was driven, in part, by its continued focus on improved balance sheet strength (evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions), a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings. As a result, for fiscal 2004, $38.2 billion of unsecured debt was issued (excluding certain equity and credit linked products not considered to be a component of the Companys cash capital). Financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as well as international institutional and retail clients. Unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately $24 billion. 73 Table of Contents Credit Ratings. The Companys reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important. The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the Companys short term and long term credit ratings. Factors that are significant to the determination of the Companys credit ratings or otherwise affect the ability of the Company to raise short term and long term financing include its: level and volatility of earnings, relative positions in the markets in which it operates, geographic and product diversification, risk management policies, cash liquidity, capital structure, corporate lending credit risk, and legal and regulatory developments. A deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the Company, thereby increasing the cost to the Company in obtaining unsecured funding. In addition, the Companys debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business, the Company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors. At November 30, 2004, the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the Companys senior debt credit rating was approximately $860 million. Of this amount, $367 million (approximately 43%) relates to bilateral arrangements between the Company and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the other. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the Company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded. As of January 31, 2005, the Companys credit ratings were as follows: CommercialPaper SeniorDebt Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited R 1 (middle) AA (low) Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Moodys Investors Service P 1 Aa3 Rating and Investment Information, Inc. a 1+ AA Standard & Poors(1) A 1 A+ (1) On September 29, 2004, Standard & Poors placed the Companys senior debt ratings on Positive Outlook. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities and Credit Services businesses. Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes special purpose entities (SPE) primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the Companys Institutional Securities business were approximately $3.9 billion at November 30, 2004, the majority of which were related to residential mortgage loan, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys Institutional Securities securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial 74 Table of Contents statements. In addition, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities, the Companys arrangements with these entities and its adoption of FIN 46, as revised. The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Credit Services Activities. The asset securitization market is a significant source of funding for the Companys Credit Services business. By utilizing this market, the Company further diversifies its funding sources, realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the Companys other funding sources, including unsecured debt. The securitization transaction structures utilized for the Credit Services business are accounted for as sales; i.e., off balance sheet transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In connection with its credit card securitization program, the Company transfers credit card receivables, on a revolving basis, to the trusts, which issue asset backed securities that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed. This structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions, potentially resulting in the need for the Company to obtain alternative funding arrangements. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (economic early amortization). Economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows (which would occur if the coupon, contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables) and is driven primarily by the trusts credit card receivables performance (in particular, receivables yield, cardmember fees and credit losses incurred) as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities. In the event of an economic early amortization, receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trusts from the Company would instead continue to be recognized on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trusts would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities. These recognized receivables would require the Company to obtain alternative funding. Although the Company believes that the combination of factors that would result in an economic early amortization event is remote, the Company also believes its access to alternative funding sources would mitigate this potential liquidity risk. A group of banks is committed to provide up to $1.3 billion under a credit facility that supports the short term extendible asset backed certificate program issued by the Discover Card Master Trust I. Such credit facility was renewed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Guarantees. FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect of Indebtedness of Others, requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. FIN 45 defines guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index or the occurrence or non occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. FIN 45 also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. 75 Table of Contents The table below summarizes certain information regarding derivative contracts, financial guarantees to third parties, market value guarantees and liquidity facilities at November 30, 2004: Maximum Potential Payout/Notional CarryingAmount Collateral/Recourse Years to Maturity Type of Guarantee Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 Total (dollars in millions) Derivative contracts $ 473,598 $ 281,033 $ 294,873 $ 254,354 $ 1,303,858 $ 16,970 $ 120 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees 337 196 95 27 655 7 161 Market value guarantees 51 17 286 536 890 46 57 Liquidity facilities 922 889 176 1,987 See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information on indemnities, exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees, general partner guarantees, securitized asset guarantees, merchant chargeback guarantees and other guarantees. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments. In connection with its operating activities, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations, as well as commitments to fund certain fixed assets and other less liquid investments. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2004, include long term borrowings, operating leases and purchase obligations. The Companys future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations as of November 30, 2004 are summarized below: Payments due in: Fiscal2005 Fiscal2006 2007 Fiscal2008 2009 Thereafter Total (dollars in millions) Long term borrowings(1) $ 12,764 $ 33,283 $ 14,866 $ 34,373 $ 95,286 Operating leases(2) 500 870 698 2,209 4,277 Purchase obligations(3) 707 466 173 62 1,408 Total $ 13,971 $ 34,619 $ 15,737 $ 36,644 $ 100,971 (1) See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, advertising, sponsorship, business acquisitions, and computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2004 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Companys commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, principal investments and private equity activities, and lending and financing commitments as of November 30, 2004 are summarized below by period of expiration. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: Fiscal2005 Fiscal2006 2007 Fiscal2008 2009 Thereafter Total (dollars in millions) Letters of credit(2) $ 8,433 $ 85 $ $ $ 8,518 Principal investment and private equity activities 89 10 79 7 185 Investment grade lending commitments(3)(5) 6,281 3,536 7,943 1,229 18,989 Non investment grade lending commitments(3)(5) 240 550 336 283 1,409 Commitments for secured lending transactions(4) 7,273 673 136 176 8,258 Commitments to purchase mortgage loans(6) 5,957 5,957 Total(1) $ 28,273 $ 4,854 $ 8,494 $ 1,695 $ 43,316 76 Table of Contents (1) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) This amount represents the Companys outstanding letters of credit, which are primarily used to satisfy various collateral requirements. (3) The Companys investment grade and non investment grade lending commitments are made in connection with its corporate lending activities. See Less Liquid Assets Lending Activities herein. (4) This amount represents lending commitments extended by the Company to companies that are secured by assets of the borrower. Loans made under these arrangements typically are at variable rates and generally provide for over collateralization based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. (5) Credit ratings are determined by the Companys Institutional Credit Department using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or lower are considered non investment grade. (6) This amount represents the Companys forward purchase contracts involving mortgage loans. The table above does not include commitments to extend credit for consumer loans of approximately $259 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company guarantees the debt and or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. At November 30, 2004, the Company had commitments to enter into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements of approximately $75 billion and $60 billion, respectively. Less Liquid Assets. At November 30, 2004, certain assets of the Company, such as real property, equipment and leasehold improvements of $2.6 billion, aircraft assets of $3.9 billion, and goodwill and intangible assets of $2.2 billion, were illiquid. Certain equity investments made in connection with the Companys private equity and other principal investment activities, certain high yield debt securities, certain collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage related loan products, bridge financings, and certain senior secured loans and positions also are not highly liquid. At November 30, 2004, the Company had aggregate principal investments associated with its private equity and other principal investment activities (including direct investments and partnership interests) with a carrying value of approximately $910 million, of which approximately $300 million represented the Companys investments in its real estate funds. High Yield Instruments. In connection with the Companys fixed income securities activities, the Company underwrites, trades, invests and makes markets in non investment grade instruments (high yield instruments). For purposes of this discussion, high yield instruments are defined as fixed income, emerging market, preferred equity securities and distressed debt rated BB+ or lower (or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies) as well as non rated securities which, in the opinion of the Company, contain credit risks associated with non investment grade instruments. For purposes of this discussion, positions associated with the Companys credit derivatives business are not included because reporting gross market value exposures would not accurately reflect the risks associated with these positions due to the manner in which they are risk managed. High yield instruments generally involve greater risk than investment grade securities due to the lower credit ratings of the issuers, which typically have relatively high levels of indebtedness and, therefore, are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions. In addition, the market for high yield instruments can be characterized as having periods of higher volatility and reduced liquidity. The Company monitors total inventory positions and risk concentrations for high yield instruments in a manner consistent with the Companys market risk management policies and 77 Table of Contents control structure. The Company manages its aggregate and single issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives and other financial instruments. The Company records high yield instruments at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in the consolidated statements of income. The market value of the Companys high yield instruments owned and high yield instruments sold, not yet purchased are shown below: AtNovember 30,2004 AtNovember 30,2003 (dollars in billions) High yield instruments owned $ 7.2 $ 3.7 High yield instruments sold, not yet purchased 2.4 0.8 Lending Activities. In connection with certain of its Institutional business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. The borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade. These loans and commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated or traded by the Company. For further information on these activities, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A. Regulatory Developments. In April 2004, the SEC approved the CSE Rule that establishes a voluntary framework for comprehensive, group wide risk management procedures and consolidated supervision of certain financial services holding companies by the SEC. The framework is designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory requirements on U.S. securities firms resulting from the European Union (EU) Directive (2002/87/EC) concerning the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the EU. The CSE Rule also would allow MS&Co., one of the Companys U.S. broker dealers, to use an alternative method, based on mathematical models, to calculate net capital charges for market and derivatives related credit risk. Under the CSE Rule, the SEC will regulate the holding company and any unregulated affiliate of a registered broker dealer, including subjecting the holding company to capital requirements generally consistent with the standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). In December 2004, the Company applied to the SEC for permission to operate under the CSE Rule and expects to be approved in fiscal 2005. The Company continues to work with its regulators to understand and assess the impact of the CSE Rule and Basel II capital standards. The Company cannot fully predict the impact that these changes will have on its businesses; however, compliance with consolidated supervision and the imposition of revised capital standards are likely to impose additional costs and may affect capital raising and allocation decisions. Regulatory Capital Requirements. MS&Co. and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. (MSDWI) are registered broker dealers and registered futures commission merchants and, accordingly, are subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MSIL, a London based broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority, and MSJL, a Tokyo based broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Agency. MS&Co., MSDWI, MSIL and MSJL have consistently operated in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC insured financial institutions must maintain (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, 78 Table of Contents as defined, to average assets (leverage ratio), (b) 4% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio) and (c) 8% of total capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (total risk weighted capital ratio). At November 30, 2004, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio and total risk weighted capital ratio of each of the Companys FDIC insured financial institutions exceeded these regulatory minimums. Certain other U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to various securities, commodities and banking regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. These subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their local capital adequacy requirements. Morgan Stanley Derivative Products Inc., the Companys triple A rated derivative products subsidiary, maintains certain operating restrictions that have been reviewed by various rating agencies. Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature, and, therefore, not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets, upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. New Accounting Developments. Variable Interest Entities. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, which clarified the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties (variable interest entities). Variable interest entities (VIE) are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if they do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Under FIN 46, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs and may hold interests therein, including debt securities, interest only strip investments and derivative instruments that may be considered variable interests. Transactions associated with these entities include asset and mortgage backed securitizations and structured financings (including collateralized debt, bond or loan obligations and credit linked notes). The Company engages in these transactions principally to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets. The Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. For those entities deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities (as defined in SFAS No. 140), which includes the credit card asset securitization master trusts (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company does not consolidate the entity. 79 Table of Contents On February 1, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46 for VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and for VIEs in which the Company obtains an interest after January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date of FIN 46 for arrangements with VIEs existing prior to February 1, 2003 to fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision of FIN 46 (FIN 46R) to address certain technical corrections and implementation issues that have arisen. As of February 29, 2004, the Company adopted FIN 46 or FIN 46R for all of its variable interests. For these variable interests, the Company consolidated those VIEs (including financial asset backed securitization, mortgage backed securitization, collateral debt obligation, credit linked note, structured note, municipal bond trust, equity linked note and exchangeable trust entities) in which the Company was the primary beneficiary. In limited instances, the Company deconsolidated VIEs for which it was not the primary beneficiary as a result of the adoption of FIN 46R. This is further discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements with respect to the statutory trusts that had issued preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption. As of May 31, 2004, the Company adopted FIN 46R for those variable interests that were previously accounted for under FIN 46. The effect of adopting FIN 46 and FIN 46R as of February 29, 2004 and May 31, 2004 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), signed into law on October 22, 2004, provides for a special one time tax deduction, or dividend received deduction (DRD), of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a companys last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date. FSP 109 2 provides entities additional time to assess the effect of repatriating foreign earnings under the Act for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which typically requires the effect of a new tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment. The Company will elect, if applicable, to apply the DRD to qualifying dividends of foreign earnings repatriated in its fiscal year ending November 30, 2005. The Company is awaiting further clarifying guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department on certain provisions of the Act. Once this guidance is received, the Company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the Act during fiscal 2005. Under the limitations on the amount of dividends qualifying for the DRD of the Act, the maximum repatriation of the Companys foreign earnings that may qualify for the special one time DRD is approximately $4.0 billion. Therefore, the range of possible amounts of qualifying dividends of foreign earnings is between zero and approximately $4.0 billion. Because the evaluation is ongoing, it is not yet practical to estimate a range of possible income tax effects of potential repatriations. Stock Based Compensation. Effective December 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, using the prospective adoption method. The Company currently records compensation expense based upon the fair value of stock based awards (both deferred stock and stock options) in accordance with SFAS No. 123. Prior to fiscal 2003, the Company accounted for its stock based awards under the intrinsic value approach in accordance with APB 25 (see Equity Based Compensation Program herein and Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the intrinsic value method under APB 25 as an alternative method of accounting for stock based awards. SFAS No. 123R also revises the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarifies SFAS No. 123s guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods. In addition, SFAS No. 123R amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid, which is included within operating cash flows. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 123R for the interim period beginning September 1, 2005 using a modified version of prospective application or may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application. 80 Table of Contents The Company currently expects to early adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method with an effective date of December 1, 2004. The Companys past practice for recognizing compensation expense for equity based awards included the recognition of a portion of the award in the year of grant. Based upon the terms of the Companys equity based compensation program, the Company will no longer be able to recognize a portion of the award in the grant year under SFAS No. 123R. This will have the effect of reducing compensation expense in fiscal 2005. As a result, fiscal 2005 compensation expense will include the amortization of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 awards but will not include any amortization for fiscal 2005 awards. If SFAS No. 123R was not in effect, fiscal 2005s compensation expense would have included three years of amortization (i.e., for awards granted in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005). In addition, the fiscal 2005 awards, which will begin to be amortized in fiscal 2006, will be amortized over a shorter period (2 and 3 years) as compared with awards granted in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 (3 and 4 years). 81 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Risk Management. Risk Management Policy and Control Structure. Risk is an inherent part of the Companys business and activities. The extent to which the Company properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability. The Companys broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole. The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in the Companys business activities: market, credit, operational, legal, and liquidity and funding risk. Liquidity and funding risk is discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. The Companys currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The cornerstone of the Companys risk management philosophy is protection of the Companys franchise and reputation. Guardianship is based on three key principles: accountability, transparency and independent oversight. Given the importance of effective risk management to the Companys reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters. Risk management at the Company requires independent Company level oversight, accountability of the Companys business segments, constant communication, judgment, and knowledge of specialized products and markets. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segment level. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business, the Companys risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification. The nature of the Companys risks, coupled with this risk management philosophy, informs the Companys risk governance structure. The Companys risk governance structure includes the Firm Risk Committee and the Capital Committee, the Chief Administrative and Risk Officer, the Internal Audit Department, independent control groups and various risk control managers, committees and groups located within the business segments. The Firm Risk Committee, composed of the Companys most senior officers, oversees the Companys risk management structure. The Firm Risk Committees responsibilities include comprehensive oversight of the Companys risk management principles, procedures and limits, and monitoring of material financial, operational and franchise risks. The Firm Risk Committee is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee). The Capital Committee oversees alignment of the Companys resource allocation with strategic priorities. The Capital Committees responsibilities include: approving acquisitions and divestitures and making recommendations to the Board of Directors (when appropriate); directing capital to the business segments; approving technical capital recommendations; approving capital exceptions; and approving methodologies for capital allocation for the Company and the business segments. The Chief Administrative and Risk Officer, a member of the Firm Risk Committee, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of Company risk limits; reviews material market, credit, and liquidity and funding risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department periodically examines the Companys operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories. 82 Table of Contents The Market Risk, Credit, Financial Control, Treasury and Law Departments (collectively, the Company Control Groups), which are all independent of the Companys business units, assist senior management and the Firm Risk Committee in monitoring and controlling the Companys risk through a number of control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Companys risk management and monitoring systems and processes. Each business segment has a Risk Committee that is responsible for ensuring that the business segment, as applicable: adheres to established limits for market, credit and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the Firm Risk Committee; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures, and related controls. Each of the Companys business segments also has designated risk managers, committees and groups, including operations and information technology groups (collectively, Segment Control Groups and, together with the Company Control Groups, the Control Groups) to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment Risk Committee. The Control Groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the segments market and credit risk profile, sales practices, pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Control Groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review that is overseen by the business segment Risk Committees and ultimately by the Firm Risk Committee. The following is a discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (other than liquidity and funding risk). The discussion focuses on the Companys securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and consumer lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Companys market risk exposure generated by the Companys statistical analyses are forward looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below. Market Risk. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business where the substantial majority of the Companys Value at Risk (VaR) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading related market risk within the Individual Investor Group and Investment Management businesses. The Company also incurs non trading related market risk principally through its consumer lending activities within the Credit Services business. Sound market risk management is an integral part of the Companys culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent. The Control Groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Companys risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries 83 Table of Contents and maintains the Companys VaR system. A variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk. Market risk is monitored through various measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to, and discussed with, senior management. Sales and Trading and Related Activities. Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management. During fiscal 2004, the Company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities. The Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions. The Company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related derivatives. The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Companys aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management. Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management. The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Companys trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing VaR and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses. The Companys trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and the Market Risk Department. The Market Risk Department also conducts scenario analyses, which estimate the Companys revenue sensitivity to a set of specific, predefined market and geopolitical events. Value at Risk (VaR). The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR based risk measures to various levels of management. 84 Table of Contents VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. The Company estimates VaR using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors (market risk factors); and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. The Companys VaR model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Companys 99%/one day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 1%, or once in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. The Companys VaR model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and linear exposures to implied volatility risks. Market risks that are incorporated in the VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities. As a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors, the Companys VaR model uses Monte Carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products (i.e., corporate bonds and credit derivatives). The Companys VaR models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks; reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities; and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodologys limitations, which include the following: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. The Company is aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and control at the trading desk, division and Company levels. VaR for Fiscal 2004. The table below presents the Companys VaR for each of the Companys primary market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003, incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the Companys trading businesses. This measure of VaR incorporates most of the Companys trading related market risks. However, a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in VaR (e.g., certain credit default baskets), and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different VaR results from those produced using more precise measures. For example, risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a VaR context. Aggregate Trading and Non trading VaR also incorporates (a) the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and (b) public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the Company. Principal investments made by the Company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the VaR results reported below. As of November 30, 2004, the aggregate carrying value of such investments was approximately $400 million. 85 Table of Contents Since the VaR statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future revenues or financial performance or its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in 100 trading days. The table below presents VaR for each of the Companys primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003: Trading andNon trading Trading Table 1: 99% Aggregate VaR 99%/One Day VaRat November 30, 99%/One Day VaRat November 30, Primary Market Risk Category 2004 2003 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 71 $ 52 $ 53 $ 45 Equity price 42 32 38 30 Foreign exchange rate 10 7 10 7 Commodity price 27 22 27 22 Subtotal 150 113 128 104 Less diversification benefit(1) 56 50 48 46 Aggregate VaR $ 94 $ 63 $ 80 $ 58 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between Aggregate VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category. The Companys Aggregate Trading and Non trading VaR, and Aggregate Trading VaR at November 30, 2004 were $94 million and $80 million, respectively. The Company views average VaR over the fiscal year as more representative of trends in the business than VaR at any single point in time. Table 2 below, which presents the high, low and average 99%/one day Aggregate Trading VaR over the course of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, represents substantially all of the Companys trading activities. Certain market risks included in the year end Aggregate Trading and Non trading VaR discussed above are excluded from these measures (e.g., equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the Company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions). Average Aggregate Trading VaR for fiscal 2004 increased to $73 million from $55 million in fiscal 2003, reflecting an increase in all primary risk categories except foreign exchange. The increase in interest rate and credit spread VaR was predominantly driven by increased exposures to credit sensitive instruments (e.g., corporate debt securities) and to interest rate levels. The increase in equity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased directional exposure to global equity markets. The increase in commodity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased exposures to oil products. Table 2: 99% High/Low/Average Trading VaR Daily 99%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2004 Daily 99%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2003 Primary Market Risk Category High Low Average High Low Average (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 80 $ 39 $ 50 $ 54 $ 33 $ 43 Equity price 48 24 34 50 14 25 Foreign exchange rate 21 6 11 32 3 11 Commodity price 49 22 33 42 21 27 Aggregate Trading VaR $ 97 $ 55 $ 73 $ 73 $ 45 $ 55 86 Table of Contents VaR Statistics for Comparisons with Other Global Financial Services Firms VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because firms differ in the statistical assumptions they make when simulating changes in market factors as well as in the methods they use to approximate the portfolio revaluations under the simulations. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates for similar portfolios. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms. Table 3 below presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (99% vs. 95%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four years vs. one year) for market data upon which it bases its simulations: Table 3: Average 99% and 95% Trading VaR withFour Year/One Year Historical Time Series Average 99%/One Day VaR Average 95%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2004 for Fiscal 2004 Primary Market Risk Category Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 50 $ 57 $ 31 $ 36 Equity price 34 31 24 22 Foreign exchange rate 11 11 7 7 Commodity price 33 25 21 16 Aggregate Trading VaR $ 73 $ 72 $ 50 $ 49 In addition, if the Company were to report Trading VaR (using a four year historical time series) with respect to a 10 day holding period, the Companys 99% and 95% Average Aggregate Trading VaR for fiscal 2004 would have been $232 million and $159 million, respectively. 87 Table of Contents Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for 2004 As shown in Table 2 above, the Companys average 99%/one day Aggregate Trading VaR for fiscal 2004 was $73 million. Around this average, the Companys Aggregate Trading VaR varied from day to day. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 99%/one day Aggregate Trading VaR and illustrates that for more than 90% of fiscal 2004 trading days, Aggregate Trading VaR ranged between $60 million and $90 million. One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the Companys VaR model as a measure of the Companys potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra day trading, for a 99%/one day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the fiscal year is three, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than five times in a year, the accuracy of the VaR model could be questioned. Accordingly, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results. The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenue during fiscal 2004 for the Companys trading businesses (including net interest and commissions but excluding primary and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses). There were no days during fiscal 2004 in which the Company incurred daily trading losses in its trading businesses in excess of the 99%/one day Aggregate Trading VaR. 88 Table of Contents Consumer Lending and Related Activities. Interest Rate Risk and Management. In its consumer lending activities, the Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations, as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, long term borrowings, deposits and Federal Funds. The Companys interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Companys right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, the Company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve its objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing. Sensitivity Analysis Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. For its consumer lending activities, the Company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure, one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from its fiscal year end, the Company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. A portion of the Companys credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate, although the Company has the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate. Therefore, the Company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. The Company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into 89 Table of Contents consideration the required notice period and billing cycles. In addition, assets that have a market based index, such as the prime rate, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the Companys normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that have a market based index, such as the commercial paper or LIBOR rates, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of November 30, 2004, it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following 12 month period would be reduced by approximately $60 million. The comparable reduction of pre tax income for the 12 month period following November 30, 2003 was estimated to be approximately $55 million. The increase in the reduction in pre tax income at November 30, 2004 was due to a higher level of variable rate financing, as fixed financings matured. The increase is partially offset by a higher level of variable interest rate assets as compared with the prior year period. The hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next 12 month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the Company would respond to significant changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the analysis does not necessarily reflect the Companys expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur. Credit Risk. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower, counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations. The Company is exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in its businesses. The Company incurs significant, single name credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities business. This type of risk requires significant credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis. The Company incurs consumer portfolio credit risk in the Credit Services business primarily through cardholder receivables. Credit risk in a pool of credit card receivables is generally highly diversified, without significant individual exposures, and, accordingly, is managed on a portfolio and not a single name basis. The Company incurs individual consumer credit risk in the Individual Investor Group business through margin loans to individual investors and loans to small businesses, both of which are generally collateralized. The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed separately. The Institutional Credit Department (Institutional Credit) manages credit risk exposure for the Institutional Securities business. Institutional Credit is responsible for 90 Table of Contents ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure in the Individual Investor Group business is managed through various credit risk departments and committees. The Individual Investor Group Risk Management Department is responsible for monitoring, measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures, including margin loans and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions. Credit risk exposure in the Credit Services business is managed through the Credit Services Credit and Market Risk Committee, which is, in turn, supported by business line specific risk committees and the Credit Risk Management Department, which is responsible for the development, validation and implementation of credit policy criteria, for predictive models and for monitoring performance for both new and existing products and overseeing adherence to existing policies and limits. Institutional Securities Activities. Lending. In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. These loans and commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated or traded by the Company. The borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade. Credit risk with respect to loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement. Securitized Products. The Company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, corporate and operating company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value. Other. In addition to the activities performed by Institutional Credit, there are credit risks managed by various business areas within Institutional Securities. For example, certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits. Certain risk management activities for the Companys prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. Derivative Contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams, exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and warrants on equities typically have longer maturities. The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Companys exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities, or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Analyzing Credit Risk. Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, counterparty and portfolio levels. In order to help protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities, Institutional Credit ensures that all material lending and derivative transactions are prudently analyzed prior to approval, that the creditworthiness of 91 Table of Contents the Companys counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly, and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. Institutional Credit assigns obligor credit ratings to the Companys counterparties and borrowers. These credit ratings are intended to assess a counterpartys probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or below are considered non investment grade. Additionally, Institutional Credit assigns a facility rating to lending facilities. The facility rating incorporates the relative position of the particular obligation in the borrowers capital structure and relative recovery prospects. The Company has credit guidelines that limit potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties by type of business activity. Institutional Credit administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits. Risk Mitigation. The Company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments which may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign, or sub participate lending commitments and funded loans to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company may enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements may provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterpartys rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default. Credit Exposure Lending. At November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003, the aggregate value of investment grade loans and positions was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and the aggregate value of non investment grade loans and positions was $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003, the aggregate value of lending commitments outstanding was $20.4 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively. In connection with these business activities (which include funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges with a notional amount of $11.6 billion and $7.3 billion at November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2003, respectively, including both internal and external hedges utilized by the lending business.

(4) In lieu of making an individual assessment of the creditworthiness of unrated companies, the Company makes a determination that the collateral held with respect to such obligations is sufficient to cover a substantial portion of its exposure. In making this determination, the Company takes into account various factors, including legal uncertainties and market volatility. The following tables summarize the fair values of the Companys OTC derivative products recorded in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased by product category and maturity at November 30, 2004, including on a net basis, where applicable, reflecting the fair value of related collateral for financial instruments owned: OTC Derivative Products Financial Instruments Owned Years to Maturity Cross MaturityNetting(1) NetExposurePre collateral NetExposurePost collateral Product Type Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) Interest rate and currency swaps and options, credit derivatives and other fixed income securities contracts $ 5,136 $ 7,366 $ 8,424 $ 27,821 $ (10,676 ) $ 38,071 $ 18,934 Foreign exchange forward contracts and options 8,809 698 128 5 (125 ) 9,515 7,824 Equity securities contracts (including equity swaps, warrants and options) 1,610 917 533 1,236 (310 ) 3,986 956 Commodity forwards, options and swaps 5,655 6,201 1,248 1,506 (1,844 ) 12,766 9,025 Total $ 21,210 $ 15,182 $ 10,333 $ 30,568 $ (12,955 ) $ 64,338 $ 36,739 93 Table of Contents (1) Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories.

Instruments in each category can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in one or more non U.S. currencies. The fair values recorded in the above tables are determined by the Company using various pricing models. For a discussion of fair value as it affects the consolidated financial statements, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies, the structure of the transaction, including its maturity, is one of several important factors that may impact the price transparency. The impact of maturity on price transparency can differ significantly 94 Table of Contents among product categories. For example, single currency and multi currency interest rate derivative products involving highly standardized terms and the major currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar or the euro) will generally have greater price transparency from published external sources even in maturity ranges beyond 20 years. Credit derivatives with highly standardized terms and liquid underlying reference instruments can have price transparency from published external sources in a maturity ranging up to 10 years, while equity and foreign exchange derivative products with standardized terms in major currencies can have price transparency from published external sources within a two year maturity range. Commodity derivatives with standardized terms and delivery locations can have price transparency from published external sources within various maturity ranges up to 10 years, depending on the commodity. In most instances of limited price transparency based on published external sources, dealers in these markets, in their capacities as market makers and liquidity providers, provide price transparency beyond the above maturity ranges. Country Exposure. The Company monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual countries. Credit exposure to a country arises from the Companys lending activities and derivatives activities in a country. At November 30, 2004, less than 5% of the Companys total credit exposure (including loans, lending commitments and derivative contracts) was to emerging markets, and no one emerging market country accounted for more than 1% of the Companys total credit exposure. The Company defines emerging markets to include all countries that are not members of the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD), excluding the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands, and those OECD countries rated below A by Institutional Credit. These country credit ratings are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Industry Exposure. The Company also monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual industries. At November 30, 2004, the Companys material credit exposure (including loans, lending commitments and derivative contracts) was to financial institutions, sovereign related entities and the energy sector. Individual Investor Activities. Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of all margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, possible hedging strategies. Additionally, all transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. At November 30, 2004, there were approximately $6.8 billion of customer margin loans outstanding. In addition, the Individual Investor Group is engaged in commercial lending to small businesses (BusinesScapeSM) in the forms of revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and owner occupied commercial real estate mortgages. BusinesScape clients are required to submit a formal credit application, including the borrowers financial statements. Once the credit information is obtained, a comprehensive financial analysis is performed to determine proper structure, debt capacity, cash flow coverage to service debt, liquidity analysis and collateral analysis. In addition, financial reporting requirements and financial covenants are proposed and negotiated between the lender and the borrower. Consumer Lending Activities. With respect to its consumer lending activities, potential credit cardholders undergo credit reviews by the Credit Department of Discover Financial Services to establish that they meet standards of ability and willingness to pay. Credit card applications are evaluated using scoring models (statistical evaluation models) based on information obtained from applicants and credit bureaus. The Companys credit scoring systems include both industry and customized models using the Companys criteria and historical data. Each cardmembers credit line is reviewed at least annually, and actions resulting from such review may include raising or lowering a cardmembers credit line or closing the account. In addition, the Company, on a portfolio basis, performs periodic monitoring and review of consumer behavior and risk profiles. The Company 95 Table of Contents also reviews the creditworthiness of prospective Discover Network merchants and conducts annual reviews of merchants, with the greatest scrutiny given to merchants with substantial sales volume. With respect to first mortgages and home equity lines of credit (mortgage lending), a credit process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting policies, together with industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., FICO scores). The Companys underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all loans pass a capacity, willingness and collateral value model that, in addition to a FICO score, includes debt ratios, loan to collateral value ratios, and independent third party appraisal/valuations and ownership reports. As part of the mortgage lending business strategy, almost all loans are sold in the secondary market through securitizations and home loan sales. These sales and securitizations pass the risk of credit loss onto the purchaser/investor. For further information on the Companys consumer loans, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Operational Risk. Operational risk refers to the risk that inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel resources and or systems will result in losses to the business. Operational risk also refers to the risk that external events, such as external changes, failures or frauds, will result in losses to the business. The Company performs the functions required to operate its different businesses either by itself or through agreements with third parties. The Company relies on the ability of its employees, its internal systems and systems at technology centers operated by third parties to process high numbers of transactions. These transactions may cross multiple markets and involve different currencies. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of the Companys or third partys systems or improper action by third parties or employees, the Company could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation. In light of the pervasiveness of operational risk and the diversity and complexity of that risk as experienced by the individual business segments, Control Groups and other supporting functions, the Company manages operational risk through a combination of line management and Company wide oversight responsibilities. As part of the Companys line management structure for operational risk, each business segment has a designated Operational Risk Manager. In addition, business segment risk committees review operational risk matters and or reports on a regular basis. Each Control Group and supporting function also has a designated Operational Risk Coordinator and a regular forum for discussing operational risk matters and or reports with senior management within the area. The Company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, the Companys securities businesses have procedures that require: that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the Companys books and that records are confirmed on a timely basis; that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures; and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances. With respect to its investment management activities, the Company manages operational risk related to its various data processing systems through, among other things, internal controls such as reconciliations and various backup procedures. With respect to its consumer lending activities, the Company manages operational risk through its system of internal controls that provides checks and balances to ensure that transactions and other account related activity (e.g., new account solicitation, transaction authorization and processing, billing and collection of delinquent accounts) are properly approved, processed, recorded and reconciled. The Company also uses periodic self assessments and Internal Audit reviews as a further check on operational risk. As new products and business activities are developed and as processes are designed and modified, operational risks are identified and control requirements are defined to mitigate the identified risks. These controls include the following range of risk categories: (i) internal fraud; (ii) external fraud; (iii) employment practices and workplace safety; (iv) clients, products and business practices; (v) damage to physical assets; (vi) business disruptions and system failures; and (vii) execution, delivery and process management. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a Company wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of the Companys disaster 96 Table of Contents recovery plans include: crisis management; data and applications recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis and training. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computer and other assets from unauthorized access. Through organizations promoting information security, such as the Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center and various other resources focused on information security, the Company continues to enhance its ability to detect and defend against cyber threats. The Company also utilizes the services of various external vendors that provide services in connection with the Companys ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of means, including service level and other contractual agreements, service and quality reviews, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the future. Legal Risk. Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Law Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Companys policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, collection activities, money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company. 97 Table of Contents [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] 98 Table of Contents
