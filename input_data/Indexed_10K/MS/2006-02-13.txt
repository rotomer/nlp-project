Economic capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators, rating agencies and the market. The Companys methodology is based on an approach that assigns economic capital to each segment based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses, goodwill and principal investment risk. The economic capital model and allocation methodology may be enhanced over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment. Capital data for fiscal 2003 have not been provided. The effective tax rates used in the computation of segment return on average common equity were determined on a separate entity basis. (5) Pro forma return on average monthly common equity from continuing operations is computed assuming a $1.5 billion equity allocation for the Companys aircraft leasing business for all monthly periods through July 2005 and $0.4 billion for all monthly periods from August 2005 through November 2005. The decrease in equity allocated to this business primarily reflected the decrease in asset value as a result of a $0.5 billion pre tax charge for discontinued operations (see Discontinued Operations herein). The Company views the pro forma return on average common equity as a relevant indicator of its operating performance for period to period comparisons as well as when comparing its operating results with other financial services firms. (6) Amounts include assets under management or supervision associated with the Retail Brokerage business. (7) Revenues and expenses associated with these assets are included in the Companys Asset Management, Retail Brokerage and Institutional Securities segments.

Company Results. The Company recorded net income of $4,939 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.57 in fiscal 2005, an increase of 10% and 13%, respectively, from the prior year. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) rose 13% to $26.8 billion in fiscal 2005, and the return on average common equity was 17.3% compared with 16.8% in the prior year. Income from continuing operations was $5,192 million for the year, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.81 compared with $4.15 last year. Non interest expenses of $19.4 billion increased 15% from the prior year, primarily due to higher compensation expense and professional services expense associated with increased business activity and legal and consulting costs. Compensation and benefits expense in fiscal 2005 reflected higher compensation accruals associated with a higher level of net revenues, as well as charges for senior management severance and new hires of approximately $311 million (see Senior Management Compensation Charges herein). Other expenses included charges for certain legal matters, including those associated with the Coleman Litigation and the Parmalat settlement, as well as charges related to certain legal and regulatory matters in the Retail Brokerage business. The Companys effective income tax rate was 26.5% in fiscal 2005 compared with 28.8% in fiscal 2004. The decrease reflected an income tax benefit of $309 million resulting from the Companys repatriation of approximately $4.0 billion of qualifying foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the American Jobs Creation Act) (see American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 herein). Excluding the impact of dividends repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act, the Companys effective income tax rate for fiscal 2005 would have increased to 30.8%, reflecting lower tax exempt income and higher tax rates applicable to non U.S. earnings as compared with fiscal 2004. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it will sell its aircraft leasing business to Terra Firma, a European private equity group, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities. Based on the terms of the agreement and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company revised its estimate of the fair value (less selling costs) of the aircraft leasing business and, as a result, in the fourth quarter reduced the pre tax charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 by approximately $1.1 billion. Full year results for fiscal 2005 reflected a charge of $509 million ($316 million after tax). The sale is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2006 (see Discontinued Operations herein). At fiscal year end, the Company had 53,218 employees worldwide compared with 53,284 at the prior year end. Institutional Securities. Institutional Securities recorded income from continuing operations before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes and dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption of $4.8 billion, an 11% increase from a year ago. Net revenues rose 20% to $15.7 billion driven by record fixed income and higher equity sales and trading revenues, along with strong results in investment banking. Non interest expenses increased 24% to $10.9 billion, reflecting higher compensation levels and costs associated with increased business activity and increased legal reserves. Legal reserves and costs associated with the Coleman Litigation and the Parmalat settlement totaled $535 million (see Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3). The increase in compensation and benefits expense included charges for senior management severance and new hires of approximately $193 million. Investment banking advisory revenues rose 28% from last year to $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase in completed merger and acquisition transactions. Underwriting revenues rose 8% from last year to $2.0 billion with fixed income underwriting revenues driving the increase. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 27%. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were a record $6.8 billion, up 22% from a year ago. The increase was driven by a record year in interest rate and currency products and credit products, partially offset by lower 39 Table of Contents revenues from commodities products. Interest rate and currency product revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues from interest rate cash and derivative products and higher revenues from emerging market fixed income securities. Credit products benefited from increased customer flows in securitized products and favorable trading conditions. Commodities revenues declined from last years record revenues as lower revenues in oil liquids were partially offset by record results in electricity and natural gas products. Equity sales and trading revenues rose 18% from last year to $4.8 billion and reached their highest annual level since fiscal 2000. The increase was driven by strong customer flows in derivatives, record revenues in prime brokerage, improved performance in principal trading strategies and higher revenues from equity cash products. Principal transaction investment revenues were $656 million in fiscal 2005 compared with $364 million a year ago. Fiscal 2005s results included gains from investments in IntercontinentalExchange, International Securities Exchange and Digital Globe Inc., while fiscal 2004s results included a gain on the sale of the Companys investment in TradeWeb. Retail Brokerage. Retail Brokerage recorded pre tax income of $585 million, up 58% from the prior year. Fiscal 2004 was negatively affected by a change in the Companys method of accounting for certain asset management and account fees that reduced pre tax income by $80 million (see Asset Management and Account Fees herein). Excluding this change and Retail Brokerages share ($198 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see Insurance Settlement herein), pre tax income declined by 14%. Net revenues were $5.0 billion, a 9% increase over a year ago and the highest since fiscal 2000. Excluding the accounting methodology change, net revenues increased 6% from last year. Higher asset management, distribution and administration fees were driven primarily by an increase in client assets in fee based accounts, which more than offset lower commissions resulting from a decline in transaction volumes. Total non interest expenses were $4.4 billion, a 4% increase from a year ago. Excluding the insurance settlement, non interest expenses rose 9% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation expense and higher professional services expense, including higher sub advisory fees associated with increased asset and revenue growth, as well as higher legal and consulting costs. Total client assets increased to $617 billion, up 2% from the prior fiscal year end. In addition, client assets in fee based accounts increased 10% from a year ago to a record $173 billion and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 28% from last years 26%. At fiscal year end, the number of global representatives was 9,526, a decline of 1,436 from a year ago, resulting largely from the sales force reduction completed during the year and the net loss of global representatives to competitors. The Company believes that legal and regulatory matters have adversely affected, and in the near term are likely to continue to affect adversely, the operating performance of Retail Brokerage. Asset Management. Asset Management recorded pre tax income of $1.0 billion, a 22% increase from last year. The increase reflected a 6% increase in net revenues to $2.9 billion driven by higher investment gains and an increase in asset management fees. Non interest expenses decreased 1% from the prior year to $1.9 billion as charges for senior management severance and new hires of approximately $41 million were offset by Asset Managements share ($43 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001. Investment gains for the year were $326 million compared with $248 million a year ago, including gains associated with the Companys holdings in Triana Energy Holdings, LLC and Aventine Renewable Energy Holding, LLC. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management of $431 billion were up $7 billion, or 2%, from last year, primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net cash outflows associated with proprietary retail products and institutional separate accounts. Discover. Discover pre tax income was $921 million, a decrease of 25% from last year. Net revenues of $3.5 billion were 2% lower than a year ago, primarily driven by lower servicing and securitization income, reflecting lower net interest cash flows partly resulting from rising short term interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in securitized receivables. The decrease was partially offset by higher net interest income and a decline in the provision for loan losses, reflecting improved credit quality notwithstanding a spike in bankruptcy notices preceding new federal legislation effective October 2005. Non interest expenses increased 9% from the prior year, partially resulting from the acquisition of PULSE, which the Company acquired on January 12, 2005 (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein) and higher compensation costs, 40 Table of Contents including costs associated with senior management changes of approximately $29 million. The managed credit card net principal charge off rate decreased 77 basis points from a year ago to 5.23%, benefiting from the effect of the Companys credit quality and collection initiatives and an industry wide improvement in credit quality. The managed over 30 day delinquency rate decreased 57 basis points to 3.98% from a year ago, and the managed over 90 day delinquency rate was 43 basis points lower than a year ago at 1.75%. Managed credit card loans were $46.9 billion at year end, a decrease of 3% from a year ago, primarily due to historically high cardmember payment rates. Fiscal 2006 Performance Priorities. During fiscal 2005, the Company made substantial changes to its senior management and effected certain organizational and strategic changes that the Company believes will improve its performance in future periods. The Company intends to pursue the following strategic initiatives in order to improve the Companys net revenues, profit margins and return on common shareholders equity: Leverage global scale, franchise and integration across businesses Increase principal activity in order to strike a better balance between principal and customer activity Invest to optimize growth opportunities and achieve best in class status in all businesses Aggressively pursue new opportunities, including bolt on acquisitions Improve operating margins by creating productivity and efficiency gains Create a cohesive one firm culture Institutional Securities will focus on identifying and pursuing what it believes will be high growth areas, such as emerging markets, private equity and mortgage products; improving cross divisional cooperation; taking advantage of opportunities for principal risk taking; and continuing to invest in product innovation and technology. Retail Brokerage will focus on leveraging the Companys institutional expertise to create new products for individual investors; increasing its relationships with client households in the $1 million and greater asset segment; developing, retaining and recruiting high quality global representatives; and continuing to invest in infrastructure and technology. Asset Management will focus on establishing a presence in high growth global products; shifting its focus from profitability to asset growth while maintaining profitability with an emphasis on alternative investment products and other new, high margin products; and continuing to improve investment performance. Discover will focus on increasing card activity, usage and loan balances by building broader acceptance of the Discover Network, strengthening Discovers brand, improving upon the client experience, and introducing new products and services. In addition, Discover will pursue growth opportunities through acquisitions and strategic partnerships, such as the acquisition of the Goldfish credit card business (Goldfish) in fiscal 2006 (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein), and continue to grow its international presence. Global Market and Economic Conditions in Fiscal 2005. Global market and economic conditions were generally favorable for most of fiscal 2005, particularly in the U.S. Global capital markets activity was also higher than in fiscal 2004 despite concerns throughout much of the fiscal year about inflationary pressures, higher oil prices and geopolitical risk. The U.S. economy remained generally strong during fiscal 2005, supported by productivity gains and consumer spending. Consumer confidence strengthened throughout most of fiscal 2005, although concerns about the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina and rising oil prices caused a decline during the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices rose to record levels during fiscal 2005, primarily driven by higher global demand and the disruption of energy supplies caused by Hurricane Katrina. Toward the end of fiscal 2005, however, crude oil prices had 41 Table of Contents declined. Consumer spending and business investment improved, while the U.S. unemployment rate declined to 5.0% from 5.4% a year ago. The equity markets improved modestly during fiscal 2005 as improved corporate earnings and positive economic developments outweighed concerns over oil prices, inflation and the Federal Reserve Boards (the Fed) monetary policy actions. During fiscal 2005, the Fed continued to tighten credit conditions by raising both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate on eight separate occasions by an aggregate of 2.0%. Long term interest rates, however, declined as the yield curve flattened during most of fiscal 2005. Subsequent to fiscal 2005, the Fed raised both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate by an aggregate 0.50%. In Europe, economic growth remained sluggish primarily due to the level of exports, although conditions improved modestly in the latter half of the year. The European Central Bank (the ECB) left the benchmark interest rate unchanged during fiscal 2005. In the U.K., economic growth was marginal as higher oil prices suppressed consumer demand and confidence. During fiscal 2005, the Bank of England lowered the benchmark interest rate by 0.25%. Subsequent to fiscal 2005, the ECB raised the benchmark interest rate by 0.25% in December 2005. The Japanese economy continued to recover as business investment and corporate profits improved, and the jobless rate was near a seven year low. The Japanese equity markets saw a historic rebound during fiscal 2005 as a result of strong growth in corporate earnings as well as signs of an economic recovery and an end to deflation. Economic growth elsewhere in Asia continued, including in China, driven by strength in domestic spending and exports. Business Outlook. As fiscal 2006 began, global economic and market conditions appeared generally stable, trading conditions remained favorable and consumer confidence in the U.S. rose to pre Hurricane Katrina levels. However, investors remained concerned about, among other things, the pace of economic growth, global oil prices, inflation, the U.S. federal budget deficit and geopolitical risk. In the beginning of fiscal 2006, Institutional Securities has experienced relatively strong transaction backlogs in investment banking and generally favorable trading conditions. However, the level of global transaction volumes, market volatility and the Companys market share will continue to affect the results of this business. The Retail Brokerage business will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure during fiscal 2006 that will impact non interest expenses and its pre tax profit margin. Retail Brokerage also expects that the number of financial advisors will decline to approximately 8,600 by the end of fiscal 2006, reflecting fewer new trainees and continued competition for experienced personnel. Asset Management expects lower principal investment gains going forward as it continues to reduce its private equity business. Fiscal 2006s results will be affected by the level of assets under management or supervision, net customer asset flows and the introduction of revenues from higher margin products. Discover expects favorable trends in charge offs in the first half of fiscal 2006 related to improved credit quality. In addition, the October 2005 spike in bankruptcy filings will be charged off primarily in December 2005 in accordance with Company policy. As the Company believes that the spike was, in part, an acceleration of losses that would have been incurred later in 2006, it expects to incur a lower level of bankruptcy losses in subsequent months. (See also Discover Provision for Consumer Loan Losses Delinquencies and Charge offs herein). In fiscal 2006, the Company will be challenged by a slowing growth rate in the U.S. credit card industry, potential rising short term interest rates and an increase in minimum payment requirements. Discovers results for fiscal 2006 will also include the impact of the Goldfish credit card business after its acquisition is completed, which is expected in early 2006. Business Segments. The remainder of Results of Operations is presented on a business segment basis before discontinued operations. Substantially all of the operating revenues and operating expenses of the Company can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures. 42 Table of Contents As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by Asset Management to Retail Brokerage associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to Retail Brokerages global representatives. Income before taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations was $94 million, $118 million and $121 million in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period segment amounts to conform to the current years presentation. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company renamed three of its business segments. The Individual Investor Group was renamed Retail Brokerage, Investment Management was renamed Asset Management and Credit Services was renamed Discover. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the principal components of the residential mortgage loan business previously included in the Discover business segment are managed by and included within the results of the Institutional Securities business segment.

Investment banking revenues were as follows: Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 (dollars in millions) Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions $ 1,478 $ 1,156 $ 662 Equity underwriting revenues 905 993 640 Fixed income underwriting revenues 1,094 859 794 Total investment banking revenues $ 3,477 $ 3,008 $ 2,096 Investment banking revenues increased 16% in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring activities and fixed income underwriting transactions, partially offset by lower revenues from equity underwritings. In fiscal 2004, investment banking revenues increased 44%, primarily reflecting higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring and equity underwriting transactions. Higher revenues from fixed income underwriting transactions also contributed to the increase. In fiscal 2005, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 28% to $1,478 million. Conditions in the worldwide merger and acquisition markets were favorable throughout fiscal 2005, and the Companys advisory revenues reached their highest level in five years. The increase in advisory fees reflected strong contributions from the real estate, energy and utilities, transportation and retail sectors. In fiscal 2004, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 75% to $1,156 million with sectors such as financial services, technology, media and telecommunications, manufacturing and healthcare making strong contributions to the results. 44 Table of Contents Equity underwriting revenues decreased 9% in fiscal 2005, reflective of lower global industry wide equity and equity related activity. The Companys equity underwriting revenues reflected lower revenues from the healthcare and manufacturing sectors, partially offset by higher revenues from the financial services sector. In fiscal 2004, equity underwriting revenues increased 55%, largely due to the resurgence of the initial public offerings market. The global equity markets experienced renewed investor demand for initial public offerings, particularly in the U.S., and the Companys participation in these transactions more than outpaced the industry wide increase in transaction volume. The Companys equity underwriting revenues reflected increases from the financial services, healthcare, media and telecommunications, and technology sectors. Fixed income underwriting revenues rose 27% in fiscal 2005 and 8% in fiscal 2004, primarily reflecting favorable conditions in the global fixed income markets. Although the Fed increased the overnight interest rate in both fiscal years, longer term interest rates remained at relatively low levels. The attractive debt financing environment contributed to higher revenues as issuers continued to take advantage of low financing costs. The Companys revenues from global high yield and securitized fixed income transactions were higher in both periods. In fiscal 2005, acquisition related financing resulting from a strong market for merger and acquisition activity also contributed to the increase. At the end of fiscal 2005, the backlog of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions was higher as compared with the end of fiscal 2004, reflecting improved global market and economic conditions. The backlog for equity underwriting transactions was also higher as compared with the end of the prior fiscal year, reflecting increases across all global regions. The backlog of both merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions as well as equity underwriting transactions is subject to the risk that transactions may not be completed due to unforeseen economic and market conditions, adverse developments regarding one of the parties to the transaction, a failure to obtain required regulatory approval or a decision on the part of the parties involved not to pursue a transaction. Sales and Trading Revenues. Sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transaction trading revenues, commissions and net interest revenues. In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views principal trading, commissions and net interest revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions in securities are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a trade, including any associated commissions, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions and other related expenses. The components of the Companys sales and trading revenues are described below: Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transaction trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions. The Company also engages in proprietary trading activities for its own account. Prior to fiscal 2005, certain investments made by the Company for business facilitation and principal investment purposes were recorded in Financial instruments owned, and gains and losses on such investments were recorded in Principal transaction trading revenues (see Investments herein). Amounts related to these investments are now recorded in Other assets and Principal transaction investment revenues in order to reflect the nature of these positions. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. For fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, $95 million and $24 million, respectively, have been reclassified to Principal transaction investment revenues, and $554 million as of November 30, 2004 has been reclassified to Other assets. Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over the counter (OTC) equity securities and options. Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, 45 Table of Contents reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions. Total sales and trading revenues increased 18% in fiscal 2005 and 5% in fiscal 2004, reflecting higher equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues. Sales and trading revenues include the following: Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004(1) Fiscal2003(1) (dollars in millions) Equities $ 4,804 $ 4,067 $ 3,591 Fixed income(2) 6,782 5,567 5,462 (1) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. (2) Amounts include interest rate and currency products, credit products and commodities. Amounts exclude revenues from corporate lending activities. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 18% in fiscal 2005 to the highest annual level since fiscal 2000. The increase was broad based and included increased customer flows in derivatives, record revenues in prime brokerage, improved performance in principal trading strategies and higher revenues from equity cash products. Derivative revenues increased due to strong customer flows despite continued low levels of volatility in the equity markets. Record revenues in prime brokerage were driven by robust growth in client balances. Global equity market indices generally trended higher and created favorable trading opportunities for principal trading strategies. Revenue from equity cash products rose on higher market volumes, particularly in the European and Asian markets. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 13% in fiscal 2004 driven by record revenues in the prime brokerage business and higher revenues from cash and derivative products. The prime brokerage business experienced significant growth in global customer balances, which resulted in then record annual revenues. Revenues from equity cash products rose, in part, due to increased cash flows into U.S. equity mutual funds. Revenues from equity derivatives increased modestly despite low levels of volatility in the equity markets. Commission revenues continued to be affected by intense competition and a continued shift toward electronic trading. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 22% to a record level in fiscal 2005, primarily due to record revenues from interest rate and currency and credit products, partially offset by lower revenues from commodities products. Interest rate and currency product revenues increased 41% primarily due to higher revenues from interest rate cash and derivative products and higher revenues from emerging market fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from foreign exchange products. Interest rate and currency product revenues benefited from strong new client transaction activity and favorable positioning results. The 19% increase in credit product revenues was primarily due to increased customer flows in securitized products and favorable trading conditions. Commodities revenues decreased 8% from last years record levels as lower revenues in oil liquids were partially offset by record results in electricity and natural gas products. In fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, 47% and 63% of fixed income sales and trading revenues were recorded in the first half of each respective fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, client activity, market volatility and improved risk taking efficiency resulted in improved second half results as compared with the prior year. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 2% to a then record level in fiscal 2004 driven by higher revenues from commodities and credit products, partially offset by lower revenues from interest rate and currency products. Commodities revenues increased 20% to record levels, primarily associated with activities in 46 Table of Contents the energy sector where tight oil supplies, growing demand and global political instability drove energy prices and volatilities higher. Credit product revenues, which increased 1%, reflected record revenues from securitized products as the Company benefited from increased securitization flows in commercial and residential whole loans and favorable trading conditions. Lower revenues from investment grade products partially offset the increase. Interest rate and currency product revenues decreased 7% from fiscal 2003s record levels due to lower revenues from cash and derivative products. In addition, in the second half of fiscal 2004, mixed U.S. economic data coupled with higher global energy prices and concerns about the strength of economic growth resulted in market conditions that the Company did not take advantage of, which adversely affected revenues from certain interest rate products. These decreases were partially offset by record results in foreign exchange and emerging markets, reflecting higher volatility and strong customer volume. In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues include the net revenues from the Companys corporate lending activities. In fiscal 2005, revenues from corporate lending activities decreased by approximately $240 million, reflecting the impact of mark to market valuations on a significantly higher level of new loans made in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004, revenues from corporate lending activities had increased by approximately $110 million, reflecting growth in the loan portfolio amidst improving conditions in the commercial lending market, which largely offset the mark to market valuation impact from new loans. Principal Transactions Investments. Principal transaction net investment revenue aggregating $656 million was recognized in fiscal 2005 as compared with $364 million in fiscal 2004 and $87 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2005s results included gains from investments in IntercontinentalExchange, International Securities Exchange and Digital Globe Inc. Fiscal 2004s results included a gain on the sale of an investment in TradeWeb, an electronic trading platform. Principal investments generally are held for appreciation and are not readily marketable. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. The Company intends to make additional investments over time to bring the level of principal investments to approximately $2.5 billion (see Investments herein). Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from asset management services, primarily fees associated with the Companys real estate fund investment activities. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 6% in fiscal 2005 and 57% in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2004 was due to higher fees associated with real estate investment and advisory activities, primarily due to the acquisition of a majority of the U.S. real estate equity investment management business of Lend Lease Corporation in November 2003 (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein). Other. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues from providing benchmark indices and risk management analytics associated with Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc. (MSCI) and Barra, Inc. (Barra) (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein). Other revenues increased 58% in fiscal 2005 and 121% in fiscal 2004. The increase in both periods was primarily attributable to Barra, which was acquired on June 3, 2004. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 24% in fiscal 2005. Compensation and benefits expense increased 21%, reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and Institutional Securities share ($193 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see Senior Management Compensation Charges herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 29%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 41%, reflecting higher rental 47 Table of Contents costs, primarily in North America. The increase also included a $71 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases (see Lease Adjustment herein). Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 14%, primarily reflecting increased trading activity. Information processing and communications expense increased 11%, primarily due to higher telecommunications, market data and data processing costs. Professional services expense increased 31%, primarily due to higher consulting and legal costs, including costs of $55 million related to the matters below. Other expenses increased 71%, reflecting legal accruals of $360 million related to the Coleman Litigation, approximately $120 million related to the Parmalat settlement and $50 million related to the IPO Allocation Matters, while the prior year included legal accruals of $110 million related to the Parmalat settlement and IPO Allocation Matters (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements and Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3). Fiscal 2004s total non interest expenses increased 22%.

Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 16%, primarily reflecting increased trading activity. Professional services expense increased 42%, primarily due to higher consulting costs, including the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX 404) and the Consolidated Supervised Entities Rule (the CSE Rule) (see Regulatory Developments herein). Legal and employee recruitment costs increased due to higher business activity. Costs for outside legal counsel increased due to certain regulatory and litigation matters. Marketing and business development expense increased 25% due to higher travel and entertainment costs. Other expenses increased 17% and included approximately $25 million relating to Institutional Securities share of the costs associated with a failure to deliver certain prospectuses pursuant to regulatory requirements and a fine associated with a settlement with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the NYSE) relating to the prospectus delivery requirements, operational deficiencies, employee defalcations and other matters. In addition, other expenses included legal accruals of approximately $110 million related to the Parmalat settlement and IPO Allocation Matters (see Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3). 48 Table of Contents RETAIL BROKERAGE INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 320 $ 290 $ 305 Principal transactions: Trading 464 518 651 Investments (1 ) (5 ) 4 Commissions 1,228 1,327 1,231 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,517 2,099 1,696 Interest and dividends 662 409 370 Other 167 133 134 Total revenues 5,357 4,771 4,391 Interest expense 338 156 149 Net revenues 5,019 4,615 4,242 Total non interest expenses 4,434 4,244 3,778 Income before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, net 585 371 464 Provision for income taxes 197 120 194 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, net $ 388 $ 251 $ 270 Investment Banking.

Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 20% in fiscal 2005 and 24% in fiscal 2004. In both fiscal years, the increase was driven by higher client asset balances in fee based accounts, including separately managed and Morgan Stanley ChoiceSM accounts.

Principal transaction net investment gains aggregating $326 million were recognized in fiscal 2005 as compared with gains of $248 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005s results primarily reflected net gains on certain investments in the Companys private equity portfolio, including Triana Energy Holdings, LLC and Aventine Renewable Energy Holding, LLC. Fiscal 2004s results also primarily reflected net gains on certain investments in the Companys private equity portfolio, including Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. and Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. Lower investment gains are expected going forward as Asset Management continues to reduce its private equity business. Private equity investments generally are held for appreciation and are not readily marketable. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions (see Investments herein). Commissions. Asset Management primarily generates commission revenues from dealer and distribution concessions on sales of certain funds. Commission revenues increased 7% in fiscal 2005 and 50% in fiscal 2004. The increase in both periods reflected an increase in commissionable sales of certain fund products. 51 Table of Contents Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.

Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 3% in fiscal 2005 and 10% in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, higher fund management and administration fees associated with a 9% increase in average assets 52 Table of Contents under management were partially offset by lower distribution fees. In addition, although average equity assets under management increased 13%, a greater proportion of these assets was in products generating lower fees as compared with the prior year period. The increase in fiscal 2004 reflected higher fund management and administration fees associated with a 15% increase in average assets under management or supervision. The increase in revenues in fiscal 2004 also reflected a more favorable average asset mix, including a greater percentage of equity assets under management, partially offset by an increase in institutional fixed income and liquidity fund products, which generate lower fees than equity products. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses decreased 1% in fiscal 2005, including Asset Managements share ($43 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see Insurance Settlement herein).

Compensation and benefits expense increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and Asset Managements share ($41 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see Senior Management Compensation Charges herein). Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 7%, primarily reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open ended funds. Marketing and business development expenses increased 19% primarily due to higher promotional costs associated with the Companys Van Kampen products. Professional services expense increased 6% due to higher sub advisory fees, partially offset by lower legal and consulting fees. Other expenses decreased 20%, primarily due to a reduction in legal reserves resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters, partially offset by higher insurance expense. Fiscal 2004s total non interest expenses increased 7%. Compensation and benefits expense increased 21%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and higher amortization expense related to equity based awards (see Stock Based Compensation herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses were relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003. Professional services expense increased 45%, primarily reflecting an increase in sub advisory, legal and consulting fees, including costs associated with the establishment of the independent private equity firm that manages Morgan Stanley Capital Partners funds in a long term sub advisory capacity. Marketing and business development expense decreased 22%, primarily due to lower promotional costs. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 7%, reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open ended funds. 53 Table of Contents DISCOVER INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 (dollars in millions) Merchant, cardmember and other fees $ 1,323 $ 1,317 $ 1,377 Servicing and securitization income 1,609 1,921 1,922 Other 5 10 14 Total non interest revenues 2,937 3,248 3,313 Interest revenue 2,174 1,859 2,046 Interest expense 781 648 790 Net interest income 1,393 1,211 1,256 Provision for consumer loan losses 878 926 1,266 Net credit income 515 285 (10 ) Net revenues 3,452 3,533 3,303 Total non interest expenses 2,531 2,312 2,276 Income before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, net 921 1,221 1,027 Provision for income taxes 340 443 378 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, net $ 581 $ 778 $ 649 Merchant, Cardmember and Other Fees. Merchant, cardmember and other fees include revenues from fees charged to merchants on credit card sales (net of interchange fees paid to banks that issue cards on the Companys merchant and cash access network), transaction processing fees on debit card transactions as well as charges to cardmembers for late payment fees, overlimit fees, balance transfer fees, credit protection fees and cash advance fees, net of cardmember rewards. Cardmember rewards include various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus&reg; reward program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based upon a cardmembers level and type of purchases. In fiscal 2005, merchant, cardmember and other fees were relatively unchanged as higher transaction processing revenues were offset by higher net cardmember rewards. The increase in transaction processing revenues was related to the acquisition of PULSE on January 12, 2005 (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein). The increase in net cardmember rewards reflected record sales volume and the impact of promotional programs. Merchant, cardmember and other fees decreased 4% in fiscal 2004. The decrease was due to lower cardmember fees and higher net cardmember rewards, partially offset by higher balance transfer fees and merchant discount revenues. The decline in cardmember fees was due to lower late payment and overlimit fees, reflecting fewer late fee occurrences and a decline in the number of accounts charged an overlimit fee, partially offset by lower charge offs of such fees. Late fee occurrences were lower primarily due to a decline during fiscal 2004 in the over 30 day delinquency rates. Overlimit fees declined due to fewer overlimit accounts and the Companys modification of its overlimit fee policies and procedures in response to industry wide regulatory guidance. The increase in net cardmember rewards reflected the impact of promotional programs and higher sales volume. Balance transfer fees increased as a result of the Companys continued focus on improving balance transfer profitability. The increase in merchant discount revenue was due to higher sales volume. 54 Table of Contents Servicing and Securitization Income. Servicing and securitization income is revenue derived from consumer loans that have been sold to investors through asset securitizations. Cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized general purpose credit card loans as well as interchange fees for certain securitization transactions are used to pay investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans and to pay the Company a fee for servicing the loans (servicing rights). Any excess cash flows remaining (excess servicing rights) are paid to the Company. The sale of general purpose credit card loans through asset securitizations, therefore, has the effect of converting portions of net credit income and fee income to servicing and securitization income. Included in servicing and securitization income are revenues from servicing rights, excess servicing rights and gains or losses on general purpose credit card asset securitizations as well as the change in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in general purpose credit card asset securitizations. The table below presents the components of servicing and securitization income: Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004 Fiscal2003 (dollars in millions) Merchant, cardmember and other fees $ 694 $ 650 $ 727 Other revenue (78 ) (8 ) 30 Total non interest revenues 616 642 757 Interest revenue 3,530 3,842 4,114 Interest expense 1,025 692 771 Net interest income 2,505 3,150 3,343 Provision for consumer loan losses 1,512 1,871 2,178 Net credit income 993 1,279 1,165 Servicing and securitization income $ 1,609 $ 1,921 $ 1,922 Servicing and securitization income is affected by the level of securitized loans, the spread between the net interest yield on the securitized loans and the yield paid to the investors, the rate of credit losses on securitized loans and the level of merchant, cardmember and other fees earned. Servicing and securitization income decreased 16% in fiscal 2005, reflecting lower net interest cash flows and other revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for consumer loan losses and higher merchant, cardmember and other fees. The decrease in net interest cash flows was attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a higher weighted average coupon rate paid to investors associated with the higher short term interest rate environment. The interest yield was relatively unchanged from the prior year as the impact of the increase in the prime rate was offset by a decline in higher rate loans due to improved credit quality and various pricing initiatives. The lower provision for consumer loan losses was primarily attributable to a lower rate of net principal charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans, partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charge offs. The increase in merchant, cardmember and other fees reflected the allocation of interchange revenue to certain securitization transactions and lower fee net charge offs, partially offset by lower assessed late payment and overlimit fees. In fiscal 2004, servicing and securitization income was relatively unchanged as lower cardmember fees, net interest cash flows and other revenue were partially offset by a lower provision for consumer loan losses. Cardmember fees declined due to lower late payment and overlimit fees, partially offset by higher balance transfer fees and lower fee net charge offs. The decrease in net interest cash flows was largely attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. The decrease in the provision for consumer loan losses was attributable to a lower rate of net principal charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. The Other revenue component of servicing and securitization income, which includes net securitization gains and losses on general purpose credit card loans and the change in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in 55 Table of Contents general purpose credit card asset securitizations, decreased $70 million in fiscal 2005 and $38 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a lower level of securitized receivables and a decline in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in securitized receivables as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications and its impact on future charge offs. The decrease in such revenue in fiscal 2004 was attributable to a lower level of average general purpose credit card securitization transactions and higher net gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions. The net proceeds received from general purpose credit card asset securitizations were $7,240 million in fiscal 2005 and $3,714 million in fiscal 2004. The credit card asset securitization transactions completed in fiscal 2005 have expected maturities ranging from approximately three to five years from the date of issuance. Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest revenue derived from consumer loans and short term investment assets and interest expense incurred to finance those loans and assets. Assets, consisting primarily of consumer loans, currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market indexed variable rates. The Company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates. Interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the Company as part of its interest rate risk management program. This program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Companys right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. Net interest income increased 15% in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest revenue was primarily due to an increase in average general purpose credit card loans, which was partly attributable to a higher level of securitization maturities and the deferment of new securitization transactions due to the exploration of the potential spin off of Discover (see Board Approval to Retain Discover herein). The increase in interest expense was largely due to a higher level of average interest bearing liabilities, primarily to support the increase in average general purpose credit card loans. Net interest income decreased 4% in fiscal 2004 due to a decline in interest revenue that was partially offset by lower interest expense. The decline in interest revenue was primarily due to a decrease in average general purpose credit card loans. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower level of average interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in the Companys average cost of borrowings. The Companys average cost of borrowings was 4.13% for fiscal 2004 as compared with 4.49% for fiscal 2003. The decline in the average cost of borrowings reflected the favorable impact of replacing certain maturing fixed rate debt with lower cost financing. 56 Table of Contents The following tables present analyses of Discovers average balance sheets and interest rates in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and changes in net interest income during those fiscal years: Average Balance Sheet Analysis.

The Company expects this increase in minimum payment requirements to impact negatively future levels of general purpose credit card loans and related interest and fee revenue and charge offs. During fiscal 2005, the Company implemented a relief plan to assist certain cardmembers affected by Hurricane Katrina. The relief plan included temporarily suspending minimum payment requirements, temporarily waiving penalty fees and charging 0% interest on purchases for six months after the cardmember requested to be covered by the relief plan. As of November 30, 2005, approximately 1% of the Companys managed general purpose credit card loans were made to cardmembers in the affected Gulf Coast region and were therefore subject to this relief plan. While the Company has taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with its cardmember relief plan and the other effects of Hurricane Katrina on its business, future levels of general purpose credit card loans, related interest and fee revenue, and charge offs may still be negatively affected. Provision for Consumer Loan Losses. The provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the Company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses. In calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. 58 Table of Contents The Companys provision for consumer loan losses was $878 million, $926 million and $1,266 million for fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The Companys allowance for consumer loan losses was $838 million at November 30, 2005 and $943 million at November 30, 2004. The provision for consumer loan losses decreased 5% in fiscal 2005. The decrease reflected a higher net release of reserves and lower net charge offs as compared with the prior year period due to improvement in credit quality in the Companys consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by the impact of higher bankruptcy filings in advance of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005. The net reduction in reserves in fiscal 2005 totaled approximately $100 million as compared with a net reduction of approximately $60 million in the prior year period. The Company believes that the spike in bankruptcy filings in October 2005 was, in part, an acceleration of losses that would have been incurred later in 2006. In determining the allowance for loan losses as of November 30, 2005, the Company considered the impact of the current trends in bankruptcy filings. The peak filing month was October 2005, which will be recognized as charge offs (in accordance with the Companys accounting policy) in December 2005. The allowance for loan losses has provided for these charge offs, in addition to other impacts of the change in bankruptcy legislation that were known or highly certain to the Company at November 30, 2005. In fiscal 2004, the provision for consumer loan losses decreased 27%, primarily due to lower net principal charge offs resulting from an improvement in credit quality, including lower bankruptcy charge offs driven by a decline in U.S. personal bankruptcy filings. The decrease was also due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans. The Company reduced the allowance for consumer loan losses by approximately $60 million in fiscal 2004 as compared with an increase of approximately $70 million in fiscal 2003 due to improvement in credit quality, including lower delinquency rates and dollars. Delinquencies and Charge offs. General purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when contractual payments become 30 days past due. General purpose credit card loans generally are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies, probate accounts and fraudulent transactions. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day contractual time frame. Fraudulent transactions are reported in consumer loans at their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of the fraud through a charge to operating expenses and are subsequently written off at the end of the month 90 days following notification but not later than the contractual 180 day time frame. Loan delinquencies and charge offs are affected by changes in economic conditions, account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors. Delinquency rates in both the over 30 and over 90 day categories and net principal charge off rates were lower for both the owned and managed portfolios in fiscal 2005, reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality (see Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data herein). The improvement in net principal charge off rates was partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charge offs related to consumers filing for bankruptcy in advance of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005. In fiscal 2004, net principal charge off rates decreased in both the owned and managed portfolios as compared with fiscal 2003, reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality and a lower level of bankruptcy filings. Delinquency rates in both the over 30 and over 90 day categories were lower in both the owned and managed portfolios at November 30, 2004 as compared with November 30, 2003, also reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality. The Companys future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above. Factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, new laws and regulations and interpretations thereof, 59 Table of Contents bankruptcy trends, the seasoning of the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and the rate and magnitude of changes in the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 9% in fiscal 2005, partially resulting from the acquisition of PULSE (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein). Compensation and benefits expense increased 15%, including Discovers share ($29 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see Senior Management Compensation Charges herein), as well as an increase in personnel costs, including salaries and benefits. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 7%. Marketing and business development expense increased 2% due to increased marketing and advertising costs. Professional services expense increased 12% due to higher consulting fees partially related to the exploration of the potential spin off of Discover (see Board Approval to Retain Discover herein) and an increase in legal and account collection fees. Other expenses increased 16%, primarily reflecting an increase in certain operating expenses, including accruals for losses associated with cardmember fraud and higher legal accruals. Fiscal 2004s total non interest expenses increased 2% from fiscal 2003. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 5% due to lower employee benefit costs, as well as lower salaries resulting from lower employment levels due, in part, to workforce reductions conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 5%. Marketing and business development expense increased 20% due to increased marketing costs associated with account acquisition, merchant initiatives and advertising. Other expenses decreased 8%, primarily reflecting a decrease in certain operating expenses, including lower losses associated with cardmember fraud. Seasonal Factors. Discovers activities are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing. Historically, a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter, followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter. Merchant fees, therefore, historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting higher sales activity in the month of December. Additionally, higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume. Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data. The Company analyzes its financial performance on both a managed loan basis and as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) (owned loan basis). Managed loan data assume that the Companys securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the Companys owned loans. The Company operates its Discover business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis. Accordingly, underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans. The Company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations. In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis, which provides a more meaningful comparison with industry competitors. 60 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of owned and managed average loan balances, returns on receivables, interest yields and interest rate spreads for the periods indicated: Reconciliation of General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 AverageBalance Return on Receivables(1) InterestYield InterestRateSpread AverageBalance Return on Receivables(1) InterestYield InterestRateSpread AverageBalance Return on Receivables(1) InterestYield InterestRateSpread General Purpose Credit Card Loans: Owned $ 19,932 2.92 % 10.12 % 5.94 % $ 17,608 4.43 % 10.05 % 5.92 % $ 19,531 3.32 % 10.02 % 5.53 % Securitized 27,398 2.12 % 12.88 % 9.16 % 29,779 2.62 % 12.90 % 10.56 % 31,333 2.07 % 13.13 % 10.64 % Managed $ 47,330 1.23 % 11.72 % 7.81 % $ 47,387 1.65 % 11.84 % 8.88 % $ 50,864 1.28 % 11.93 % 8.71 % (1) Return on receivables is equal to Discover income divided by average owned, securitized or managed credit card receivables, as applicable.

Board Approval to Retain Discover. On April 4, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to pursue a spin off of Discover Financial Services. On August 17, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had determined that it is in the best interest of shareholders to retain Discover Financial Services and to no longer pursue a spin off. Discontinued Operations. As described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 17, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved managements recommendation to sell the Companys non core aircraft leasing business. In connection with this action, the aircraft leasing business was classified as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, and reported as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of approximately $1.7 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reflect the write down of the aircraft leasing business to its estimated fair value of approximately $2.0 billion. In determining the charge that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company estimated the value to be realized in selling the aircraft leasing business as a whole. The estimated value of the business was based on the appraised values of the aircraft portfolio, an evaluation of then current market conditions, recent transactions involving the sales of similar aircraft leasing businesses, a detailed assessment of the portfolio and additional valuation analyses. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it will sell its aircraft leasing business to Terra Firma, a European private equity group, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities. Based on the terms of the agreement and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company revised its estimate of the fair value (less selling costs) of the aircraft leasing business and, as a result, in the fourth quarter reduced the pre tax charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 by approximately $1.1 billion. Full year results for fiscal 2005 reflected a charge of $509 million ($316 million after tax). The sale is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2006. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company entered into agreements for the sale of certain aircraft. Accordingly, the Company designated such aircraft as held for sale and recorded a $42 million pre tax loss related to the write down of these aircraft to fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As of February 3, 2005, all of these aircraft were sold. In addition, during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, the Company recorded aircraft impairment charges in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). The table below provides information regarding the pre tax loss on discontinued operations and the aircraft impairment charges that are included in these amounts (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Pre tax loss from discontinued operations $ 486 $ 172 $ 393 Aircraft impairment charges 109 287 The pre tax loss on discontinued operations for fiscal 2003 also included a $36 million charge to adjust the carrying value of previously impaired aircraft to market value (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). 62 Table of Contents Senior Management Compensation Charges. Compensation and benefits expense in fiscal 2005 included charges for certain members of senior management related to severance and new hires, which increased non interest expenses by approximately $311 million. These compensation charges were allocated to the Companys business segments as follows: Institutional Securities ($193 million), Retail Brokerage ($48 million), Asset Management ($41 million) and Discover ($29 million). Coleman Litigation. On May 8, 2003, Coleman (Parent) Holdings Inc. (CPH) filed a complaint against the Company in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County. The complaint relates to the merger between The Coleman Company, Inc. (Coleman) and Sunbeam, Inc. (Sunbeam) in 1998. The complaint, as amended, alleges that CPH was induced to agree to the transaction with Sunbeam based on certain financial misrepresentations, and it asserts claims against the Company for aiding and abetting fraud, conspiracy and punitive damages. Shortly before trial, which commenced in April 2005, the trial court granted, in part, a motion for entry of a default judgment against the Company and ordered that portions of CPHs complaint, including those setting forth CPHs primary allegations against the Company, be read to the jury and deemed established for all purposes in the action. In May 2005, the jury returned a verdict in favor of CPH and awarded CPH $604 million in compensatory damages and $850 million in punitive damages. On June 23, 2005, the trial court issued a final judgment in favor of CPH in the amount of $1,578 million, which includes prejudgment interest and excludes certain payments received by CPH in settlement of related claims against others. On June 27, 2005, the Company filed a notice of appeal with the District Court of Appeal for the Fourth District of Florida and posted a supersedeas bond, which automatically stayed execution of the judgment pending appeal. Included in cash and securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements in the consolidated statement of financial condition is $1,863 million of commercial paper and other securities which have been pledged to obtain the bond which was posted in this matter. The Company filed its initial brief in support of its appeal on December 7, 2005. The Companys appeal seeks to reverse the judgment of the trial court on several grounds and asks that the case be remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of the Company or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The Company believes, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is probable that the compensatory and punitive damages awards will be overturned on appeal and the case remanded for a new trial. Taking into account the advice of outside counsel, the Company is maintaining a reserve of $360 million for the Coleman litigation, which it believes to be a reasonable estimate, under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, of the low end of the range of its probable exposure in the event the judgment is overturned and the case remanded for a new trial. If the compensatory and or punitive awards are ultimately upheld on appeal, in whole or in part, the Company may incur an additional expense equal to the difference between the amount affirmed on appeal (and post judgment interest thereon) and the amount of the reserve. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the amount of such additional expense, such additional expense could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company and or the Companys or Institutional Securities operating results for a particular future period, and the upper end of the range could exceed $1.2 billion. For further information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Parmalat. On July 18, 2005, the Italian government approved the settlement agreement that the Company and its subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank International Ltd., had entered into with the administrator of Parmalat pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay 155 million to Parmalat as part of a settlement of all existing and potential claims between the Company and Parmalat. For further information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Business Acquisitions and Sales. On December 20, 2005, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Goldfish credit card business from Lloyds TSB for approximately &pound;1 billion. The acquisition of Goldfish will add approximately 800,000 accounts and approximately &pound;0.8 billion of receivables to the Companys existing U.K. credit card business. The Company currently expects the transaction to be completed in February 2006. The results of Goldfish will be included within the Discover business segment as of the date of acquisition. 63 Table of Contents On January 12, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of PULSE, a U.S. based automated teller machine/debit and electronic funds transfer network currently serving banks, credit unions, and savings and other financial institutions. The Company believes that the combination of the PULSE and Discover Networks will create a leading electronic payments company offering a full range of products and services for financial institutions, consumers and merchants. As of the date of acquisition, the results of PULSE are included within the Discover business segment. The Company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of $329 million in connection with the acquisition (see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements). On June 3, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Barra, a global leader in delivering risk management systems and services to managers of portfolio and firm wide investment risk. The Company believes that the combination of MSCI, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, and Barra created a leading global provider of benchmark indices and risk management analytics. Since the date of acquisition, the results of Barra have been included within the Institutional Securities business segment. In February 2005, the Company sold its 50% interest in POSIT, an equity crossing system that matches institutional buyers and sellers, to Investment Technology Group, Inc. The Company acquired the POSIT interest as part of its acquisition of Barra. As a result of the sale, the net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased by approximately $75 million (see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements). In fiscal 2003, the Company acquired selected components of the U.S. real estate equity advisory businesses of Lend Lease Corporation, an Australia based company. The financial statement impact of this acquisition, which is included in the Companys Institutional Securities segment, was not significant. Insurance Settlement. On September 11, 2001, the U.S. experienced terrorist attacks targeted against New York City and Washington, D.C. The attacks in New York resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center complex, where approximately 3,700 of the Companys employees were located, and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the U.S. Through the implementation of its business recovery plans, the Company relocated its displaced employees to other facilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company settled its claim with its insurance carriers related to the events of September 11, 2001. The Company recorded a pre tax gain of $251 million as the insurance recovery was in excess of previously recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks (primarily write offs of leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the World Trade Center complex, employee relocation and certain other employee related expenditures). The pre tax gain, which was recorded as a reduction to non interest expenses, is included within the Retail Brokerage ($198 million), Asset Management ($43 million) and Institutional Securities ($10 million) segments. The insurance settlement was allocated to the respective segments in accordance with the relative damages sustained by each segment. Stock Based Compensation. In fiscal 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, using the prospective adoption method for both deferred stock and stock options. In fiscal 2005, the Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R, which revised the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarified SFAS No. 123s guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to service periods. SFAS No. 123R also amended SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as financing cash inflows rather than as a reduction of taxes paid, which is included within operating cash flows. 64 Table of Contents Upon adoption of SFAS 123R using the modified prospective approach, the Company recognized an $80 million gain ($49 million after tax) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 resulting from the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred. The cumulative effect gain increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05. In accordance with SFAS 123R, fiscal 2005 compensation expense included the amortization of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 equity based awards but did not include any amortization for fiscal 2005 year end awards. This had the effect of reducing compensation expense in fiscal 2005. If SFAS No. 123R were not in effect, fiscal 2005s compensation expense would have included three years of amortization (i.e., for awards granted in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005). In addition, the fiscal 2005 year end awards, which were granted in December 2005 and which will begin to be amortized in fiscal 2006, will be amortized over a shorter period (primarily two and three years) as compared with awards granted in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 (primarily three and four years). The shorter amortization period will have the effect of increasing compensation expense in fiscal 2006. In addition, fiscal 2006 compensation expense will include the amortization of fiscal 2003, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 equity based awards. For stock based awards issued prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Companys accounting policy for such awards granted to retirement eligible employees was to recognize compensation cost over the service period specified in the award terms. The Company accelerates any unrecognized compensation cost if and when a retirement eligible employee leaves the Company. For stock based awards made to retirement eligible employees after the adoption of SFAS 123R on December 1, 2004, the Companys accounting policy is to treat such awards as fully vested on the date of grant unless other provisions of the award terms operate as substantive service conditions. For awards granted to retirement eligible employees during fiscal 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for such awards on the date of grant. The Company modified certain terms of the fiscal 2005 year end awards, which were granted in December 2005. As a result of such changes, the Company is in the process of evaluating the accounting treatment for fiscal 2005 year end awards that were granted to retirement eligible employees. If it is determined that the compensation expense for such awards should be recognized at the date of grant instead of over the relevant service period, incremental compensation expense of approximately $300 million will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Lease Adjustment. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company did not record the effects of scheduled rent increases and rent free periods for certain real estate leases on a straight line basis. In addition, the Company had been accounting for certain tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvements instead of recording funds received as deferred rent and amortizing them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for these rent escalation clauses, rent free periods and tenant improvement allowances to properly reflect lease expense over the lease term on a straight line basis. The cumulative effect of this correction resulted in the Company recording $109 million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The impact of this change was included within non interest expenses and reduced income before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($71 million), Retail Brokerage ($29 million), Asset Management ($5 million) and Discover ($4 million) segments. The impact of this correction was not material for all periods presented to the pre tax income of each of the segments or to the Company. Income Tax Examinations. The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and states in which the Company has significant business operations, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction; for example, the current IRS examination, which recently began, covers 1999 2004. The Company has filed an appeal with respect to unresolved issues relative to the IRS examination of years 1994 1998. The Company believes that the settlement of the IRS examination of years 1994 1998 will not have a material negative impact on the consolidated statement of income of the Company. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations. The 65 Table of Contents Company has established tax reserves that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts tax reserves only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. The Company believes that the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statement of income for a particular future period and on the Companys effective income tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act, adopted on October 22, 2004, provided for a special one time tax deduction, or dividend received deduction, of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a companys last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $309 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, resulting from the Companys repatriation of approximately $4.0 billion of qualifying foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The $309 million tax benefit resulted from the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities previously provided under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, net of additional taxes associated with these qualifying earnings. Asset Management and Account Fees. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company was improperly recognizing certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid at the beginning of the relevant contract periods, which is when such fees were billed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of accounting for such fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period, generally quarterly or annually. As a result of the change, the Companys results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included an adjustment to reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid to representatives. The impact of this change reduced net revenues by $107 million, non interest expenses by $27 million and income before taxes by $80 million, at both the Company and the Retail Brokerage segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Such adjustment reduced net income by approximately $50 million and basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05. If the above referenced fees and expenses had been recognized over the relevant contract period in the past, pre tax income for the Company and the Retail Brokerage segment would have been lower by the following amounts: Decrease in Pre tax Income (dollars inmillions) Quarter ended: February 28, 2003 $ (5.2 ) May 31, 2003 (1.3 ) August 31, 2003 (4.2 ) November 30, 2003 (2.0 ) Fiscal 2003 total (12.7 ) February 29, 2004 (3.1 ) May 31, 2004 (2.6 ) August 31, 2004 (2.3 ) Investments in Unconsolidated Investees. The Company invests in unconsolidated investees that own synthetic fuel production plants. The Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting. The Companys share of the operating 66 Table of Contents losses generated by these investments is recorded within Losses from unconsolidated investees, and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded within the Companys Provision for income taxes. In fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, the losses from unconsolidated investees were more than offset by the respective tax credits and tax benefits on the losses. The table below provides information regarding the losses from unconsolidated investees, tax credits and tax benefits on the losses: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Losses from unconsolidated investees $ 311 $ 328 $ 279 Tax credits 336 351 308 Tax benefits on losses 124 132 112 Under the current tax law, synthetic fuels tax credits are granted under Section 29 (or, for the Companys fiscal years beginning after 2005, under Section 45K) of the Internal Revenue Code. Synthetic fuels tax credits are available in full only when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the tax code, as adjusted for inflation (Base Price). The Base Price for each calendar year is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. If the annual average price of a barrel of oil in 2005 or future years exceeds the applicable Base Price, the synthetic fuels tax credits generated by the Companys synthetic fuel facilities will be phased out, on a ratable basis, over the phase out range. Synthetic fuels tax credits realized in prior years are not affected by this limitation. Based on the annual average price of a barrel of oil in 2005, the Company does not expect to lose any synthetic fuels tax credits generated in 2005 due to phase out. In fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, the Company entered into derivative contracts designed to reduce its exposure to rising oil prices and the potential phase out of the synthetic fuels tax credits in 2005 and 2006. Changes in fair value relative to these derivative contracts are included within Principal transactions trading revenues. IRS field auditors had contested the placed in service date of several synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of the Companys unconsolidated investees (the LLC). To qualify for the Section 29 tax credits, the production facility must have been placed in service before July 1, 1998. The IRS has issued a Technical Advice Memorandum confirming that the LLC synthetic fuel facilities at issue meet the placed in service requirement under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. The LLC has been informed that the IRS field auditors have decided to close the audit without any disallowance of tax credits. Pension Plans. Contributions. The Company made contributions of $272 million and $120 million to its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions by considering the interaction of several factors. Such factors include the range of potential contributions (for example, the minimum required contribution up to the maximum tax deductible amount under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA), the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. At November 30, 2005, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the Companys pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Qualified Plan). For its non U.S. plans, the Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations. Liabilities for benefits payable under its unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries. 67 Table of Contents Pension Expense. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees occurs. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rate, which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, is used to measure the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and to calculate the service cost and interest cost. For fiscal 2005, the assumed discount rate for all U.S. plans was selected by the Company, in consultation with its independent actuaries, using a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the Qualified Plan liabilities. The pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on duration implicit in a representative broad based Aa corporate bond universe of high quality fixed income investments. It includes only bonds of reasonable issue size and excludes certain types of bonds, such as callable bonds. As of November 30, 2005, the Qualified Plan represented 92% of the total assets of the Companys U.S. and non U.S. pension plans combined. The Company, in consultation with its independent actuaries, set the assumed discount rates used for non U.S. pension plans based on the nature of liabilities, local economic environments and available bond indices. For fiscal years prior to 2005, the assumed discount rate for all U.S. plans was determined with reference to a standardized benchmark (the annualized Moodys Aa long term corporate bond yield average) adjusted for the difference in the duration of the bonds underlying the benchmark and the duration of the Qualified Plan liabilities. A secondary validation of the discount rate was then performed using a bond model customized to reflect the characteristics of the Qualified Plan liabilities. The expected long term rate of return on assets represents the Companys best estimate of the long term return on plan assets and generally was estimated by computing a weighted average return of the underlying long term expected returns on the different asset classes, based on the target asset allocations. For plans where there is no established target asset allocation, actual asset allocations were used. The expected long term return on assets is a long term assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one year to the next unless there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions. The Qualified Plans target asset allocation policy changed in August 2004 from 55%/45% equity/fixed income to 50%/50% equity/fixed income and, as a result, the Company, in consultation with its independent investment consultants and actuaries, lowered its expected long term rate of return on its Qualified Plan assets from 7.25% to 7.00% for fiscal 2005 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The impact of this change was not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2005. In September 2005, the Qualified Plans target asset allocation policy changed from 50%/50% equity/fixed income to 45%/55% equity/fixed income, and the duration of the fixed income portfolio was extended. As a result of this change, the Company expects to lower the expected long term rate of return on its Qualified Plan assets for fiscal 2006. The Companys fiscal 2005 expected long term rate of return on assets for its Qualified Plan was based on the following target asset allocation: Target InvestmentMix Expected AnnualReturn(1) Domestic equity: Large capitalization 30 % 8.0 % Small capitalization 8 % 8.4 % International equity 12 % 8.4 % Fixed income: Long term government/corporate 50 % 5.2 % (1) These returns do not include the impact of diversification on the overall expected portfolio return. 68 Table of Contents Each year the Company compares its initial estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets for the Qualified Plan (and adjusts, if necessary) with a portfolio return calculator model (the Portfolio Model) that produces a range of expected returns for the portfolio. Return assumptions used are forward looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns. The Portfolio Model begins with the current U.S. Treasury yield curve, recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields. Corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums, based on current market conditions, are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class. Expenses that are expected to be paid from the investment return are reflected. This includes investment and transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets, added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds, as well as administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The Company uses the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets component of pension expense. For the Qualified Plan, expected returns are computed based on a market related value of assets. The market related value of assets is a smoothed actuarial value of assets equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period. The market related value of assets must be no greater than 120% and no less than 80% of the market value of assets. Investment income equal to the expected return on the plans assets as calculated for the prior years expense is recognized immediately. Any difference between the actual investment income (on a market value basis) and the expected return is recognized over a five year period in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. Other assumptions, including mortality rates, long term salary growth and employee turnover rates, are set by the Company in consultation with its independent actuaries. These assumptions are tested every year by monitoring gains and losses, performing assumption studies as needed, and monitoring Company objectives and actuarial trends. These assumptions are adjusted whenever necessary. The Company generally amortizes (as a component of pension expense) unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service of active participants (5 to 20 years depending upon the plan) to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. The loss amortization component for the U.S. and the non U.S. pension plans was $49 million for fiscal 2005 (30% of pension expense) and $38 million for fiscal 2004 (29% of pension expense). New Accounting Developments. Limited Partnerships. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 5, a general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership and therefore should include the limited partnership in its consolidated financial statements regardless of the amount or extent of the general partners interest unless a majority of the limited partners can vote to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without having to show cause or the limited partners have substantive participating rights that can overcome the presumption of control by the general partner. EITF Issue No. 04 5 was effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified. For all other existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have not been modified, the Company is required to adopt EITF Issue No. 04 5 on December 1, 2006 in a manner similar to a cumulative effect type adjustment or by retrospective application. The Company is currently assessing the impact on these existing limited partnerships of adopting the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 5; however, because the Company generally expects to provide limited partners in these funds with rights to remove the Company as general partner or rights to terminate the partnership, the Company does not expect the impact of EITF Issue No. 04 5 to be material. 69 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Financial Instruments Used For Trading and Investment. Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, which include cash and derivative products, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and gains and losses are reflected in principal trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The fair value of the Companys Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are generally based on observable market prices, observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for Financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded. Bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time. Ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time. A substantial percentage of the fair value of the Companys Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased is based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product (or a related product) may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment. The price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. Price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace, and the characteristics particular to the transaction. Products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency. By contrast, products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency. Even in normally active markets, the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation. Alternatively, in thinly quoted markets, the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation. The Companys cash products include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, other sovereign debt obligations, corporate and other debt securities, corporate equity securities, exchange traded funds and physical commodities. The fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters. These products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value. Examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, exchange traded corporate equity securities, most municipal debt securities, most corporate debt securities, most high yield debt securities, physical commodities, certain tradable loan products and most mortgage backed securities. 70 Table of Contents In certain circumstances, principally involving loan products and other financial instruments held for securitization transactions, the Company determines fair value from within the range of bid and ask prices such that fair value indicates the value likely to be realized in a current market transaction. Bid prices reflect the price that the Company and others pay, or stand ready to pay, to originators of such assets. Ask prices represent the prices that the Company and others require to sell such assets to the entities that acquire the financial instruments for purposes of completing the securitization transactions. Generally, the fair value of such acquired assets is based upon the bid price in the market for the instrument or similar instruments. In general, the loans and similar assets are valued at bid pricing levels until structuring of the related securitization is substantially complete and such that the value likely to be realized in a current transaction is consistent with the price that a securitization entity will pay to acquire the financial instruments. Factors affecting securitized value and investor demand relating specifically to loan products include, but are not limited to, loan type, underlying property type and geographic location, loan interest rate, loan to value ratios, debt service coverage ratio, investor demand and credit enhancement levels. In addition, some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency, and the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, certain tradable loan products, distressed debt securities (i.e., securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties, including bankruptcy or insolvency) and equity securities that are not publicly traded. Generally, the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product, which can include cash flow analysis, revenue or net income analysis, default recovery analysis (i.e., analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery) and other analyses applied consistently. The following table presents the valuation of the Companys cash products included within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased by level of price transparency (dollars in millions): At November 30, 2005 At November 30, 2004 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Observable market prices, parameters or derived from observable prices or parameters $ 203,590 $ 101,972 $ 145,327 $ 66,948 Reduced or no price transparency 11,131 76 9,240 827 Total $ 214,721 $ 102,048 $ 154,567 $ 67,775 The Companys derivative products include exchange traded and OTC derivatives. Exchange traded derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above. OTC derivatives, whose fair value is derived using pricing models, include a wide variety of instruments, such as interest rate swap and option contracts, foreign currency option contracts, credit and equity swap and option contracts, and commodity swap and option contracts. The following table presents the fair value of the Companys exchange traded and OTC derivatives included within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased (dollars in millions): At November 30, 2005 At November 30, 2004 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Exchange traded $ 4,491 $ 8,151 $ 2,754 $ 4,815 OTC 41,403 36,801 46,721 38,725 Total $ 45,894 $ 44,952 $ 49,475 $ 43,540 The fair value of OTC derivative contracts is derived primarily using pricing models, which may require multiple market input parameters. Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity. These adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based upon observable market data where available. In the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices 71 Table of Contents or parameters of other comparable current market transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, fair value is based on the transaction price. The Company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by OTC derivatives. Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed form analytic formulae, such as the Black Scholes option pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof, applied consistently. In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Company are widely accepted by the financial services industry. Pricing models take into account the contract terms, including the maturity, as well as market parameters such as interest rates, volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts. A substantial majority of OTC derivative products valued by the Company using pricing models fall into this category. Other derivative products, typically the newest and most complex products, will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the models market parameters. The Company manages its market exposure for OTC derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or other related financial instruments. The Companys trading divisions, the Financial Control Department and the Market Risk Department continuously monitor the price changes of the OTC derivatives in relation to the offsetting positions. For a further discussion of the price transparency of the Companys OTC derivative products, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A. Equity and debt securities purchased in connection with private equity and other principal investment activities initially are carried in the consolidated financial statements at their original costs, which approximate fair value. The carrying value of such securities is adjusted when changes in the underlying fair values are readily ascertainable, generally as evidenced by observable market prices or transactions that directly affect the value of such securities. Downward adjustments relating to such securities are made in the event that the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value. The Companys partnership interests, including general partnership and limited partnership interests in real estate funds, are included within Other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and are recorded at fair value based upon changes in the fair value of the underlying partnerships net assets. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible. In the event that market prices or parameters are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial Control and Market Risk Departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products.

Allowance for Consumer Loan Losses. The allowance for consumer loan losses in the Companys Discover business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses. Provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio and is evaluated quarterly for adequacy. In calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. A provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses (see Discover Provision for Consumer Loan Losses herein). Aircraft under Operating Leases. Aircraft Held for Sale. On August 17, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved managements recommendation to sell the Companys non core aircraft leasing business. In connection with this action, the aircraft leasing business was classified as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144 and reported as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The aircraft portfolio was not depreciated after August 17, 2005. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of approximately $1.7 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reflect the write down of the aircraft leasing business to its estimated fair value of approximately $2.0 billion. In determining the charge that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company estimated the value to be realized in selling the aircraft leasing business as a whole. The estimated value of the business was based on the appraised values of the aircraft portfolio, an evaluation of then current market conditions, recent transactions involving the sales of similar aircraft leasing businesses, a detailed assessment of the portfolio and additional valuation analyses. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it will sell its aircraft leasing business to Terra Firma, a European private equity group, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities. Based on the terms of the agreement and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company revised its estimate of the fair value (less selling costs) of the aircraft leasing business and, as a result, in the fourth quarter reduced the pre tax charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 by approximately $1.1 billion. Full year results for fiscal 2005 reflected a charge of $509 million ($316 million after tax). The sale is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2006. 73 Table of Contents Aircraft to Be Held and Used. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, aircraft under operating leases that were to be held and used were stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Depreciation was calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the aircraft asset, which was generally 25 years from the date of manufacture. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Companys aircraft that were to be held and used were reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the aircraft may not be recoverable. Under SFAS No. 144, the carrying value of an aircraft may not be recoverable if its projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value. If an aircrafts projected undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value, the Company recognized an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the aircraft. The fair value of the Companys impaired aircraft was based upon the average market appraisal values obtained from independent appraisal companies. Estimates of future cash flows associated with the aircraft assets as well as the appraisals of fair value are critical to the determination of whether an impairment exists and the amount of the impairment charge, if any (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress. The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The number of these reviews, investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including the Company. Reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case by case basis and represent an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of litigation, regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a 74 Table of Contents change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded reserves, if any. See Notes 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings and tax examinations. Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations. The Companys results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors. In addition, results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including political, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of capital; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates; currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; the availability and cost of credit; inflation; and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. In addition, there continues to be a heightened level of legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could increase costs, thereby affecting future results of operations. Such factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect the Companys business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. 75 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Companys senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. These committees, along with the Companys Treasury Department and other control groups, also assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure, thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the Companys liquidity and capital policies. For a description of the Companys other principal risks and how they are monitored and managed, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A. The Companys liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the Company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations when they come due without material, adverse franchise or business impact. The key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the Companys business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. The principal elements of the Companys liquidity framework are the cash capital policy, the liquidity reserve and stress testing through the contingency funding plan. Comprehensive financing guidelines (collateralized funding, long term funding strategy, surplus capacity, diversification, staggered maturities and committed credit facilities) support the Companys target liquidity profile. The Balance Sheet. The Company monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. Given the nature of the Companys market making and customer financing activities, the overall size of the balance sheet fluctuates from time to time. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing and managing its business. The Companys total assets increased to $898.5 billion at November 30, 2005 from $747.3 billion at November 30, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases in securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed and financial instruments owned (largely driven by increases in corporate and other debt and corporate equities). The increases were largely the result of higher market levels globally and an increase in client business opportunities. Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a companys overall liquidity and capital policies. The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends. The Company has adopted a definition of adjusted assets that excludes certain self funded assets considered to have minimal market, credit and or liquidity risk. These low risk assets generally are attributable to the Companys matched book and securities lending businesses. Adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125, and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised. The adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets (as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs). In addition, the Company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities. These characteristics include the long dated nature (final maturity at issuance of 30 years extendible at the Companys option by a further 19 years), the Companys ability to defer coupon 76 Table of Contents interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters and the subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure. The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these securities. The following table sets forth the Companys total assets, adjusted assets and leverage ratios as of November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004 and for the average month end balances during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004: Balance at Average Month EndBalance November 30,2005 November 30,2004 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 (dollars in millions, except ratio data) Total assets $ 898,523 $ 747,334 $ 828,009 $ 711,833 Less: Securities purchased under agreements to resell (174,330 ) (123,041 ) (147,057 ) (98,485 ) Securities borrowed (244,241 ) (208,349 ) (225,984 ) (191,767 ) Add: Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased 147,000 111,315 130,936 127,736 Less: Derivative contracts sold, not yet purchased (44,952 ) (43,540 ) (42,192 ) (42,488 ) Subtotal 582,000 483,719 543,712 506,829 Less: Segregated customer cash and securities balances (30,540 ) (26,534 ) (30,483 ) (25,596 ) Assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FIN 46, as revised (67,091 ) (44,895 ) (56,865 ) (39,728 ) Goodwill and intangible assets (2,500 ) (2,199 ) (2,471 ) (1,761 ) Adjusted assets $ 481,869 $ 410,091 $ 453,893 $ 439,744 Shareholders equity $ 29,182 $ 28,206 $ 28,501 $ 26,718 Junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts 2,764 2,897 2,859 2,877 Subtotal 31,946 31,103 31,360 29,595 Less: Goodwill and intangible assets (2,500 ) (2,199 ) (2,471 ) (1,761 ) Tangible shareholders equity $ 29,446 $ 28,904 $ 28,889 $ 27,834 Leverage ratio(1) 30.5 x 25.9 x 28.7 x 25.6 x Adjusted leverage ratio(2) 16.4 x 14.2 x 15.7 x 15.8 x (1) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders equity. (2) Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity. The Companys total capital consists of shareholders equity, long term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months), junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts, and Capital Units. At November 30, 2005, total capital was $125.9 billion, an increase of $15.1 billion from November 30, 2004. During the 12 months ended November 30, 2005, the Company issued senior notes aggregating $35.3 billion, including non U.S. dollar currency notes aggregating $15.0 billion. In connection with the note issuances, the Company has entered into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short term London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) trading levels. At November 30, 2005, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Companys senior debt indentures) was approximately $132 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries). The weighted average maturity of the Companys long term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately five years at November 30, 2005. Subsequent to fiscal year end and through January 31, 2006, the Companys long term borrowings (net of repayments) increased by approximately $6 billion. Economic Capital. The Company uses an economic capital model to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support the risk of its business activities and to ensure that the Company remains adequately capitalized. The Company 77 Table of Contents calculates economic capital on a going concern basis, which is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators, rating agencies and the market. Business unit economic capital allocations are evaluated by benchmarking to similarly rated peer firms by business segment. The Company believes this methodology provides an indication of the appropriate level of capital for each business segment as if each were an independent operating entity. Economic capital requirements are allocated to each business segment and are sub allocated to product lines as appropriate. This process is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business, provide business managers with tools for measuring and managing risk, and allow senior management to evaluate risk adjusted returns (such as return on economic capital and shareholder value added) to facilitate resource allocation decisions. The Companys methodology is based on an approach that assigns economic capital to each business unit based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses. Regulatory capital, including additional capital assigned for goodwill, intangible assets and principal investment risk, is a minimum requirement to ensure funding access and customer credibility. The Company believes it must be able to sustain stress losses and maintain capital substantially above regulatory minimums while supporting ongoing business activities. Aggregate economic capital requirements represent the minimum amount of book equity capital required under the going concern approach. The difference between the Companys consolidated common equity and aggregate economic capital denotes the Companys unallocated capital position, which is not currently allocated to the business segments or reflected in business segment performance metrics. The Company assesses stress loss capital across various dimensions of market, credit, business and operational risks. Stress losses are defined at the 90% to 95% confidence interval in order to capture worst potential losses in 10 to 20 years. Stress loss calculations are tangible and transparent and avoid reliance on extreme loss statistical models. Market risk scenarios capture systematic, idiosyncratic and random market risk through the use of internal market stress data. Credit risk is included in the form of idiosyncratic counterparty default events. Business risk incorporates earnings volatility due to variability in revenue flows, with estimates on the mix of fixed versus variable expenses at various points in the business cycle. Operational stress losses primarily reflect legal risk across the Company. The Company may enhance the economic capital model and allocation methodology over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment to ensure that the model continues to reflect the risks inherent in the Companys business activities and to reflect changes in the drivers of the level and cost of required capital. The following table presents the allocation of the Companys average common equity during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 Average common equity (dollars in billions): Institutional Securities $ 14.6 $ 13.3 Retail Brokerage 3.7 3.5 Asset Management 1.7 1.7 Discover 4.4 3.9 Total from operating segments 24.4 22.4 Discontinued operations 1.2 1.5 Unallocated capital 2.9 2.8 Consolidated $ 28.5 $ 26.7 78 Table of Contents Equity Capital Management Policies. The Companys senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and, therefore, pursues a strategy of ensuring that the Companys equity base adequately reflects and provides protection from the economic risks inherent in its businesses. Capital is required for, among other things, the Companys inventories, underwritings, principal investments, consumer loans, bridge loans and other financings, and investments in fixed assets, including aircraft assets (see Discontinued Operations herein). The Company also considers return on common equity to be an important measure of its performance, in the context of both the particular business environment in which the Company is operating and its peer groups results. In this regard, the Company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total equity, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity. At November 30, 2005, the Companys equity capital (which includes shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts) was $31.9 billion, an increase of $0.8 billion from November 30, 2004. The Company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to purchase, subject to market conditions and certain other factors, shares of common stock for capital management purposes. There were no repurchases made under the capital management authorization during fiscal 2005. The unused portion of this authorization at January 31, 2006 was approximately $600 million. The Company also has an ongoing repurchase authorization in connection with awards granted under its equity based compensation plans. During fiscal 2005, the Company purchased approximately $3.7 billion of its common stock (approximately 68 million shares) through a combination of open market purchases and purchases from employees at an average cost of $54.31 (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5). The Company currently anticipates that it will repurchase between $2 billion and $4 billion of its common stock pursuant to its equity antidilution program during fiscal 2006. The actual amount of repurchases will be subject to market conditions and certain other factors. The Board of Directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In December 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.27. 79 Table of Contents Liquidity Management Policies. The primary goal of the Companys liquidity and funding activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments. Given the highly liquid nature of the Companys balance sheet, day to day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of stable collateralized financing. The Company has centralized management of credit sensitive unsecured funding sources in the Treasury Department. In order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability, the Company has designed a liquidity management framework. Liquidity ManagementFramework: Designed to: Contingency Funding Plan Ascertain the Companys ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the businesses. The contingency funding plan sets forth the process and the internal and external communication flows necessary to ensure effective management of the contingency event. Analytical processes exist to periodically evaluate and report the liquidity risk exposures of the organization under management defined scenarios. Cash Capital Ensure that the Company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its financial obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt. The Company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash capital (long term debt and equity capital) to finance illiquid assets and the portion of its securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment. Liquidity Reserve Maintain, at all times, a liquidity reserve composed of immediately available cash and cash equivalents and a pool of unencumbered securities that can be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity to the Company. The reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on day to day funding requirements and strategic liquidity targets. The liquidity reserve averaged approximately $48 billion during fiscal 2005, of which approximately $32 billion on average was held at the parent company. Contingency Funding Plan. The Companys Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year; (ii) maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral; (iii) return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities; (iv) additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a ratings downgrade; (v) higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding; (vi) client cash withdrawals; (vii) drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; and (viii) discretionary unsecured debt buybacks. The Companys CFP is developed at the legal entity level in order to capture specific cash requirements and availability for the parent company and each of its major operating subsidiaries. The CFP assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be trapped at subsidiaries due to regulatory, legal or tax constraints. In addition, the CFP assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities. Bank subsidiaries that operate in a deposit protected environment are not expected to be impacted by a Company specific credit event and are expected to continue to provide reliable funding for assets held in these entities. These entities include Discover Bank, which primarily funds credit card receivables, and Morgan Stanley Bank, which funds senior loans and certain mortgage assets. Discover Bank also accesses the asset backed financing market for a significant portion of its funding requirements. 80 Table of Contents Cash Capital. The Company maintains a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include the parent companys equity and the non current portion of certain long term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following: (i) illiquid assets such as buildings, aircraft (see Discontinued Operations herein), equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and principal investments; (ii) a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment (i.e., stressed haircuts); and (iii) expected drawdowns on unfunded commitments. The Company seeks to maintain a surplus cash capital position. The Companys equity capital of $31.9 billion (including junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts), long term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months) of $93.9 billion and Capital Units of $66 million comprised the Companys total capital of $125.9 billion as of November 30, 2005, which substantially exceeded cash capital requirements. Liquidity Reserve. The Company seeks to maintain a target liquidity reserve that is sized to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets, including coverage of a significant portion of expected cash outflows over a short term horizon in a potential liquidity crisis. This liquidity reserve is held in the form of cash deposits with banks and a pool of unencumbered securities. The Company manages the pool of unencumbered securities, against which funding can be raised, on a global basis, and securities for the pool are chosen accordingly. The U.S. component, held in the form of a reverse repurchase agreement at the parent company, consists primarily of U.S. government bonds and at November 30, 2005 was approximately $24 billion and averaged approximately $16 billion for the year ended November 30, 2005. The non U.S. component consists of European government bonds and other high quality collateral. The parent company cash component of the liquidity reserve at November 30, 2005 was approximately $14 billion and averaged approximately $16 billion for the year ended November 30, 2005. The Company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserve (cash and securities) is maintained enhances its ability to quickly and efficiently source funding in a stressed environment. The Companys funding requirements and target liquidity reserve may vary based on changes in the level and composition of its balance sheet, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors. Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of committed credit facilities serves to further diversify the Companys funding sources. The Company values committed credit as a secondary component of its liquidity management framework. The committed credit facilities include a diversification of lenders to the Company covering geographic regions, including North America, Europe and Asia. The Company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs, including the issuance of commercial paper, which consists of two separate tranches: a U.S. dollar tranche with the Company as borrower and a Japanese yen tranche with Morgan Stanley Japan Limited (MSJL) as borrower and the Company as guarantor. Under this combined facility (the MS MSJL Facility), the banks are committed to provide up to $5.5 billion under the U.S. dollar tranche and 70 billion Japanese yen under the Japanese yen tranche. At November 30, 2005, the Company had a $10.8 billion consolidated stockholders equity surplus as compared with the MS MSJL Facilitys covenant requirement. The Company maintains a master collateral facility that enables Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (MS&Co.), one of the Companys U.S. broker dealer subsidiaries, to pledge certain collateral to secure loan arrangements, letters of credit and other financial accommodations (the MS&Co. Facility). As part of the MS&Co. Facility, MS&Co. also maintains a secured committed credit agreement with a group of banks that are parties to the master collateral facility under which such banks are committed to provide up to $1.8 billion. At 81 Table of Contents November 30, 2005, MS&Co. had a $2.6 billion surplus consolidated stockholders equity and a $0.1 billion surplus Net Capital as defined in the MS&Co. Facility and each as compared with the MS&Co. Facilitys covenant requirements. The Company also maintains a revolving credit facility that enables Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (MSIL), the Companys London based broker dealer subsidiary, to obtain committed funding from a syndicate of banks (the MSIL Facility) by providing a broad range of collateral under repurchase agreements for a secured repo facility and a Company guarantee for an unsecured facility. The syndicate of banks is committed to provide up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion, available in six major currencies. At November 30, 2005, MSIL had a $3.0 billion surplus Shareholders Funds and a $2.9 billion surplus Financial Resources under U.K. GAAP (each as determined in accordance with the MSIL Facility) as compared with the MSIL Facilitys covenant requirements. The Company anticipates that it may utilize the MS MSJL Facility, the MS&Co. Facility or the MSIL Facility (the Credit Facilities) for short term funding from time to time (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in any of its Credit Facilities will impair its ability to obtain funding under the Credit Facilities, to pay its current level of dividends, or to obtain loan arrangements, letters of credit or other financial accommodations. At November 30, 2005, no borrowings were outstanding under any of the Credit Facilities. The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain certain committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs. These facilities are expected to be drawn from time to time to cover short term funding needs. On a yearly basis, the Companys committed credit strategy is reviewed and approved by its senior management. This strategy takes the Companys total liquidity sources into consideration when determining the appropriate size and mix of committed credit. The Company, through one of its subsidiaries, maintains several funded committed credit facilities to support the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan business. Lenders to these facilities provided an aggregate of $18.2 billion in financing at November 30, 2005. Funding Management Policies. The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include the Companys equity capital; long term debt; repurchase agreements; U.S., Canadian, Euro, Japanese and Australian commercial paper; asset backed securitizations; letters of credit; unsecured bond borrowings; securities lending; buy/sell agreements; municipal reinvestments; promissory notes; master notes; and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. Repurchase agreement transactions, securities lending and a portion of the Companys bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and, therefore, provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the U.S., European and Asian markets, targeting global investors and currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The Companys bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers, purchase Federal Funds, issue short term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes. Interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings, brokered and other time deposits. Savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits obtained from individual securities clients. Brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit issued by the Companys bank subsidiaries. Other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposit. The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations that would result from an interruption in the availability of the Companys funding sources. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding 82 Table of Contents sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period. The Company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity. In addition, the Company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least 110% of its outstanding short term unsecured borrowings. The Company also maintains committed credit facilities (described above) to support its ongoing borrowing programs. Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with stable collateralized borrowings, while the securitization market allows for the securitization of the credit card receivables arising from the Companys Discover business. The Companys goal is to maximize funding through less credit sensitive collateralized borrowings and asset securitizations in order to reduce reliance on unsecured financing. The Institutional Securities business emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding, which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. As part of this effort, the Institutional Securities business continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity. Similarly, Discover, through its use of the securitization market, reduces the need for other unsecured parent company financing. Unsecured Financing. The Company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories, consumer loans and illiquid assets. In general, securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding, floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate. Fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt. Both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt (in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the Companys Discover business) are used to finance the Companys consumer loan portfolio. Consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed. The Company uses derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management, reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company issues long term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its Cash Capital Policy. In addition to these needs, long term debt funding is employed to enhance the Companys liquidity position by reducing reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings). Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. The Company has a portfolio approach for managing the unsecured debt issued by the parent company. This approach gives the Company flexibility to manage the unsecured debt portfolio across maturities, currencies, investors and regions, taking into account market capacity and pricing. Down lending to subsidiaries is managed to ensure that intercompany borrowings mature before those of the parent company. Liquidity and funding policies recognize potential constraints on the Companys ability to transfer funds between regulated entities and the parent company. During fiscal 2005, the Companys long term financing strategy was driven, in part, by its continued focus on improved balance sheet strength (evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions), a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings. As a result, for fiscal 2005, $27 billion of unsecured debt was issued (excluding certain equity and credit linked products not considered to be a component of the Companys cash capital). Financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing 83 Table of Contents risk, and a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as well as international institutional and retail clients. Unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately $13 billion. Credit Ratings. The Companys reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important. The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the Companys short term and long term credit ratings. Factors that are significant to the determination of the Companys credit ratings or that otherwise affect its ability to raise short term and long term financing include the Companys level and volatility of earnings, relative positions in the markets in which it operates, geographic and product diversification, retention of key personnel, risk management policies, cash liquidity, capital structure, corporate lending credit risk, and legal and regulatory developments. In addition, continuing consolidation in the credit card industry presents Discover with stronger competitors that may challenge future growth. A deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the Company, thereby increasing the cost to the Company in obtaining unsecured funding. In addition, the Companys debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business, the Company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors. At November 30, 2005, the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the Companys senior debt credit rating was approximately $1,213 million. Of this amount, $422 million relates to bilateral arrangements between the Company and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the other. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the Company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded. As of January 31, 2006, the Companys credit ratings were as follows: Commercial Paper Senior Debt Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited(1) R 1 (middle) AA (low) Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Moodys Investors Service(2) P 1 Aa3 Rating and Investment Information, Inc. a 1+ AA Standard & Poors A 1 A+ (1) On April 5, 2005, Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited changed the outlook on the Companys senior debt ratings from Stable to Negative. (2) On April 5, 2005, Moodys Investors Service changed the outlook on the Companys senior debt ratings from Stable to Negative. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities and Discover businesses. Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes special purpose entities (SPE) primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the 84 Table of Contents consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the Companys Institutional Securities business were approximately $3.6 billion at November 30, 2005, the majority of which were related to residential mortgage loan, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys Institutional Securities securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities, the Companys arrangements with these entities and its adoption of FIN 46, as revised. The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Discover Activities. The asset securitization market is a significant source of funding for the Companys Discover business. By utilizing this market, the Company further diversifies its funding sources, realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the Companys other funding sources, including unsecured debt. The securitization transaction structures utilized for the Discover business are accounted for as sales; i.e., off balance sheet transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In connection with its credit card securitization program, the Company transfers credit card receivables, on a revolving basis, to the trusts, which issue asset backed securities that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed. This structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions, potentially resulting in the need for the Company to obtain alternative funding arrangements. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (economic early amortization). Economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows (which would occur if the coupon, contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables) and is driven primarily by the trusts credit card receivables performance (in particular, receivables yield, cardmember fees and credit losses incurred) as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities. In the event of an economic early amortization, receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from the Company would instead continue to be recognized on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities. These recognized receivables would require the Company to obtain alternative funding. The increase in bankruptcy notifications, which reflected an increase in consumers filing for bankruptcy in advance of the new U.S. bank legislation that became effective in October 2005, affected the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT), a trust utilized by the Company to access the securitization markets through the issuance of multiple series of securities. The DCMT agreements contain provisions that require early amortization of securities issued by the trust if Group Excess Spread (a measure of trust profitability as further defined in the DCMT agreements) falls below zero over a three month rolling average period (Early Amortization Trigger). One particular series that supported a short term certificate program had, in addition to the standard Early Amortization Trigger, another provision that required Group Excess Spread be at least 2% in order to continue to issue certificates. In order to avoid a potential prohibition on the continued ability to issue certificates, the Company decided to retire this particular series. No series in the trust has experienced or expects to experience an early amortization event. Guarantees. FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. FIN 45 defines guarantees as contracts 85 Table of Contents and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. FIN 45 also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The table below summarizes certain information regarding derivative contracts, financial guarantees to third parties, market value guarantees and liquidity facilities at November 30, 2005: Maximum Potential Payout/Notional CarryingAmount Collateral/Recourse Years to Maturity Type of Guarantee Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 Total (dollars in millions) Derivative contracts $ 477,387 $ 408,869 $ 537,232 $ 444,284 $ 1,867,772 $ 28,563 $ 106 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees 4,432 250 603 1,756 7,041 83 854 Market value guarantees 15 131 78 676 900 54 135 Liquidity facilities 1,437 8 49 98 1,592 See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information on indemnities, exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees, general partner guarantees, securitized asset guarantees, merchant chargeback guarantees and other guarantees. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments. In connection with its operating activities, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations, as well as commitments to fund certain fixed assets and other less liquid investments. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2005 include long term borrowings, operating leases and purchase obligations. The Companys future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations as of November 30, 2005 are summarized below: Payments Due in: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 2008 Fiscal 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (dollars in millions) Long term borrowings(1) $ 13,822 $ 41,098 $ 17,536 $ 38,009 $ 110,465 Operating leases(2) 438 819 605 1,718 3,580 Purchase obligations(3) 465 596 228 1,289 Total $ 14,725 $ 42,513 $ 18,369 $ 39,727 $ 115,334 (1) See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, advertising, sponsorship, and computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2005 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The table above does not include amounts associated with the Companys definitive agreement to acquire Goldfish from Lloyds TSB for approximately &pound;1 billion (see Business Acquisitions and Sales herein). 86 Table of Contents The Companys commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, principal investments and private equity activities, and lending and financing commitments as of November 30, 2005 are summarized below by period of expiration. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: Years to Maturity Total Lessthan 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) Letters of credit(1) $ 6,903 $ 1 $ $ $ 6,904 Principal investment activities 178 150 28 200 556 Investment grade lending commitments(2) 4,324 5,218 11,705 2,721 23,968 Non investment grade lending commitments(2) 2,376 5,916 3,654 1,120 13,066 Commitments for secured lending transactions(3) 10,582 1,624 86 90 12,382 Commitments to purchase mortgage loans(4) 6,304 6,304 Total(5) $ 30,667 $ 12,909 $ 15,473 $ 4,131 $ 63,180 (1) This amount represents the Companys outstanding letters of credit, which are primarily used to satisfy various collateral requirements. (2) The Companys investment grade and non investment grade lending commitments are made in connection with its corporate lending activities. Credit ratings are determined by the Companys Institutional Credit Department using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or lower are considered non investment grade. (3) This amount represents lending commitments extended by the Company to companies that are secured by assets of the borrower. Loans made under these arrangements typically are at variable rates and generally provide for over collateralization based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. (4) This amount represents the Companys forward purchase contracts involving mortgage loans. (5) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The table above does not include commitments to extend credit for consumer loans of approximately $255 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company guarantees the debt and or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. At November 30, 2005, the Company had commitments to enter into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements of approximately $90 billion and $57 billion, respectively. 87 Table of Contents Investments. The table below includes investments made by the Company that represent business facilitation or principal investing activities at November 30, 2005 and are included within Other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Business facilitation investments are strategic investments undertaken by the Company to facilitate core business activities. Principal investing activities are capital commitments provided to private companies, generally, for proprietary purposes to maximize total returns to the Company. The Company has committed to increasing its principal investing activity in an attempt to improve its financial performance. The Company intends to make additional investments over time to bring the level of principal investments to approximately $2.5 billion.

Regulatory Developments. In June 2004, the SEC issued rules that permit certain highly capitalized broker dealers that are part of a consolidated supervised entity to apply to the SEC for approval to use an alternative method for calculating net capital charges (the CSE Rules). To obtain approval to calculate capital under the alternative method in the CSE Rules, a broker dealers holding company must consent, on a voluntary basis, to group wide supervision and examination by the SEC and must have in place group wide internal risk management controls and calculate capital in a manner generally consistent with the standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). The CSE Rules are intended to reduce regulatory capital costs for qualifying firms by permitting such firms to use proprietary mathematical risk measurement models for regulatory capital computation and internal control purposes. On July 28, 2005, the SEC approved an application by MS&Co., one of the Companys U.S. broker dealers, for authorization to use, effective December 1, 2005, the alternative method of computing net capital set forth in the CSE Rules. The approval allows MS&Co. to use an alternative method based on mathematical models to calculate net capital charges for market and derivatives related credit risk. The CSE Rules are also designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory requirements on U.S. securities firms resulting from the European Union (EU) Directive (2002/87/EC) concerning the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the EU. Under this directive, financial groups that conduct business through regulated financial entities in the EU must first demonstrate that they are subject to equivalent consolidated supervision at the ultimate holding company level. On November 30, 2005, the U.K. Financial Services Authority determined that the SEC undertakes equivalent consolidated supervision for the Company. The Company continues to work with its regulators on the implementation of the CSE Rules and Basel II capital standards. As rules related to Basel II are released, the Company will consult with regulators on the new 88 Table of Contents requirements. Compliance with EU requirements (capital, oversight and reporting) will be a focus item through 2008. Regulatory Capital Requirements. MS&Co. and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. (MSDWI) are registered broker dealers and registered futures commission merchants and, accordingly, are subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC, the NYSE and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MSIL, a London based broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority, and MSJL, a Tokyo based broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Agency. MS&Co., MSDWI, MSIL and MSJL have consistently operated in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC insured financial institutions must maintain (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (leverage ratio), (b) 4% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio) and (c) 8% of total capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (total risk weighted capital ratio). At November 30, 2005, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio and total risk weighted capital ratio of each of the Companys FDIC insured financial institutions exceeded these regulatory minimums. Certain other U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to various securities, commodities and banking regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. These subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their local capital adequacy requirements. Morgan Stanley Derivative Products Inc., the Companys triple A rated derivative products subsidiary, maintains certain operating restrictions that have been reviewed by various rating agencies. Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets, upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. 89 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Risk Management. Risk Management Policy and Control Structure. Risk is an inherent part of the Companys business and activities. The extent to which the Company properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability. The Companys broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole. The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in the Companys business activities: market, credit, operational, legal, and liquidity and funding risk. Liquidity and funding risk is discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. The Companys currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The cornerstone of the Companys risk management philosophy is protection of the Companys franchise, reputation and financial standing. The Companys risk management philosophy is based on the following principles: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. Given the importance of effective risk management to the Companys reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters. Risk management at the Company requires independent Company level oversight, accountability of the Companys business segments, constant communication, judgment, and knowledge of specialized products and markets. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segment level. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business, the Companys risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification. The nature of the Companys risks, coupled with this risk management philosophy, informs the Companys risk governance structure. The Companys risk governance structure includes the Firm Risk Committee and the Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee, the Chief Risk Officer, the Internal Audit Department, independent control groups, and various risk control managers, committees and groups located within the business segments. The Firm Risk Committee, composed of the Companys most senior officers, oversees the Companys risk management structure. The Firm Risk Committees responsibilities include oversight of the Companys risk management principles, procedures and limits and the monitoring of material financial, operational and franchise risks. The Firm Risk Committee is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee). The Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee (the Capital Committee) reviews strategic transactions for the Company and significant changes to the Companys capital structure. The Capital Committees responsibilities include reviewing measures of capital and evaluating capital resources relative to the Companys risk profile and strategy. The Chief Risk Officer, a member of the Firm Risk Committee, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of Company risk limits; reviews material market and credit risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department periodically examines the Companys operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories. 90 Table of Contents The Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Control, Treasury and Law Departments (collectively, the Company Control Groups), which are all independent of the Companys business units, assist senior management and the Firm Risk Committee in monitoring and controlling the Companys risk through a number of control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Companys risk management and monitoring systems and processes. Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for ensuring that the business segment, as applicable adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the Firm Risk Committee; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls. Each of the Companys business segments also has designated operations officers, committees and groups, including operations and information technology groups (collectively, Segment Control Groups and, together with the Company Control Groups, the Control Groups) to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee. The Control Groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the business segments market and credit risk profile, sales practices, pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Control Groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review. The following is a discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (other than liquidity and funding risk). The discussion focuses on the Companys securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and consumer lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Companys market risk exposure generated by the Companys statistical analyses are forward looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below. Market Risk. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business where the substantial majority of the Companys Value at Risk (VaR) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading related market risk within Retail Brokerage. Asset Management incurs non trading market risk primarily from capital investments in funds and investments in private equity vehicles. Discover is also exposed to non trading market risk primarily through changes in interest rates related to its consumer lending activities. Sound market risk management is an integral part of the Companys culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent. The Control Groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Companys risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries 91 Table of Contents and maintains the Companys VaR system. A variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk. Market risk is monitored through various measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to, and discussed with, senior management. Sales and Trading and Related Activities. Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management. During fiscal 2005, the Company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities. The Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions. The Company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related derivatives. The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Companys aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management. Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management. The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Companys trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing VaR and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses. The Companys trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and the Market Risk Department. The Market Risk Department also conducts scenario analyses, which estimate the Companys revenue sensitivity to a set of specific, predefined market and geopolitical events. Value at Risk (VaR). The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR based risk measures to various levels of management. 92 Table of Contents VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. The Company estimates VaR using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors (market risk factors); and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. The Companys VaR model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Companys 99%/one day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 1%, or once in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. The Companys VaR model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and interest rate risk, and linear exposures to implied volatility risks. Market risks that are incorporated in the VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities. As a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors, the Companys VaR model uses Monte Carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products (i.e., corporate bonds and credit derivatives). The Companys VaR models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks; reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities; and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodologys limitations, which include the following: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. The Company is aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and control at the trading desk, division and Company levels. VaR for Fiscal 2005. The table below presents the Companys Aggregate (Trading and Non trading), Trading and Non trading VaR for each of the Companys primary market risk exposures at November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004, incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the Companys trading businesses. This measure of VaR incorporates most of the Companys trading related market risks. However, a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in VaR, and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different VaR results from those produced using more precise measures. For example, risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a VaR context. Aggregate Trading and Non trading VaR also incorporates (a) the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and (b) public company equity positions recorded as investments by the Company. Investments made by the Company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the VaR results reported below. As of November 30, 2005, the aggregate carrying value of such investments was approximately $2.0 billion. 93 Table of Contents Since the VaR statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in 100 trading days. The table below presents VaR for each of the Companys primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004: Aggregate (Trading and Non trading) Trading Non trading Table 1: 99% Total VaR 99%/One Day VaR at November 30, 99%/One Day VaR at November 30, 99%/One Day VaR at November 30, Primary Market Risk Category 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 56 $ 71 $ 51 $ 53 $ 35 $ 30 Equity price 41 42 36 38 10 5 Foreign exchange rate 10 10 10 10 Commodity price 50 27 50 27 Subtotal 157 150 147 128 45 35 Less diversification benefit(1) 64 56 65 48 7 5 Total VaR $ 93 $ 94 $ 82 $ 80 $ 38 $ 30 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between Total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category. The Companys Aggregate VaR and Trading VaR at November 30, 2005 were $93 million and $82 million, respectively, compared with $94 million and $80 million, respectively, at November 30, 2004. Non trading VaR at November 30, 2005 increased to $38 million from $30 million at November 30, 2004 due to an increase in Non trading interest rate and credit spread VaR and equity price VaR. Non trading interest rate and credit spread VaR increased due to an increase in interest rate risk associated with funding liabilities. Non trading equity price VaR increased primarily due to a concentrated position in principal investments resulting from a recent initial public offering in which the Company was an investor. The Company views average Trading VaR over the fiscal year as more representative of trends in the business than VaR at any single point in time. Table 2 below, which presents the high, low and average 99%/one day Trading VaR during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, represents substantially all of the Companys trading activities. Certain market risks included in the year end Aggregate VaR discussed above are excluded from these measures (e.g., equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the Company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions). Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2005 increased to $85 million from $73 million in fiscal 2004, reflecting increases in interest rate and credit spread VaR and commodity price VaR. The increase in interest rate and credit spread VaR was predominantly driven by increased exposures to credit sensitive instruments (e.g., corporate debt securities) and to interest rate levels. The increase in commodity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased exposures to energy (i.e., natural gas and electricity) and oil products (i.e., crude and distillates). Table 2: 99% High/Low/Average Trading VaR Daily 99%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2005 Daily 99%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2004 Primary Market Risk Category High Low Average High Low Average (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 81 $ 44 $ 58 $ 80 $ 39 $ 50 Equity price 48 25 35 48 24 34 Foreign exchange rate 22 7 12 21 6 11 Commodity price 53 30 38 49 22 33 Trading VaR $ 109 $ 69 $ 85 $ 97 $ 55 $ 73 94 Table of Contents VaR Statistics for Comparisons with Other Global Financial Services Firms. VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the breadth of products included in the VaR model, in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market factors, and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the simulated market conditions. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates for similar portfolios. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms. Table 3 below presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (99% versus 95%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four years versus one year), for market data upon which it bases its simulations: Table 3: Average 99% and 95% Trading VaRwith Four Year/One Year Historical Time Series Average 99%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2005 Average 95%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2005 Primary Market Risk Category Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 58 $ 50 $ 37 $ 33 Equity price 35 30 25 21 Foreign exchange rate 12 11 8 7 Commodity price 38 33 26 22 Trading VaR $ 85 $ 71 $ 57 $ 49 In addition, if the Company were to report Trading VaR (using a four year historical time series) with respect to a 10 day holding period, the Companys 99% and 95% Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2005 would have been $270 million and $181 million, respectively. 95 Table of Contents Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for Fiscal 2005. As shown in Table 2 above, the Companys average 99%/one day Trading VaR for fiscal 2005 was $85 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 99%/one day Trading VaR for fiscal 2005. The most frequently occurring value was between $78 million and $81 million, while for approximately 86% of trading days during the fiscal year, VaR ranged between $72 million and $99 million. One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the Companys VaR model as a measure of the Companys potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra day trading, for a 99%/one day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the fiscal year is three, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than five times in a year, the accuracy of the VaR model could be questioned. Accordingly, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results. The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenue during fiscal 2005 for the Companys trading businesses (including net interest and commissions but excluding primary and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses). There were no days during fiscal 2005 in which the Company incurred daily trading losses in excess of the 99%/one day Trading VaR for that given day. Additionally, there were no days during fiscal 2005 where the largest one day loss exceeded the lowest 99%/one day Trading VaR reported in Table 2 above. 96 Table of Contents Consumer Lending and Related Activities. Interest Rate Risk and Management. In its consumer lending activities, the Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations, as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, long term borrowings and deposits. The Companys interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Companys right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, the Company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve its objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing. Sensitivity Analysis Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. For its consumer lending activities, the Company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure, one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from its fiscal year end, the Company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. A portion of the Companys credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate, although the Company has the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate. Therefore, the Company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. The Company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles. In addition, assets that have a market based index, such as the prime rate, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or assets with 97 Table of Contents rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the Companys normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that have a market based index, such as the commercial paper or LIBOR rates, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of November 30, 2005, it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following 12 month period would be reduced by approximately $36 million. The comparable reduction of pre tax income for the 12 month period following November 30, 2004 was estimated to be approximately $60 million. The decrease in the reduction in pre tax income at November 30, 2005 was due to a higher level of variable interest rate assets. The hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next 12 month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the Company would respond to significant changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the analysis does not necessarily reflect the Companys expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur. Credit Risk. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower, counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations. The Company is exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in its businesses. The Company incurs significant, single name credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities business. This type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis. The Company incurs individual consumer credit risk in the Retail Brokerage business through margin loans to individual investors, which are generally collateralized, and loans to small businesses. The Company incurs consumer portfolio credit risk in the Discover business primarily through cardholder receivables. Credit risk in a pool of credit card receivables is generally highly diversified, without significant individual exposures, and, accordingly, is managed on a portfolio and not a single name basis. The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed discretely. The Institutional Credit Department (Institutional Credit) manages credit risk exposure for the Institutional Securities business. Institutional Credit is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure in the Retail Brokerage business is managed through various credit risk committees, whose membership includes Institutional Credit. The Retail Brokerage Risk Management Department is responsible for 98 Table of Contents monitoring, measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures, including margin loans and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions. Credit risk exposure in the Discover business is managed through the Discover Credit and Market Risk Committee, which, in turn, is supported by business line specific risk committees and the Credit Risk Management Department, which is responsible for the development, validation and implementation of credit policy criteria, for predictive models, for the monitoring of performance for both new and existing products, and for oversight of adherence to existing policies and limits. Institutional Securities Activities. Lending. In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. These loans and commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, may be secured or unsecured, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated or traded by the Company. The borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade. Credit risk with respect to loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement. Securitized Products. The Company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, corporate and operating company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value. Other. In addition to the activities performed by Institutional Credit, there are credit risks managed by various business areas within Institutional Securities. For example, certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits. Certain risk management activities as it pertains to establishing appropriate collateral amounts for the Companys prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. Derivative Contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams, exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and equity warrants typically have longer maturities. The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Companys exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities, or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Analyzing Credit Risk. Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, counterparty and portfolio levels. In order to help protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities, Institutional Credit ensures that all material lending and derivative transactions are analyzed, that the creditworthiness of the Companys counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly, and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. 99 Table of Contents Institutional Credit assigns obligor credit ratings to the Companys counterparties and borrowers. These credit ratings are intended to assess a counterpartys probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or below are considered non investment grade. Additionally, Institutional Credit assigns a facility rating to lending facilities. The facility rating incorporates the relative position of the particular obligation in the borrowers capital structure and relative recovery prospects. The Company has credit guidelines that limit potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties. Institutional Credit administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits. Risk Mitigation. The Company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments which may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign or sub participate funded loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company may enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements may provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterpartys rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default. Credit Exposure Lending. At November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004, the aggregate value of investment grade loans and financial accommodations was $5.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and the aggregate value of non investment grade loans and positions was $2.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004, the aggregate value of lending commitments outstanding was $37.0 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively. The increase from the prior year was primarily related to acquisition financing activity. In connection with these business activities (which include funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges with a notional amount of $17.8 billion and $11.6 billion at November 30, 2005 and November 30, 2004, respectively, including both internal and external hedges utilized by the lending business.

Instruments in each category can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in one or more non U.S. currencies. The fair values recorded in the above tables are determined by the Company using various pricing models. For a discussion of fair value as it affects the consolidated financial statements, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies, the structure of the transaction, including its maturity, is one of several important factors that may impact the price transparency. The impact of maturity on price transparency can differ significantly among product categories. For example, single currency and multi currency interest rate derivative products involving highly standardized terms and the major currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar or the euro) will generally have greater price transparency from published external sources even in maturity ranges beyond 20 years. Credit derivatives with highly standardized terms and liquid underlying reference instruments can have price transparency from published external sources in a maturity ranging up to 10 years, while equity and foreign exchange derivative products with standardized terms in major currencies can have price transparency from published external sources within a two year maturity range. Commodity derivatives with standardized terms and 102 Table of Contents delivery locations can have price transparency from published external sources within various maturity ranges up to 10 years, depending on the commodity. In most instances of limited price transparency based on published external sources, dealers in these markets, in their capacities as market makers and liquidity providers, provide price transparency beyond the above maturity ranges. Country Exposure. The Company monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual countries. Credit exposure to a country arises from the Companys lending activities and derivatives activities in a country. At November 30, 2005, less than 6% of the Companys total credit exposure (including loans, lending commitments and derivative contracts) was to emerging markets, and no one emerging market country accounted for more than 3% of the Companys total credit exposure. These country credit ratings are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Industry Exposure. The Company also monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual industries. At November 30, 2005, the Companys material credit exposure (including loans, lending commitments and derivative contracts) was to entities engaged in the following industries: utilities, financial institutions, energy, sovereign related entities, consumer related and chemicals. Retail Brokerage Activities. Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of all margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, possible hedging strategies. Additionally, all transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. At November 30, 2005, there were approximately $6.6 billion of customer margin loans outstanding. In addition, Retail Brokerage is engaged in commercial lending to small businesses (BusinesScapeSM) in the forms of revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and owner occupied commercial real estate mortgages. BusinesScape clients are required to submit a formal credit application, including the borrowers financial statements. Once the credit information is obtained, a comprehensive financial analysis is performed to determine proper structure, debt capacity, cash flow coverage to service debt, liquidity analysis and collateral analysis. In addition, financial reporting requirements and financial covenants are proposed and negotiated between the lender and the borrower. Consumer Lending Activities. With respect to its consumer lending activities, potential credit cardholders undergo credit reviews by the Credit Department of Discover Financial Services to establish that they meet standards of ability and willingness to pay. Credit card applications are evaluated using scoring models (statistical evaluation models) based on information obtained from applicants and credit bureaus. The Companys credit scoring systems include both industry and customized models using the Companys criteria and historical data. Each cardmembers credit line is reviewed at least annually, and actions resulting from such review may include raising or lowering a cardmembers credit line or closing the account. In addition, the Company, on a portfolio basis, performs periodic monitoring and review of consumer behavior and risk profiles. The Company also reviews the creditworthiness of prospective Discover Network merchants and conducts annual reviews of merchants, with the greatest scrutiny given to merchants with substantial sales volume, chargeback, return and discount volumes. With respect to first mortgages and second mortgages, including home equity lines of credit (mortgage lending), a loan evaluation process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting policies and collateral valuation. The Companys underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis of applicable industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., FICO scores), debt ratios and reserves of the borrower. Loan to collateral value ratios are determined based on independent third party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. As part of the mortgage lending business strategy, almost all loans 103 Table of Contents are sold in the secondary market through securitizations and whole loan sales, while almost all servicing rights are retained. These sales and securitizations pass the risk of credit loss onto the purchaser/investor. For further information on the Companys consumer loans, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Operational Risk. Operational risk refers to the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and or systems. Operational risk also refers to the risk that external events, such as external changes (e.g., natural disasters, terrorist acts and or health epidemics), failures or frauds, will result in losses to the Companys businesses. The Company incurs operational risk across all of its business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and support functions (e.g., information technology and facilities management). Legal and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under Legal Risk. During fiscal 2005, the Company appointed a firm wide Operational Risk Manager to oversee and monitor operational risk across the Company. The Operational Risk Manager, supported by the Operational Risk Department, is responsible for facilitating, designing, implementing and monitoring the firmwide operational risk program. The Operational Risk Department works with the business segments and Control Groups and other supporting functions to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Company. Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with the business segments and supporting functions. Each business segment has a designated operational risk manager. In addition, business segment risk committees review operational risk matters and or reports on a regular basis. Each Control Group and supporting function also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a regular forum for discussing operational risk matters and or reports with senior management. Oversight of business segment operational risk is provided by business segment risk committees and ultimately senior management through the Firm Risk Committee. The business segments maintain controls designed to manage and mitigate operational risk for existing activities. In addition, as new products and business activities are developed and as processes are designed and modified, new operational risks are identified and control requirements defined to mitigate the identified risks. Operational risk controls relate to the full range of operational risk categories as defined by Basel II and include controls to mitigate risk relating to (i) theft and fraud; (ii) people; (iii) clients, products and business practices; (iv) technology; (v) physical assets and data security; (vi) transaction processing; (vii) financial and reporting; and (viii) external providers. The Company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify, assess, manage and control or mitigate operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, the Companys securities businesses have procedures that require: that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the Companys books and that records are confirmed on a timely basis; that position valuations are subject to independent review procedures; and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances. With respect to its asset management activities, the Company manages operational risk related to its various data processing systems through, among other things, internal controls such as reconciliations and various backup procedures. With respect to its consumer lending activities, the Company manages operational risk through its system of internal controls that provides checks and balances to ensure that transactions and other account related activity (e.g., new account solicitation, transaction authorization and processing, billing and collection of delinquent accounts) are properly approved, processed, recorded and reconciled. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a Company wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of the Companys disaster recovery plans include: crisis management; data and applications recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis training and testing. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computer and other assets from unauthorized access. Through 104 Table of Contents organizations promoting information security, such as the Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center and various other resources focused on information security, the Company continues to enhance its ability to detect and defend against cyber threats. The Company also utilizes the services of various external vendors that provide services in connection with the Companys ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of means, including service level and other contractual agreements, service and quality reviews, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the future. Legal Risk. Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Law Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Companys policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, collection activities, money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company. 105 Table of Contents
