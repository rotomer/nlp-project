Economic capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators, rating agencies and the market. The Companys methodology is based on an approach that assigns economic capital to each segment based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses, goodwill and intangible assets, and principal investment risk. The economic capital model and allocation methodology may be enhanced over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment. The effective tax rates used in the computation of segment return on average common equity were determined on a separate entity basis. (5) Amounts include assets under management or supervision associated with the Global Wealth Management Group business segment. (6) Revenues and expenses associated with these assets are included in the Companys Asset Management, Global Wealth Management Group and Institutional Securities business segments.

Company Results. The Company recorded net income of $7,472 million in fiscal 2006, a 51% increase from $4,939 million in the prior year. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the provision for loan losses) rose 26% to a record $33,858 million in fiscal 2006, and non interest expenses increased 18% to $22,858 million. Diluted earnings per share were $7.07 compared with $4.57 a year ago. Compensation and benefits expense increased 27%, primarily reflecting higher net revenues. Non compensation expenses increased 5% as costs associated with higher levels of business activity were partially offset by lower charges for legal and regulatory matters. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $7.09 compared with $4.81 last year. The return on average common equity in fiscal 2006 was 23.5% compared with 17.3% in the prior year. The return on average common equity from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was 23.6% compared with 19.0% last year. Results for fiscal 2006 included non cash incremental compensation expenses of approximately $270 million for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees (see Other Items Stock Based Compensation herein). Results for fiscal 2005 included a charge of $509 million ($316 million after tax) for discontinued operations related to the sale of the aircraft leasing business (see Other Items Discontinued Operations herein). In addition, pre tax results for fiscal 2005 included a $360 million charge related to the Coleman Litigation, legal accruals of approximately $120 million related to the Parmalat matter, a $109 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases, charges for senior management severance and new hires of approximately $311 million, and a gain of $251 million related to an insurance settlement (see Other Items herein). The Companys effective income tax rate was 30.4% in fiscal 2006 compared with 26.5% in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006s income tax provision included an income tax benefit of $280 million resulting from the resolution of a federal tax audit, while fiscal 2005s income tax provision included an income tax benefit of $309 million related to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (see Other Items herein). Excluding the benefits from the federal tax audit and the American Jobs Creation Act, the Companys effective income tax rates in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 would have been 33.0% and 30.8%, respectively. The increase primarily reflected lower estimated domestic tax credits and higher earnings, which reduced the effect of permanent differences, partially offset by the effects of lower tax rates applicable to non U.S. earnings. At fiscal year end, the Company had 55,310 employees worldwide compared with 53,218 at the prior year end. Institutional Securities. Institutional Securities recorded income from continuing operations before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $8,160 million, a 72% increase from a year ago. Net revenues rose 38% to $21,562 million driven by record results in fixed income and equity sales and trading and fixed income underwriting, along with strong results in advisory revenues. Non interest expenses increased 23% to $13,402 million, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense resulting from higher net revenues. Non compensation expenses were relatively unchanged as higher costs associated with higher levels of business activity were offset by lower charges for legal and regulatory matters. Investment banking revenues rose 24% from last year to $4,318 million. Underwriting revenues rose 24% from last year to $2,475 million. Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,843 million, an increase of 25% from fiscal 2005. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were a record $9,577 million, up 41% from a year ago. The increase was driven by record results from commodities, credit products, and interest rate and currency products. Commodities revenues reflected strong results from electricity, natural gas products and oil liquids. Credit product revenues benefited from significantly improved corporate credit trading and strength in residential and commercial securitized products. Commodities and interest rate and currency products benefited from revenues recognized on structured transactions as a result of increased observability of market value (see Other Items Accounting Developments Fair Value Measurements herein). Equity sales and trading revenues were a record $6,320 million, up 32% from a year ago. The increase was broad based and included higher revenues from derivatives and equity cash products, financing products, prime brokerage and principal trading strategies. 39 Table of Contents Principal transaction net investment revenues increased 125% to $1,477 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006s results primarily related to net gains associated with the Companys investments, including both realized and unrealized gains from investments in the Companys real estate funds, IntercontinentalExchange, Grifols S.A., the NYSE Group, Inc. (the NYSE) and Wacker Chemie AG. Global Wealth Management Group. Global Wealth Management Group recorded income before taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $509 million, down 13% from the prior year. Fiscal 2005 included a benefit of $198 million resulting from the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see Other Items Insurance Settlement herein), partially offset by a $29 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases (see Other Items Lease Adjustment herein). Net revenues were $5,505 million, a 10% increase over a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue from the bank deposit program and an increase in revenues from fee based products. Total non interest expenses were $4,996 million, a 13% increase from a year ago. Excluding the insurance settlement and the lease adjustment, total non interest expenses increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits expense resulting from higher net revenues, partially offset by lower non compensation expenses due to lower charges for legal and regulatory costs. Total client assets increased to $686 billion, up 11% from the prior fiscal year end. In addition, client assets in fee based accounts increased 19% from a year ago to a record $206 billion and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 30% from last years 28%. At fiscal year end, the number of global representatives was 8,030, a decline of 1,496 from a year ago, resulting largely from planned sales force reductions completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and attrition. Asset Management. Asset Management recorded income before taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $711 million, a 29% decrease from last year. Net revenues of $2,770 million decreased 5% from the prior year, largely due to lower investment revenues, primarily in the private equity business. Principal transaction net investment gains for the year were $139 million compared with $326 million a year ago. Non interest expenses increased 8% from the prior year to $2,059 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits expense associated with critical business initiatives to retain and attract new talent in the business and support areas. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management of $478 billion were up $47 billion, or 11%, from last year, primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of customer assets. In fiscal 2007, the Company expects that Asset Managements profit margins will be affected by its continued investments in its core business, alternative products and private equity. Discover. Discover recorded record income before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes and net cumulative effect of accounting change of $1,587 million, an increase of 72% from last year. Net revenues of $4,290 million were 24% higher than a year ago, benefiting from improvements in credit quality and a continued favorable impact on charge offs following the enactment of federal bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005. Servicing and securitization income of $2,338 million increased 45% from a year ago due primarily to a lower Provision for consumer loan losses and higher Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net. The increase also reflected higher Other revenues, which was attributable to an increase in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in securitized receivables. Non interest expenses of $2,703 million increased 7% from the prior year, primarily due to costs associated with the Goldfish acquisition (see Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein), higher compensation and benefits expense and higher legal costs. In fiscal 2006, Discovers results benefited from the continued favorable credit environment. In fiscal 2007, the Company expects Discovers margins to return to more normal levels. The managed credit card net principal charge off rate decreased 115 basis points from a year ago to 4.08%. The managed over 30 day delinquency rate decreased 47 basis points to 3.51% from a year ago, and the managed over 90 day delinquency rate was 10 basis points lower than a year ago at 1.65%. Managed credit card loans were $50,291 million at year end, a 7% increase from a year ago. Global Market and Economic Conditions in Fiscal 2006. Global market and economic conditions were generally favorable throughout most of fiscal 2006, which contributed to the increased revenues and net income achieved by the Company during the fiscal year. Although 40 Table of Contents there were concerns about energy prices, inflation and geopolitical risks, activity in the global capital markets was robust, and the volume of merger and acquisition and underwriting transactions increased from the prior year. The U.S. economy continued to demonstrate strength during fiscal 2006. The rate of economic growth was generally strong, although it moderated during the second half of the fiscal year as consumer spending was affected by higher energy prices and a slowdown in the residential real estate market. The U.S. unemployment rate declined to 4.5% from 5.0% at the end of the prior fiscal year. Conditions in the U.S. equity markets were also generally favorable during fiscal 2006. Major equity market indices increased despite experiencing a correction during the summer as the favorable economic environment and strong corporate earnings outweighed concerns about inflation, energy prices and rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) raised both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate by an aggregate of 1.25% in fiscal 2006. The Fed held interest rates steady after the end of June, however, as there were indications that inflationary pressures had subsided. In Europe, economic growth continued at a moderate pace during fiscal 2006, primarily driven by domestic demand and exports. Major equity market indices in Europe increased during the year, reflecting strong corporate profits, merger and acquisition activity, and favorable economic conditions. The European Central Bank (the ECB) raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 1.25% during fiscal 2006. In December 2006, the ECB raised the benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.25%. Economic growth also continued in the U.K., supported by domestic demand and business investment. The Bank of England (the BOE) raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 0.50% during fiscal 2006. In January 2007, the BOE raised the benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.25%. In Japan, economic growth continued to be driven by domestic demand and exports. The level of unemployment also remained relatively low, and Japanese equity market indices increased during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2006, the Bank of Japan raised the benchmark interest rate from 0.0% to 0.25%. Economies elsewhere in Asia also expanded, particularly in China, which benefited from strength in exports, domestic demand and continued globalization. Equity market indices in China increased sharply during the year. In fiscal 2006, the Peoples Bank of China raised the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 0.54%. Business Segments. The remainder of Results of Operations is presented on a business segment basis before discontinued operations. Substantially all of the Companys operating revenues and operating expenses can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures. As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations primarily represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by Asset Management to Global Wealth Management Group associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to Global Wealth Management Groups global representatives. Income before taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations was $33 million, $94 million and $118 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. In addition, the results in Institutional Securities for fiscal 2006 included a $30 million advisory fee related to the Companys sale of the aircraft leasing business that was eliminated in consolidation. 41 Table of Contents INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal2004 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 4,318 $ 3,477 $ 3,008 Principal transactions: Trading 11,272 6,906 4,998 Investments 1,477 656 364 Commissions 2,606 2,160 1,998 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 259 152 144 Interest and dividends 41,979 25,455 16,395 Other 404 301 190 Total revenues 62,315 39,107 27,097 Interest expense 40,753 23,434 13,984 Net revenues 21,562 15,673 13,113 Total non interest expenses 13,402 10,919 8,832 Income from continuing operations before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes, dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption and cumulative effect of accounting change, net 8,160 4,754 4,281 Losses from unconsolidated investees 225 311 328 Provision for income taxes 2,308 909 932 Dividends on preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 45 Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change, net $ 5,627 $ 3,534 $ 2,976 Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues are derived from the underwriting of securities offerings and fees from advisory services. Investment banking revenues were as follows: Fiscal2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal2004 (dollars in millions) Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions $ 1,843 $ 1,478 $ 1,156 Equity underwriting revenues 1,059 905 993 Fixed income underwriting revenues 1,416 1,094 859 Total investment banking revenues $ 4,318 $ 3,477 $ 3,008 Investment banking revenues increased 24% in fiscal 2006. The increase was due to higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring activities and fixed income and equity underwriting transactions. In fiscal 2005, investment banking revenues increased 16%, primarily reflecting higher revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring activities and fixed income underwriting transactions, partially offset by lower revenues from equity underwritings. In fiscal 2006, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 25% to $1,843 million. Advisory fees in fiscal 2006 reflected certain internal revenues, including a $30 million fee related to the Companys sale of the aircraft leasing business that was eliminated in consolidation. In fiscal 2005, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 28% to $1,478 million. The results in both fiscal years reflected a strong volume of transaction activity as conditions in the worldwide merger and acquisition markets were generally favorable throughout both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. 42 Table of Contents Equity underwriting revenues increased 17% to $1,059 million in fiscal 2006 and reflected higher global industry wide equity and equity related activity, most notably relating to a strong volume of initial public offerings. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 9% to $905 million in fiscal 2005, reflective of lower global industry wide equity and equity related activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues rose 29% to a record $1,416 million in fiscal 2006 and increased 27% to $1,094 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase in underwriting revenues from non investment grade and investment grade products as the level of issuer refinancings rose due to record levels of maturing debt. The increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher revenues from global high yield and securitized fixed income transactions. Acquisition related financing resulting from a strong market for merger and acquisition activity contributed to the increases in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Both fiscal years also reflected generally favorable conditions in the global fixed income markets, and, although the Fed increased the overnight interest rate in both fiscal years, longer term interest rates remained at relatively low levels. The attractive debt financing environment contributed to higher revenues as issuers continued to take advantage of relatively low financing costs. At the end of fiscal 2006, the backlog of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions and equity and fixed income underwriting transactions was higher as compared with the end of fiscal 2005. The backlog of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions and equity and fixed income underwriting transactions is subject to the risk that transactions may not be completed due to unforeseen economic and market conditions, adverse developments regarding one of the parties to the transaction, a failure to obtain required regulatory approval or a decision on the part of the parties involved not to pursue a transaction. Sales and Trading Revenues. Sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transaction trading revenues, commissions and net interest revenues (expenses). In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views principal trading, commissions and net interest revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions and other related expenses. The components of the Companys sales and trading revenues are described below: Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transaction trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions. The Company also engages in proprietary trading activities for its own account. Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over the counter (OTC) equity securities and options. Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions. Total sales and trading revenues increased 36% in fiscal 2006 and 18% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both periods reflected higher fixed income and equity sales and trading revenues. 43 Table of Contents Sales and trading revenues included the following: Fiscal2006(1) Fiscal2005(1) Fiscal2004(1) (dollars in millions) Equity $ 6,320 $ 4,804 $ 4,067 Fixed income(2) 9,577 6,782 5,567 (1) Amounts exclude sales and trading revenues of $(793) million, $(499) million and $(227) million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively, which relate to unallocated net revenues, net revenues associated with corporate lending activities and certain other adjustments. (2) Amounts include interest rate and currency products, credit products and commodities. Amounts exclude corporate lending activities. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 32% to a record $6,320 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was broad based and included higher revenues from derivatives and equity cash products, financing products, prime brokerage and principal trading strategies. Derivative revenues increased due to strong customer flows, although volatility in the global equity markets continued to be generally low. Revenues from equity cash products reflected higher market volumes, particularly in Europe and Asia. Financing products revenues also benefited from increased client activity. Prime brokerage generated record revenues for the third consecutive fiscal year, reflecting continued growth in global client asset balances. Global equity markets generally trended higher and created favorable opportunities for principal trading strategies. Although commission revenues increased, revenues continued to be affected by intense competition, particularly in the U.S., and a continued shift toward electronic trading. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 18% in fiscal 2005. The increase was broad based and included increased customer flows in derivatives, higher revenues in prime brokerage, improved performance in principal trading strategies and higher revenues from equity cash products. Derivative revenues increased due to strong customer flows despite continued low levels of volatility in the equity markets. Revenues in prime brokerage were driven by robust growth in client balances. Global equity markets generally trended higher and created favorable trading opportunities for principal trading strategies. Revenue from equity cash products rose on higher market volumes, particularly in the European and Asian markets. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 41% to a record $9,577 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by record results from commodities, credit products, and interest rate and currency products. Commodities revenues increased 112% due to strong results from electricity, natural gas products and oil liquids. Credit product revenues increased 46%, primarily due to significantly improved corporate credit trading and strength in residential and commercial securitized products. Interest rate and currency products increased 4%. Both commodity and interest rate and currency products benefited from revenues recognized on structured transactions as a result of increased observability of market value in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF Issue No. 02 3). With the adoption of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) on December 1, 2006, the Company will no longer apply the revenue recognition criteria of EITF Issue No. 02 3 (see Other Items Accounting Developments Fair Value Measurements herein). Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 22% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher revenues from interest rate and currency and credit products, partially offset by lower revenues from commodities products. Interest rate and currency product revenues increased 41% primarily due to higher revenues from interest rate cash and derivative products and higher revenues from emerging market fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from foreign exchange products. Interest rate and currency product revenues benefited from strong new client transaction activity and favorable positioning results. The 19% increase in credit product revenues was primarily due to increased customer flows in securitized products and favorable trading conditions. Commodities revenues decreased 8% from the prior year as lower revenues in oil liquids were partially offset by record results in electricity and natural gas products. 44 Table of Contents In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues include the net revenues from the Companys corporate lending activities. In fiscal 2006, revenues from corporate lending activities decreased by approximately $50 million from the prior year. In fiscal 2005, revenues from corporate lending activities decreased by approximately $240 million. In both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, revenues from corporate lending activities reflected the impact of mark to market valuations on a higher level of new loans made in both fiscal years. Principal Transactions Investments. The Companys investments generally are held for appreciation and to facilitate other business activities. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. Principal transaction net investment revenues aggregating $1,477 million were recognized in fiscal 2006 as compared with $656 million in fiscal 2005 and $364 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily related to net gains associated with the Companys investments, including both realized and unrealized gains from investments in the Companys real estate funds, IntercontinentalExchange, Grifols S.A., the NYSE and Wacker Chemie AG. Fiscal 2005s results included gains from investments in IntercontinentalExchange, International Securities Exchange and Digital Globe Inc. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from asset management services, primarily fees associated with the Companys real estate fund investment activities. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 70% in fiscal 2006 and 6% in fiscal 2005.

(Barra). Other revenues also include revenues related to the operation of pipelines, terminals and barges and the distribution of refined petroleum products associated with TransMontaigne Inc. (TransMontaigne) and the marine transportation and logistics services associated with the Heidmar Group (see Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein). Other revenues increased 34% in fiscal 2006 and 58% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to higher sales of benchmark indices and risk management analytic products. The increase in fiscal 2006 was also partly attributable to revenues associated with TransMontaigne, which was acquired on September 1, 2006. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 23% in fiscal 2006. Compensation and benefits expense increased 36%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs resulting from higher net revenues. Fiscal 2006 also included Institutional Securities share ($190 million) of incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement eligible employees (see Other Items Stock Based Compensation herein), while fiscal 2005 included Institutional Securities share ($193 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see Other Items Senior Management Compensation Charges herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses remained relatively unchanged. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 6%, primarily due to a $71 million charge that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases (see Other Items Lease Adjustment herein). Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 32%, primarily reflecting increased equity and fixed income trading activity.

The increase also included a $71 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 14%, primarily reflecting increased trading activity. Information processing and communications expense increased 11%, primarily due to higher telecommunications, market data and data processing costs. Professional services expense increased 31%, primarily due to higher consulting and legal costs, including costs of $55 million related to the matters below. Other expenses increased 71%, reflecting legal accruals of $360 million related to the Coleman Litigation, approximately $170 million related to the Parmalat settlement and the IPO Allocation Matters, while fiscal 2004 included legal accruals of $110 million related to the Parmalat settlement and the IPO Allocation Matters. 46 Table of Contents GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 428 $ 320 $ 290 Principal transactions: Trading 474 464 518 Investments 53 (1 ) (5 ) Commissions 1,208 1,228 1,327 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,693 2,517 2,099 Interest and dividends 1,018 662 409 Other 155 167 133 Total revenues 6,029 5,357 4,771 Interest expense 524 338 156 Net revenues 5,505 5,019 4,615 Total non interest expenses 4,996 4,434 4,244 Income before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, net 509 585 371 Provision for income taxes 164 197 120 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, net $ 345 $ 388 $ 251 The revenues and expenses discussed below include the results of Quilter Holdings Ltd.

The impact of Quilter to the Global Wealth Management Groups operating results for all periods presented was not material. Investment Banking. Global Wealth Management Group investment banking includes revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed end funds and unit trusts. Revenues also include fees earned from offerings underwritten by the Institutional Securities business. Investment banking revenues increased 34% and 10% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher revenues from equity related offerings and unit trust products. The increase in fiscal 2005 was partially offset by lower revenues from fixed income underwritings. Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transactions include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys inventory positions held, primarily to facilitate customer transactions. Principal transaction trading revenues increased 2% in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting higher revenue from foreign exchange products, equity linked notes and municipal fixed income securities, partially offset by lower revenues from corporate and government fixed income products and other securities. In fiscal 2005, principal transaction trading revenues decreased 10%, primarily due to lower customer transaction activity in corporate, government and municipal fixed income securities. Principal TransactionsInvestments. Principal transaction net investment revenues were $53 million in fiscal 2006 compared with a net loss of $(1) million in fiscal 2005 and a net loss of $(5) million in fiscal 2004. The results in fiscal 2006 were primarily related to realized and unrealized gains on the Companys investments in Bolsas y Mercados Espa&ntilde;oles (BME) and the NYSE. 47 Table of Contents Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commission revenues decreased 2% and 7% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The decrease in both fiscal years largely reflected lower revenues from equity products, which was related to lower agency activity with customers due, in part, to growth in other product areas, including investment banking and asset management. Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including customer bank deposits and margin loans and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions. Net interest revenues increased 52% and 28% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased customer account balances in the bank deposit program that was launched in November 2005. Balances in the bank deposit program rose to $13,301 million at November 30, 2006 from $1,689 million at November 30, 2005. The increase in net interest income in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to growth in customer margin balances. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from individual investors electing a fee based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management, account services and administration. The Company also receives fees for services it provides in distributing certain open ended mutual funds and other products. Mutual fund distribution fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 7% in fiscal 2006 and 20% in fiscal 2005. In both fiscal years, the increase was driven by higher client asset balances in fee based accounts. Client assets in fee based accounts rose 19% to $206 billion at November 30, 2006 and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 30% of total client assets from 28% in the prior year. Client assets in fee based accounts rose 10% to $173 billion at November 30, 2005 and increased as a percentage of total client assets to 28% of total client assets from 26% in the prior year. Client asset balances increased to $686 billion at November 30, 2006 from $617 billion at November 30, 2005, primarily due to market appreciation. Client asset balances in accounts greater than $1 million increased to $450 billion at November 30, 2006 from $375 billion at November 30, 2005. Other. Other revenues primarily include customer account service fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues decreased 7% in fiscal 2006 and increased 26% in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, the decrease primarily reflected lower service fees. In fiscal 2005, the increase was primarily due to higher service fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 13% in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 included a reduction in non interest expenses related to Global Wealth Management Groups share ($198 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see Other Items Insurance Settlement herein).

Excluding compensation and benefits expense and the insurance settlement, non interest expenses decreased 4%. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased 5%, primarily due to a $29 million charge for the correction in the method of accounting for certain real estate leases that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 (see Other Items Lease Adjustment herein). Professional services expense increased 17%, largely due to higher sub advisory fees associated with growth in fee based assets and higher costs for outside legal counsel. Other expenses decreased 21%, primarily resulting from lower costs 48 Table of Contents associated with legal and regulatory matters. During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the Company recorded legal and regulatory expenses of approximately $105 million and $170 million, respectively, related to ongoing regulatory, employment and branch litigation matters.

In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded legal and regulatory expenses of approximately $170 million, primarily related to employment matters and certain regulatory and branch litigation matters. 49 Table of Contents ASSET MANAGEMENT INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 48 $ 50 $ 43 Principal transactions: Investments 139 326 248 Commissions 25 29 27 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,504 2,460 2,390 Interest and dividends 45 23 8 Other 23 30 28 Total revenues 2,784 2,918 2,744 Interest expense 14 11 6 Net revenues 2,770 2,907 2,738 Total non interest expenses 2,059 1,900 1,911 Income before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, net 711 1,007 827 Provision for income taxes 285 378 318 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, net $ 426 $ 629 $ 509 Investment Banking. Asset Management generates investment banking revenues primarily from the underwriting of unit trust products. Investment banking revenues decreased 4% in fiscal 2006 and increased 16% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a lower volume of fixed income unit trust sales, partially offset by higher equity unit trust sales, which generate lower revenues in comparison with fixed income unit trust sales. The increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a higher volume of unit trust sales. Unit trust sales volume increased 20% to $7.3 billion in fiscal 2006 and increased 11% to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2005. Principal Transactions Investments. Asset Management principal transaction investment revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on investments associated with the Companys private equity activities and capital investments in certain of the Companys investment funds, primarily in alternative products. Principal transaction net investment gains aggregating $139 million were recognized in fiscal 2006 as compared with $326 million in fiscal 2005. The results in both fiscal years primarily reflected net investment gains on certain investments in the Companys private equity portfolio, including Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings, LLC. Fiscal 2005s results also included a net investment gain on Triana Energy Holdings, LLC. Private equity investments generally are held for appreciation. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. Commissions. Asset Management primarily generates commission revenues from dealer and distribution concessions on sales of certain funds. Commission revenues decreased 14% in fiscal 2006 and increased 7% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a decrease in commissionable sales of certain fund products, while fiscal 2005 reflected an increase in such commissionable sales. 50 Table of Contents Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.

Net outflows (excluding money markets) in fiscal 2006 were primarily associated with the Companys U.S. Institutional products and Americas Retail Morgan Stanley branded products, partially offset by positive flows into Americas Intermediary products. For fiscal 2006, positive flows into institutional liquidity assets were offset by outflows from certain money market funds that were impacted by the growth of the Global Wealth Management Groups bank deposit program. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 2% in fiscal 2006 and 3% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both periods was due to higher management and administration fees, partially offset by lower distribution fees. The higher management and administration fees in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were associated with increases in average assets under management of 5% and 9%, respectively. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 8% in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 included a reduction in non interest expenses from Asset Managements share ($43 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001 (see Other Items Insurance Settlement herein). Compensation and benefits expense increased 22% in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs as well as the impact of new hires. In addition, fiscal 2006 included Asset Managements share ($20 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement eligible employees (see Other Items Stock Based Compensation herein), while fiscal 2005 included Asset Managements share ($41 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see Other Items Senior Management Compensation Charges herein). Excluding compensation and benefits expense and the insurance settlement, non interest expenses decreased 4%. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 14%, primarily reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open ended funds. Marketing and business development expense increased 11%, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing costs. 52 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005s total non interest expenses decreased 1%, including Asset Managements share ($43 million) of the insurance settlement related to the events of September 11, 2001. Excluding the insurance settlement, non interest expenses increased 2%. Compensation and benefits expense increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation costs due to higher net revenues and Asset Managements share ($41 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 7%, primarily reflecting lower amortization expense associated with certain open ended funds. The decrease in amortization expense reflected a lower level of deferred costs in recent periods due to a decrease in sales of certain open ended funds. Marketing and business development expense increased 19%, primarily due to higher promotional costs associated with the Companys Van Kampen products. Professional services expense increased 6% due to higher sub advisory fees, partially offset by lower legal and consulting fees. Other expenses decreased 20%, primarily due to a reduction in legal reserves resulting from the resolution of certain legal matters, partially offset by higher insurance expense. 53 Table of Contents DISCOVER INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 (dollars in millions) Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net $ 1,167 $ 1,323 $ 1,317 Servicing and securitization income 2,338 1,609 1,921 Other revenue 35 5 10 Total non interest revenues 3,540 2,937 3,248 Interest revenue 2,458 2,174 1,859 Interest expense 952 781 648 Net interest income 1,506 1,393 1,211 Provision for consumer loan losses 756 878 926 Net credit income 750 515 285 Net revenues 4,290 3,452 3,533 Total non interest expenses 2,703 2,531 2,312 Income before losses from unconsolidated investees, income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, net 1,587 921 1,221 Losses from unconsolidated investees 3 Provision for income taxes 506 340 443 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change, net $ 1,078 $ 581 $ 778 On December 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved the spin off of Discover (see Other Items Discover Spin off herein). Merchant, Cardmember and Other Fees, Net. Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, include revenues from fees charged to merchants on credit card sales (net of interchange fees paid to banks that issue cards on the Companys merchant and cash access network), transaction processing fees on debit card transactions as well as charges to cardmembers for late payment fees, overlimit fees, balance transfer fees, credit protection fees and cash advance fees, net of cardmember rewards. Cardmember rewards include various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus&reg; reward program, pursuant to which the Company pays certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based upon a cardmembers level and type of purchases. In fiscal 2006, Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, decreased 12%, primarily due to higher cardmember rewards and lower merchant discount revenues, partially offset by higher cardmember and other fees. The increase in cardmember rewards reflected record sales volume and the impact of promotional programs. The decrease in merchant discount revenues was due to higher allocations of interchange revenue to securitization transactions, partially offset by record sales volume. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, the Company allocated interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which has the effect of decreasing Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, and increasing Servicing and securitization income. During fiscal 2006, the Company had a higher level of outstanding securitization transactions receiving interchange revenue allocations than in the prior year. The increase in sales volume reflected increased cardmember usage and the acquisition of Goldfish in February 2006 (see Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein). The increase in cardmember and other fees was primarily related to higher balance transfer fees, lower fee net charge offs and higher credit protection fees. In fiscal 2005, Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, were relatively unchanged as higher transaction processing revenues were offset by higher net cardmember rewards. The increase in transaction processing 54 Table of Contents revenues was related to the acquisition of PULSE on January 12, 2005 (see Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein). The increase in net cardmember rewards reflected record sales volume and the impact of promotional programs. Servicing and Securitization Income. Servicing and securitization income is revenue derived from consumer loans that have been sold to investors through asset securitizations. Cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized general purpose credit card loans as well as interchange fees for certain securitization transactions are used to pay investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans and to pay the Company a fee for servicing the loans (servicing rights). Any excess cash flows remaining (excess servicing rights) are paid to the Company. The sale of general purpose credit card loans through asset securitizations, therefore, has the effect of converting portions of net credit income and fee income to servicing and securitization income. Included in Servicing and securitization income are revenues from servicing rights, excess servicing rights and gains or losses on general purpose credit card asset securitizations as well as the change in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in general purpose credit card asset securitizations. The table below presents the components of Servicing and securitization income: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 (dollars in millions) Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net $ 1,014 $ 694 $ 650 Other revenue 159 (78 ) (8 ) Total non interest revenues 1,173 616 642 Interest revenue 3,709 3,530 3,842 Interest expense 1,398 1,025 692 Net interest income 2,311 2,505 3,150 Provision for consumer loan losses 1,146 1,512 1,871 Net credit income 1,165 993 1,279 Servicing and securitization income $ 2,338 $ 1,609 $ 1,921 Servicing and securitization income is affected by the level of securitized loans, the spread between the net interest yield on the securitized loans and the yield paid to the investors, the rate of credit losses on securitized loans and the level of merchant, cardmember and other fees earned. The Other revenue component of Servicing and securitization income includes net securitization gains and losses on general purpose credit card loans and the change in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in general purpose credit card asset securitizations. Servicing and securitization income increased 45% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to a lower Provision for consumer loan losses, higher Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, and higher Other revenue, partially offset by lower net interest revenues. The lower Provision for consumer loan losses was primarily attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a lower rate of net principal charge offs on the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio. The increase in Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, primarily reflected a higher level of outstanding securitization transactions that received interchange revenues. The increase in Other revenue was attributable to an increase in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in securitized receivables, primarily resulting from a continued favorable impact on charge offs following the enactment of federal bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005. The increase in Other revenue also reflected higher levels of general purpose credit card securitization transactions and a decrease in 55 Table of Contents net gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions. The decrease in net interest revenues was primarily attributable to a lower net interest spread and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. In fiscal 2005, Servicing and securitization income decreased 16%, reflecting lower net interest revenues and Other revenue, partially offset by a lower Provision for consumer loan losses and higher Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net. The decrease in net interest revenues was attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a higher weighted average coupon rate paid to investors associated with the higher short term interest rate environment. The interest yield was relatively unchanged from fiscal 2004 as the impact of the increase in the prime rate was offset by a decline in higher rate loans due to improved credit quality and various pricing initiatives. The decrease in Other revenue was primarily due to a lower level of securitized receivables and a decline in the fair value of the Companys retained interests in securitized receivables as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications and its impact on future charge offs. The lower Provision for consumer loan losses was primarily attributable to a lower rate of net principal charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans, partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charge offs. The increase in Merchant, cardmember and other fees, net, reflected the allocation of interchange revenue to certain securitization transactions and lower fee net charge offs, partially offset by lower assessed late payment and overlimit fees. The net proceeds received from general purpose credit card asset securitizations were $8,738 million in fiscal 2006 and $7,240 million in fiscal 2005. The credit card asset securitization transactions completed in fiscal 2006 have expected maturities ranging from approximately three to seven years from the date of issuance. Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest revenue derived from consumer loans and short term investment assets and interest expense incurred to finance those loans and assets. Assets, consisting primarily of consumer loans, currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market indexed variable rates. The Company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates. Interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the Company as part of its interest rate risk management program. This program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Companys right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. Net interest income increased 8% in fiscal 2006 due to an increase in Interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in Interest expense. The increase in Interest revenue was due to an increase in average owned general purpose credit card loans and a higher interest yield. The increase in average owned general purpose credit card loans was due to the acquisition of Goldfish, record sales volume and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans. The increase in Interest expense was primarily related to an increase in the Companys average cost of borrowings and a higher level of average interest bearing liabilities, primarily to support the increase in average owned general purpose credit card loans. Net interest income increased 15% in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in Interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in Interest expense. The increase in Interest revenue was primarily due to an increase in average general purpose credit card loans, which was partly attributable to a higher level of securitization maturities and the deferment of new securitization transactions due to the exploration of the potential spin off of Discover in fiscal 2005. The increase in Interest expense was largely due to a higher level of average interest bearing liabilities, primarily to support the increase in average general purpose credit card loans. 56 Table of Contents The following tables present analyses of Discovers average balance sheets and interest rates in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and changes in net interest income during those fiscal years: Average Balance Sheet Analysis.

The Provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the Company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the owned consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio. The allowance is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the Provision for consumer loan losses. In estimating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact credit losses, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. The Companys provision for consumer loan losses was $756 million, $878 million and $926 million for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The Companys allowance for consumer loan losses was $831 million at November 30, 2006 and $838 million at November 30, 2005. The provision for consumer loan losses decreased 14% in fiscal 2006. The decrease reflected lower net charge offs and a lower net reduction of reserves as compared with the prior year. The decrease in net charge offs primarily reflected a decline in bankruptcy filings following the federal bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005 and improved portfolio credit quality. The net reduction in reserves in fiscal 2006 was approximately $71 million as compared with approximately $100 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2005, the provision for consumer loan losses decreased 5%, primarily due to a higher net reduction of reserves and lower net charge offs as compared with fiscal 2004 due to improvement in credit quality in the 58 Table of Contents Companys consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by the impact of higher bankruptcy filings in advance of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005. The net reduction in reserves in fiscal 2005 totaled approximately $100 million as compared with a net reduction of approximately $60 million in fiscal 2004. Delinquencies and Charge offs. General purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when contractual payments become 30 days past due. General purpose credit card loans generally are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies, probate accounts and fraudulent transactions. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day contractual time frame. Fraudulent transactions are reported in consumer loans at their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of the fraud through a charge to operating expenses and are subsequently written off at the end of the month 90 days following notification but not later than the contractual 180 day time frame. Loan delinquencies and charge offs are affected by changes in economic conditions, account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors. Delinquency rates in both the over 30 day and over 90 day categories and net principal charge off rates were lower for both the owned and managed portfolios in fiscal 2006, reflecting strong portfolio credit quality and the continued favorable impact following federal bankruptcy legislation effective in fiscal 2005 (see Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data herein). While credit costs are expected to continue to rise, the Company expects charge off rates to remain relatively low and reach between 4.5% and 5.0% by the end of fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2005, delinquency rates in both the over 30 day and over 90 day categories and net principal charge off rates were lower for both the owned and managed portfolios, reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality (see Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data herein). The improvement in net principal charge off rates was partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charges offs related to consumers filing for bankruptcy in advance of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation effective in October 2005. In response to industry wide regulatory guidance, the Company has increased minimum payment requirements on certain general purpose credit card loans. Bank regulators have discretion to interpret the guidance or its application, and changes in such guidance or its application by the regulators could impact minimum payment requirements. Increases in minimum payment requirements could negatively impact future levels of general purpose credit card loans and related interest and fee revenue and charge offs. The Companys future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above. Factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new guidance, the seasoning of the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and the rate and magnitude of changes in the Companys general purpose credit card loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2006. Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% and included Discovers share ($10 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement eligible employees (see Other Items Stock Based Compensation herein) as well as an increase in salaries and wages. Fiscal 2005 included Discovers share ($29 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes (see Other Items Senior Management Compensation Charges herein). Information processing and communications expense increased 10%, primarily due to higher data and transaction processing costs related to the acquisition of Goldfish in February 2006. Marketing and business development expense increased 3% due to increased marketing costs associated with account 59 Table of Contents acquisitions, the launch of the Discover Business Card and higher advertising expenses due to the branding campaign launched at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Professional services expense increased 25% due to higher legal fees and investments in infrastructure and technology. Fiscal 2005s non interest expenses increased 9% from fiscal 2004, partially resulting from the acquisition of PULSE (see Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein). Compensation and benefits expense increased 15%, including Discovers share ($29 million) of the costs associated with senior management changes, as well as an increase in personnel costs, including salaries and benefits. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 7%. Marketing and business development expense increased 2% due to increased marketing and advertising costs. Professional services expense increased 12% due to higher consulting fees, partially related to the exploration of the potential spin off of Discover in fiscal 2005 and an increase in legal and account collection fees. Other expenses increased 16%, primarily reflecting an increase in certain operating expenses, including accruals for losses associated with cardmember fraud and higher legal accruals. Seasonal Factors. Discovers activities are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing. Historically, a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter, followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter. Merchant fees, therefore, historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting higher sales activity in the month of December. Additionally, higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter, reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume. Managed General Purpose Credit Card Loan Data. The Company analyzes its financial performance on both a managed loan basis and as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) (owned loan basis). Managed loan data assume that the Companys securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the Companys owned loans. The Company operates its Discover business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis. Accordingly, underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans. The Company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations. In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis, which provides a comparison with industry competitors.

Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 permits the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect of errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. Effective August 31, 2006, the Company elected early application of SAB 108. In accordance with SAB 108, the Company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 for the items described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior annual periods. Trust Preferred Securities. The Company adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 to reflect a change in its hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133). The change is being made following a clarification by the SEC of its interpretation of SFAS No. 133 related to the accounting for fair value hedges of fixed rate trust preferred securities. Since January 2005, the Company entered into various interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in its trust preferred securities. The terms of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding trust preferred securities mirrored one another, and the Company determined in the past that the changes in the fair value of the swaps and hedged instruments were the same. The Company applied the commonly used short cut method in accounting for these fair value hedges and, therefore, did not reflect any gains or losses during the relevant periods. Based upon the SECs clarification of SFAS No. 133, the Company determined that since it has the ability at its election to defer interest payments on its trust preferred securities, these swaps did not qualify for the short cut method. These swaps performed as expected as effective economic hedges of interest rate risk. The Company ended hedging of the interest rate risk on these trust preferred securities effective August 2006 and adjusted its financial results as if hedge accounting was never applied. Prospectively, the Company will manage the interest rate risk on these securities as part of its overall asset liability management. Compensation and Benefits. The Company also adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 and its financial results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 for two compensation and benefits accruals. Such accruals are related to (i) the overaccrual of certain payroll taxes in certain non U.S. locations, primarily in the U.K., which arose in fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2006 and (ii) an adjustment to the amortization expense associated with stock based compensation awards, which arose in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. Impact of Adjustments. The impact of each of the items noted above on fiscal 2006 opening Shareholders equity and Retained earnings and on Net income for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2006 is presented below (dollars in millions): TrustPreferred Securities Non U.S. PayrollTaxes Amortizationof Stock BasedCompensationAwards Total Cumulative effect on Shareholders equity as of December 1, 2005 $ (84 ) $ 38 $ 12 $ (34 ) Cumulative effect on Retained earnings as of December 1, 2005 $ (84 ) $ 38 $ (22 ) $ (68 ) Effect on: Net income for the three months ended February 28, 2006 $ (1 ) $ 14 $ $ 13 Net income for the three months ended May 31, 2006 $ (116 ) $ $ $ (116 ) Net income for the six months ended May 31, 2006 $ (117 ) $ 14 $ $ (103 ) 62 Table of Contents The aggregate impact of these adjustments is summarized below (dollars in millions, except per share data): As of and for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2006 Previously Reported Adjustment As Adjusted Other assets $ 15,988 $ 12 $ 16,000 Other liabilities $ 14,984 $ (98 ) $ 14,886 Long term borrowings $ 121,395 $ 131 $ 121,526 Shareholders equity $ 30,124 $ (21 ) $ 30,103 Principal transactions trading revenue $ 3,067 $ 13 $ 3,080 Compensation and benefits expense $ 4,183 $ (22 ) $ 4,161 Interest expense $ 9,481 $ 15 $ 9,496 Net income $ 1,561 $ 13 $ 1,574 Diluted EPS $ 1.47 $ 0.01 $ 1.48 Annualized return on common equity 21.1 % 0.2 % 21.3 % As of and for the Three Months Ended May 31, 2006 Previously Reported Adjustment As Adjusted Other assets $ 17,651 $ 12 $ 17,663 Other liabilities $ 18,159 $ (162 ) $ 17,997 Long term borrowings $ 127,985 $ 311 $ 128,296 Shareholders equity $ 32,255 $ (137 ) $ 32,118 Principal transactions trading revenue $ 3,735 $ (170 ) $ 3,565 Compensation and benefits expense $ 3,723 $ $ 3,723 Interest expense $ 9,988 $ 9 $ 9,997 Net income $ 1,957 $ (116 ) $ 1,841 Diluted EPS $ 1.86 $ (0.11 ) $ 1.75 Annualized return on common equity 25.1 % (1.4 )% 23.7 % For the Six Months Ended May 31, 2006 Previously Reported Adjustment As Adjusted Principal transactions trading revenue $ 6,802 $ (157 ) $ 6,645 Compensation and benefits expense $ 7,906 $ (22 ) $ 7,884 Interest expense $ 19,469 $ 24 $ 19,493 Net income $ 3,518 $ (103 ) $ 3,415 Diluted EPS $ 3.33 $ (0.10 ) $ 3.23 Annualized return on common equity 23.1 % (0.6 )% 22.5 % Stock Based Compensation. The Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), using the modified prospective approach as of December 1, 2004. SFAS No. 123R revised the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarified guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to service periods. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an $80 million gain ($49 million after tax) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 resulting from the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred. The cumulative effect gain increased both basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 by $0.05. For stock based awards issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Companys accounting policy for awards granted to retirement eligible employees was to recognize compensation cost over the service period specified in the award terms. The Company accelerates any unrecognized compensation cost for such awards if and when a retirement eligible employee leaves the Company. For stock based awards made to retirement eligible employees during fiscal 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for such awards on the date of grant. 63 Table of Contents For fiscal 2005 year end stock based compensation awards that were granted to retirement eligible employees in December 2005, the Company recognized the compensation cost for such awards at the date of grant instead of over the service period specified in the award terms. As a result, the Company recorded non cash incremental compensation expenses of approximately $270 million in fiscal 2006 for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees as part of the fiscal 2005 year end award process. These incremental expenses were included within Compensation and benefits expense and reduced income before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($190 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($50 million), Asset Management ($20 million) and Discover ($10 million) business segments. Additionally, based on interpretive guidance related to SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company changed its accounting policy for expensing the cost of anticipated fiscal 2006 year end equity awards that were granted to retirement eligible employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Effective December 1, 2005, the Company accrues the estimated cost of these awards over the course of the current fiscal year rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant (which occurred in December 2006). As a result, fiscal 2006 stock based compensation expense primarily included the following costs: amortization of fiscal 2003 year end awards; amortization of fiscal 2004 year end awards; amortization of fiscal 2005 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; the full cost of fiscal 2005 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2005); and the full cost of fiscal 2006 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2006). Fiscal 2007 stock based compensation expense will primarily include the following costs: amortization of fiscal 2004 year end awards; amortization of fiscal 2005 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; amortization of fiscal 2006 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; and the full cost of fiscal 2007 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (expected to be made in December 2007). Fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 year end awards are generally amortized over three and four years, while fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 year end awards are generally amortized over two and three years. Discontinued Operations. As described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 17, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved managements recommendation to sell the Companys non core aircraft leasing business. In connection with this action, the aircraft leasing business was classified as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144), and reported as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it would sell its aircraft leasing business to Terra Firma, a European private equity group, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities. The sale was completed on March 24, 2006. The results for discontinued operations in fiscal 2006 include a loss of $125 million ($75 million after tax) related to the impact of the finalization of the sales proceeds and balance sheet adjustments related to the closing. The results for fiscal 2005 reflected a charge of $509 million ($316 million after tax) to reflect the write down of the aircraft leasing business to its estimated fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144. 64 Table of Contents In fiscal 2004, the Company entered into agreements for the sale of certain aircraft. Accordingly, the Company designated such aircraft as held for sale and recorded a $42 million pre tax loss related to the write down of these aircraft to fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As of February 3, 2005, all of these aircraft were sold. In addition, during fiscal 2004, the Company recorded aircraft impairment charges in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The table below provides information regarding the pre tax loss on discontinued operations and the aircraft impairment charges that are included in these amounts (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Pre tax loss from discontinued operations $ 42 $ 486 $ 172 Aircraft impairment charges 109 Fiscal 2006 reflected a net loss of $25 million on discontinued operations, which included the results of operations of the aircraft leasing business through the date of sale. Fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reflected a net loss on discontinued operations of $302 million and $103 million, respectively. Discover Spin off. On December 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved the spin off of Discover in order to enhance shareholder value. The Discover Spin off will allow the Company to focus its efforts on more closely aligned firm wide strategic priorities within its Institutional Securities, Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management business segments. The Discover Spin off is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, and is expected to occur in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. At the time of the Discover Spin off, shareholders of the Company will receive shares in Discover on a tax free basis. Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions. Subsequent to Fiscal 2006.

The Company acquired the POSIT interest as part of its acquisition of Barra. 66 Table of Contents Coleman Litigation. On May 8, 2003, Coleman (Parent) Holdings Inc. (CPH) filed a complaint against the Company in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, Florida. The complaint relates to the 1998 merger between The Coleman Company, Inc. (Coleman) and Sunbeam, Inc. (Sunbeam). The complaint, as amended, alleges that CPH was induced to agree to the transaction with Sunbeam based on certain financial misrepresentations, and it asserts claims against the Company for aiding and abetting fraud, conspiracy and punitive damages. Shortly before trial, which commenced in April 2005, the trial court granted, in part, a motion for entry of a default judgment against the Company and ordered that portions of CPHs complaint, including those setting forth CPHs primary allegations against the Company, be read to the jury and deemed established for all purposes in the action. In May 2005, the jury returned a verdict in favor of CPH and awarded CPH $604 million in compensatory damages and $850 million in punitive damages. On June 23, 2005, the trial court issued a final judgment in favor of CPH in the amount of $1,578 million, which includes prejudgment interest and excludes certain payments received by CPH in settlement of related claims against others. On June 27, 2005, the Company filed a notice of appeal with the District Court of Appeal for the Fourth District of Florida (the Court of Appeal) and posted a supersedeas bond, which automatically stayed execution of the judgment pending appeal. Included in cash and securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements in the consolidated statement of financial condition is $1,840 million of money market deposits that have been pledged to obtain the supersedeas bond. The Company filed its initial brief in support of its appeal on December 7, 2005, and, on June 28, 2006, the Court of Appeal heard oral argument. The Companys appeal seeks to reverse the judgment of the trial court on several grounds and asks that the case be remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of the Company or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The Company believes, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is probable that the compensatory and punitive damages awards will be overturned on appeal and the case remanded for a new trial. Taking into account the advice of outside counsel, the Company is maintaining a reserve of $360 million for the Coleman litigation, which it believes to be a reasonable estimate, under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5), of the low end of the range of its probable exposure in the event the judgment is overturned and the case remanded for a new trial. If the compensatory and or punitive awards are ultimately upheld on appeal, in whole or in part, the Company may incur an additional expense equal to the difference between the amount affirmed on appeal (and post judgment interest thereon) and the amount of the reserve. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the amount of such additional expense, such additional expense could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company and or the Companys or Institutional Securities operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, and the upper end of the range could exceed $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Insurance Settlement. On September 11, 2001, the U.S. experienced terrorist attacks targeted against New York City and Washington, D.C. The attacks in New York resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center complex, where approximately 3,700 of the Companys employees were located, and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the U.S. Through the implementation of its business recovery plans, the Company relocated its displaced employees to other facilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company settled its claim with its insurance carriers related to the events of September 11, 2001. The Company recorded a pre tax gain of $251 million as the insurance recovery was in excess of previously recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks (primarily write offs of leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the World Trade Center complex, employee relocation and certain other employee related expenditures). The pre tax gain was recorded as a reduction to non interest expenses and is included within the Global Wealth Management Group ($198 million), Asset Management ($43 million) and Institutional Securities ($10 million) business segments. The insurance settlement was allocated to the respective segments in accordance with the relative damages sustained by each segment. 67 Table of Contents Lease Adjustment. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company did not record the effects of scheduled rent increases and rent free periods for certain real estate leases on a straight line basis. In addition, the Company had been accounting for certain tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvements instead of recording funds received as deferred rent and amortizing them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for these rent escalation clauses, rent free periods and tenant improvement allowances to properly reflect lease expense over the lease term on a straight line basis. The impact of this correction resulted in the Company recording $109 million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The impact of this change was included within non interest expenses and reduced income before taxes within the Institutional Securities ($71 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($29 million), Asset Management ($5 million) and Discover ($4 million) business segments. The impact of this correction was not material to the pre tax income of each of the segments or to the Company. Senior Management Compensation Charges. Compensation and benefits expense in fiscal 2005 included charges for certain members of senior management related to severance and new hires, which increased non interest expenses by approximately $311 million. These compensation charges were allocated to the Companys business segments as follows: Institutional Securities ($193 million), Global Wealth Management Group ($48 million), Asset Management ($41 million) and Discover ($29 million). Tax Matters. Income Tax Examinations. The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and states in which the Company has significant business operations, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction; for example, the current IRS examination covers 1999 2005. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations. The Company has established tax reserves that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts tax reserves only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. The Company believes that the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statement of income for a particular future period and on the Companys effective income tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs. Fiscal 2006 included an income tax benefit of $280 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, related to the resolution of the IRS examination of years 1994 1998. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act, adopted on October 22, 2004, provided for a special one time tax deduction, or dividend received deduction, of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a companys last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $309 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, resulting from the Companys repatriation of approximately $4.0 billion of qualifying foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The $309 million tax benefit resulted from the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities previously provided under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, net of additional taxes associated with these qualifying earnings. 68 Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Investees. The Company invests in unconsolidated investees that own synthetic fuel production plants. The Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting. The Companys share of the operating losses generated by these investments is recorded within Losses from unconsolidated investees, and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded within the Provision for income taxes. In fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the losses from unconsolidated investees were more than offset by the respective tax credits and tax benefits on the losses. The table below provides information regarding the losses from unconsolidated investees, tax credits and tax benefits on the losses: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Losses from unconsolidated investees $ 228 $ 311 $ 328 Tax credits 159 336 351 Tax benefits on losses 90 124 132 Under the current tax law, synthetic fuels tax credits are granted under Section 45K of the Internal Revenue Code. Synthetic fuels tax credits are available in full only when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the tax code, as adjusted for inflation (Base Price). The Base Price for each calendar year is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by April 1 of the following year. If the annual average price of a barrel of oil in 2006 or future years exceeds the applicable Base Price, the synthetic fuels tax credits generated by the Companys synthetic fuel facilities will be phased out, on a ratable basis, over the phase out range. Synthetic fuels tax credits realized in prior years are not affected by this limitation. Due to the high level of crude oil prices in fiscal 2006 and continued uncertainty regarding the value of tax credits associated with synthetic fuel investments, all of the Companys investees idled production at their synthetic fuel production facilities during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, all of the Companys investees began production at their synthetic fuel production facilities, largely due to a decline in the level of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter as compared with the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006. Additionally, based on fiscal year to date and futures prices at November 30, 2006, the Company estimates that there will be a partial phase out of tax credits earned in fiscal 2006. The impact of this anticipated partial phase out is included within Losses from unconsolidated investees and the Provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006. The Company has entered into derivative contracts designed to reduce its exposure to rising oil prices and the potential phase out of the synthetic fuels tax credits. Changes in fair value relative to these derivative contracts are included within Principal transactions trading revenues. Asset Management and Account Fees. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company was improperly recognizing certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid at the beginning of the relevant contract periods, which is when such fees were billed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of accounting for such fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period, generally quarterly or annually. As a result of the change, the Companys results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included an adjustment to reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees, account fees and related compensation expense paid to global representatives. The impact of this change reduced net revenues by $107 million, non interest expenses by $27 million and income before taxes by $80 million, at both the Company and the Global Wealth Management Group business segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Such adjustment reduced fiscal 2004 net income by approximately $50 million and basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05. 69 Table of Contents Pension Plans. Contributions. The Company made contributions of $114 million and $272 million to its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions to its funded plans by considering several factors, including the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. The Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations; for example, in the U.S., the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). At November 30, 2006, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the Companys U.S. pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Qualified Plan). Liabilities for benefits payable under its unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries. Pension Expense. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes the compensation cost of employees pension benefits (including prior service cost) over the employees approximate service period. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rate, which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, is used to measure the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and to calculate the service cost and interest cost. For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the assumed discount rate for all U.S. plans was selected by the Company, in consultation with its independent actuaries, using a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the Qualified Plan liabilities. The pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on the duration implicit in a representative broad based Aa corporate bond universe of high quality fixed income investments. It includes only bonds of reasonable issue size and excludes certain types of bonds, such as callable bonds. As of November 30, 2006, the Qualified Plan liabilities represented 79% of the total liabilities of the Companys U.S. and non U.S. pension plans combined. The Company, in consultation with its independent actuaries, set the assumed discount rates used for non U.S. pension plans based on the nature of liabilities, local economic environments and available bond indices. The expected long term rate of return on assets represents the Companys best estimate of the long term return on plan assets and generally was estimated by computing a weighted average return of the underlying long term expected returns on the different asset classes based on the target asset allocations and taking into consideration estimated expenses and the benefits of diversification and the rebalancing of the portfolio. This rate is expected to remain the same from one year to the next, but is adjusted when there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions. As of November 30, 2006, the Qualified Plan assets represented 89% of the total assets of the Companys U.S. and non U.S. pension plans combined. To better align the duration of plan assets with the duration of plan liabilities, the Qualified Plans target asset allocation policy was changed in September 2005 from 50%/50% equity/fixed income to 45%/55% equity/fixed income, and the duration of the fixed income portfolio was extended from 13 to 18 years. As a result, the Company, in consultation with its independent investment consultants and actuaries, lowered its expected long term rate of return on its Qualified Plan assets from 7.00% to 6.75% for fiscal 2006 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The impact of this change was not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2006. The preliminary expected long term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets remains unchanged at 6.75% for fiscal 2007. 70 Table of Contents The Companys fiscal 2006 expected long term rate of return on assets for its Qualified Plan was based on the following target asset allocation: Target InvestmentMix Expected AnnualReturn(1) Domestic equity: Large capitalization 30 % 8.0 % Small capitalization 3 % 8.4 % International equity 12 % 8.4 % Fixed income: Long term government/corporate 55 % 5.0 % (1) These returns do not include the impact of diversification on the overall expected portfolio return. Each year the Company compares its initial estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets for the Qualified Plan (and adjusts, if necessary) with a portfolio return calculator model (the Portfolio Model) that produces a range of expected returns for the portfolio. Return assumptions used are forward looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns. The Portfolio Model begins with the current U.S. Treasury yield curve, recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields. Corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums, based on current market conditions, are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class. The resulting expected portfolio investment is then adjusted downward to reflect assumed expenses, which include investment and transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets, added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds, as well as administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The Company uses the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets component of pension expense. For the Qualified Plan, expected returns are computed based on a market related value of assets. The market related value of assets is a smoothed actuarial value of assets equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period. The market related value of assets must be no greater than 120% and no less than 80% of the market value of assets. Investment income equal to the expected return on the plans assets as calculated for the prior years expense is recognized immediately. Any difference between the actual investment income (on a market value basis) and the expected return is recognized over a five year period in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. Other assumptions, including mortality rates, long term salary growth and employee turnover rates, are set by the Company in consultation with its independent actuaries. These assumptions are tested every year by monitoring gains and losses, performing assumption studies as needed, and monitoring Company objectives and actuarial trends. These assumptions are adjusted whenever necessary. The Company amortizes (as a component of pension expense) unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service of active participants (5 to 20 years depending upon the plan) to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. The loss amortization component for the U.S. and the non U.S. pension plans was $60 million for fiscal 2006 (33% of pension expense) and $49 million for fiscal 2005 (31% of pension expense). Accounting Developments. Determining the Variability in Variable Interest Entities. In April 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 46(R) 6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FSP FIN 46(R) 6). FSP FIN 46(R) 6 requires that the determination of the variability to be considered in applying FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), be based on an analysis of the design of the 71 Table of Contents entity. In evaluating whether an interest with a variable interest entity creates or absorbs variability, FSP FIN 46(R) 6 focuses on the role of a contract or arrangement in the design of an entity, regardless of its legal form or accounting classification. The Company adopted the guidance in FSP FIN 46(R) 6 prospectively on September 1, 2006 to all entities that the Company first becomes involved with and to all entities previously required to be analyzed under FIN 46R when a reconsideration event has occurred under paragraph 7 of FIN 46R. The adoption of FSP FIN 46(R) 6 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Limited Partnerships. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF Issue No. 04 5). Under the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 5, a general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership and, therefore, should include the limited partnership in its consolidated financial statements, regardless of the amount or extent of the general partners interest unless a majority of the limited partners can vote to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without having to show cause or the limited partners have substantive participating rights that can overcome the presumption of control by the general partner. EITF Issue No. 04 5 was effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified. For all other existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have not been modified, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 04 5 on December 1, 2006. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04 5 on December 1, 2006 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS No. 155), which amends SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140). SFAS No. 155 permits hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation to irrevocably be accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of income. The fair value election may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS No. 155 also eliminates a restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold. The Company adopted SFAS No. 155 on December 1, 2006 and has elected to fair value only certain hybrid financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event after December 1, 2006. Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). SFAS No. 156 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. The standard permits an entity to subsequently measure each class of servicing assets or servicing liabilities at fair value and report changes in fair value in the statement of income in the period in which the changes occur. The Company adopted SFAS No. 156 on December 1, 2006 and has elected to fair value certain servicing rights held as of the date of adoption. This election did not have a material impact on the Companys opening balance of Retained earnings as of December 1, 2006. The Company will also elect to fair value certain servicing rights acquired after December 1, 2006. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for the Company as of December 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting FIN 48. 72 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In addition, SFAS No. 157 disallows the use of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market, and nullifies select guidance provided by EITF Issue No. 02 3, which prohibited the recognition of trading gains or losses at the inception of a derivative contract, unless the fair value of such derivative is obtained from a quoted market price, or other valuation technique that incorporates observable market data. SFAS No. 157 also requires the Company to consider its own credit spreads when measuring the fair value of liabilities, including derivatives. Effective December 1, 2006, the Company elected early adoption of SFAS No. 157. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to block discounts and EITF Issue No. 02 3, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $80 million after tax as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings as of December 1, 2006, which was primarily associated with EITF Issue No. 02 3. The impact of considering the Companys own credit spreads when measuring the fair value of liabilities, including derivatives, did not have a material impact on fair value measurements at the date of adoption. With the adoption of SFAS No. 157, the Company will no longer apply the revenue recognition criteria of EITF Issue No. 02 3. The Company is currently unable to quantify the impact, if any, that this change in accounting methodology will have on its results of operations in fiscal 2007, since such impact will be dependent upon, among other things, the nature, volume and size of structured derivative transactions that the Company may enter into during fiscal 2007. Employee Benefit Plans. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). Among other items, SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entitys defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires the measurement of defined benefit and postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year. SFAS No. 158s requirement to recognize the funded status in the financial statements is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, and its requirement to use the fiscal year end date as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 158 will have on its consolidated results of operations and cash flows. However, if SFAS No. 158 were to be applied by the Company as of November 30, 2006, based on a September 30, 2006 measurement date, the effect on its consolidated statement of financial position would be an after tax charge to Shareholders equity of approximately $355 million. 73 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Financial Instruments Used For Trading and Investment. Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, which include cash and derivative products, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition, and gains and losses are reflected in Principal transactions trading and investment revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The fair value of the Companys Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are generally based on observable market prices, observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for Financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded. Bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time. Ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time. A substantial percentage of the fair value of the Companys Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased is based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product (or a related product) may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment. The price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. Price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace, and the characteristics particular to the transaction. Products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency. By contrast, products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency. Even in normally active markets, the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation. Alternatively, in thinly quoted markets, the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation. The Companys cash products include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, other sovereign debt obligations, corporate and other debt securities, corporate equity securities, exchange traded funds and physical commodities. The fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters. These products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value. Examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, exchange traded corporate equity securities, most municipal debt securities, most corporate debt securities, most high yield debt securities, physical commodities, certain tradable loan products and most mortgage backed securities. 74 Table of Contents In certain circumstances, principally involving loan products and other financial instruments held for securitization transactions, the Company determines fair value from within the range of bid and ask prices such that fair value indicates the value likely to be realized in a current market transaction. Bid prices reflect the price that the Company and others pay, or stand ready to pay, to originators of such assets. Ask prices represent the prices that the Company and others require to sell such assets to the entities that acquire the financial instruments for purposes of completing the securitization transactions. Generally, the fair value of such acquired assets is based upon the bid price in the market for the instrument or similar instruments. In general, the loans and similar assets are valued at bid pricing levels until structuring of the related securitization is substantially complete and such that the value likely to be realized in a current transaction is consistent with the price that a securitization entity will pay to acquire the financial instruments. Factors affecting securitized value and investor demand relating specifically to loan products include, but are not limited to, loan type, underlying property type and geographic location, loan interest rate, loan to value ratios, debt service coverage ratio, investor demand and credit enhancement levels. In addition, some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency, and the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, certain tradable loan products, distressed debt securities (i.e., securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties, including bankruptcy or insolvency) and equity securities that are not publicly traded. Generally, the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product, which can include cash flow analysis, revenue or net income analysis, default recovery analysis (i.e., analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery) and other analyses applied consistently. The following table presents the valuation of the Companys cash products included within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased by level of price transparency (dollars in millions): At November 30, 2006 At November 30, 2005 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Observable market prices, parameters or derived from observable prices or parameters $ 295,547 $ 124,708 $ 203,590 $ 101,972 Reduced or no price transparency 29,863 920 11,131 76 Total $ 325,410 $ 125,628 $ 214,721 $ 102,048 The Companys derivative products include exchange traded and OTC derivatives. Exchange traded derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above. OTC derivatives, whose fair value is derived using pricing models, include a wide variety of instruments, such as interest rate swap and option contracts, foreign currency option contracts, credit and equity swap and option contracts, and commodity swap and option contracts. The following table presents the fair value of the Companys exchange traded and OTC derivatives included within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased (dollars in millions): At November 30, 2006 At November 30, 2005 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Exchange traded $ 12,554 $ 17,094 $ 4,491 $ 8,151 OTC 42,889 40,397 41,403 36,801 Total $ 55,443 $ 57,491 $ 45,894 $ 44,952 The fair value of OTC derivative contracts is derived primarily using pricing models, which may require multiple market input parameters. Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity. These adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based upon observable market data 75 Table of Contents where available. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on December 1, 2006, the Company followed the provisions of EITF Issue No. 02 3 (see Other Items Accounting Developments herein). Under EITF Issue No. 02 3, in the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices or parameters of other comparable current market transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, revenue recognition at the inception of an OTC derivative financial instrument is not permitted. Such revenue is recognized in income at the earlier of when there is market value observability or at the end of the contract period. In the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market, observable prices or parameters of other comparable current market transactions, or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract, fair value is based on the transaction price. The Company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by OTC derivatives. Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed form analytic formulae, such as the Black Scholes option pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof, applied consistently. In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Company are widely accepted by the financial services industry. Pricing models take into account the contract terms, including the maturity, as well as market parameters such as interest rates, volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts. A substantial majority of OTC derivative products valued by the Company using pricing models fall into this category. Other derivative products, typically the newest and most complex products, will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the models market parameters. The Company manages its market exposure for OTC derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or other related financial instruments. The Companys trading divisions, the Financial Control Department and the Market Risk Department continuously monitor the price changes of the OTC derivatives in relation to the offsetting positions. For a further discussion of the price transparency of the Companys OTC derivative products, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A. Equity and debt investments purchased in connection with private equity and other principal investment activities initially are valued at cost to approximate fair value. The carrying value of such investments is adjusted when changes in the underlying fair values are readily ascertainable, generally as evidenced by observable market prices or transactions that directly affect the value of such investments. Downward adjustments relating to such investments are made in the event that the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value. The Companys partnership interests, including general partnership and limited partnership interests in real estate funds, are included within Other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and are recorded at fair value based upon changes in the fair value of the underlying partnerships net assets. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible. In the event that market prices or parameters are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial Control and Market Risk Departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or 76 Table of Contents both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more information regarding the Companys risk management practices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A. Allowance for Consumer Loan Losses. The allowance for consumer loan losses in the Companys Discover business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses. Provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances. The allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio. The allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio and is evaluated quarterly for adequacy. In estimating the allowance for consumer loan losses, the Company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach. This process starts with a migration analysis (a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off) of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in consumer loans. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact credit losses, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. A provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses (see Discover Provision for Consumer Loan Losses herein). Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress. The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The number of these reviews, investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including the Company. Reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case by case basis and represent an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the 77 Table of Contents Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of litigation, regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded reserves, if any. See Notes 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings and tax examinations. Special Purpose Entities. The Company enters into a variety of transactions with special purpose entities (SPE), primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds, credit card loans and other types of financial instruments. In most cases, these SPEs are deemed to be variable interest entities (VIE). Unless a VIE is determined to be a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), the Company is required under accounting guidance to perform an analysis of each VIE at the date upon which the Company becomes involved with it to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case the Company must consolidate the VIE. QSPEs are not consolidated. The determination of whether an SPE meets the accounting requirements of a QSPE requires significant judgment, particularly in evaluating whether the permitted activities of the SPE are significantly limited and in determining whether derivatives held by the SPE are passive and nonexcessive. In addition, the analysis involved in determining whether an entity is a VIE, and in determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, also requires significant judgment. Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations. The Companys results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors. In addition, results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including political, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of capital; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates; currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; the availability and cost of credit; inflation; and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets. In addition, there continues to be a heightened level of legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could increase costs, thereby affecting future results of operations. Such factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect the Companys business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. 78 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Companys senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. These committees, along with the Companys Treasury Department and other control groups, also assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure, thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the Companys liquidity and capital policies. For a description of the Companys other principal risks and how they are monitored and managed, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A. The Companys liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the Company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations when they come due without material, adverse franchise or business impact. The key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the Companys business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. The principal elements of the Companys liquidity framework are the cash capital policy, the liquidity reserve and stress testing through the contingency funding plan. Comprehensive financing guidelines (collateralized funding, long term funding strategy, surplus capacity, diversification, staggered maturities and committed credit facilities) support the Companys target liquidity profile. The Balance Sheet. The Company monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. Given the nature of the Companys market making and customer financing activities, the size of the balance sheet fluctuates from time to time. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing and managing its business. The Companys total assets increased to $1,120,645 million at November 30, 2006 from $898,523 million at November 30, 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in financial instruments owned (largely driven by increases in corporate and other debt and corporate equities), securities borrowed, receivables from customers, and securities received as collateral. The increases were largely the result of an increase in client business opportunities. Balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a companys overall liquidity and capital policies. The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends. The Company has adopted a definition of adjusted assets that excludes certain self funded assets considered to have minimal market, credit and or liquidity risk. These low risk assets generally are attributable to the Companys matched book and securities lending businesses. Adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FIN 46R. The adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets (as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs). In addition, the Company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities. These characteristics include the long dated nature (e.g., some have final maturity at issuance of 30 years extendible at the Companys option by a further 19 years, others have a 60 year final maturity at issuance), the Companys ability to defer coupon interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters and the subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure. The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these securities. 79 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the Companys total assets, adjusted assets and leverage ratios as of November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 and for the average month end balances during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005: Balance at Average Month End Balance November 30,2006 November 30,2005 Fiscal 2006(1) Fiscal 2005 (dollars in millions, except ratio data) Total assets $ 1,120,645 $ 898,523 $ 1,022,113 $ 828,009 Less: Securities purchased under agreements to resell (174,866 ) (174,330 ) (183,266 ) (147,057 ) Securities borrowed (299,631 ) (244,241 ) (274,807 ) (225,984 ) Add: Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased 183,119 147,000 157,678 130,936 Less: Derivative contracts sold, not yet purchased (57,491 ) (44,952 ) (47,176 ) (42,192 ) Subtotal 771,776 582,000 674,542 543,712 Less: Segregated customer cash and securities balances (16,782 ) (30,540 ) (29,286 ) (30,483 ) Assets recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 and FIN 46R (100,236 ) (67,091 ) (82,992 ) (56,865 ) Goodwill and net intangible assets (3,350 ) (2,500 ) (2,886 ) (2,471 ) Adjusted assets $ 651,408 $ 481,869 $ 559,378 $ 453,893 Common equity $ 34,264 $ 29,182 $ 31,740 $ 28,501 Preferred equity 1,100 423 Shareholders equity 35,364 29,182 32,163 28,501 Junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts 4,884 2,764 3,875 2,859 Subtotal 40,248 31,946 36,038 31,360 Less: Goodwill and net intangible assets (3,350 ) (2,500 ) (2,886 ) (2,471 ) Tangible shareholders equity $ 36,898 $ 29,446 $ 33,152 $ 28,889 Leverage ratio(2) 30.4 x 30.5 x 30.8 x 28.7 x Adjusted leverage ratio(3) 17.7 x 16.4 x 16.9 x 15.7 x (1) The results for the Company and for the Institutional Securities segment for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 were adjusted (see Other Items Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 herein). (2) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders equity. (3) Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity. Activity in Fiscal 2006. The Companys total capital consists of shareholders equity, long term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months), junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts, and Capital Units. At November 30, 2006, total capital was $162,134 million, an increase of $36,243 million from November 30, 2005. During the 12 months ended November 30, 2006, the Company issued senior notes aggregating $49.5 billion, including non U.S. dollar currency notes aggregating $21.3 billion and $1,989 million of junior subordinated debentures. In connection with the note issuances, the Company has entered into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short term London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) trading levels. At November 30, 2006, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Companys senior debt indentures) was approximately $158 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries). The weighted average maturity of the Companys long term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5.5 years at November 30, 2006. Subsequent to fiscal year end and through January 31, 2007, the Companys long term borrowings (net of repayments) increased by approximately $11 billion. 80 Table of Contents Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Company and Morgan Stanley Finance plc, a U.K. subsidiary, announced the Companys intention to redeem all of the outstanding Capital Units on February 28, 2007. In July 2006, the Company issued 44,000,000 Depositary Shares, in an aggregate of $1,100 million, representing 1/1,000th of a Share of Floating Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, $0.01 par value (Series A Preferred Stock). The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Companys option, in whole or in part, on or after July 15, 2011 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per Depositary Share). The Series A Preferred Stock also has a preference over the Companys common stock upon liquidation. Economic Capital. The Company uses an economic capital model to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support the risk of its business activities and to ensure that the Company remains adequately capitalized. The Company calculates economic capital on a going concern basis, which is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators, rating agencies and the market. Business unit economic capital allocations are evaluated by benchmarking to similarly rated peer firms by business segment. The Company believes this methodology provides an indication of the appropriate level of capital for each business segment as if each were an independent operating entity. Economic capital requirements are allocated to each business segment and are sub allocated to product lines as appropriate. This process is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business, provide business managers with tools for measuring and managing risk, and allow senior management to evaluate risk adjusted returns (such as return on economic capital and shareholder value added) to facilitate resource allocation decisions. The Companys methodology is based on a going concern approach that assigns common equity to each business unit based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses, including principal investment risk. Regulatory capital, including additional capital assigned for goodwill and intangible assets, is a minimum requirement to ensure the Companys access to funding and credibility in the market. The Company believes it must be able to sustain stress losses and maintain capital substantially above regulatory minimums while supporting ongoing business activities. The difference between the Companys consolidated book equity and aggregate common equity requirements denotes the Companys unallocated capital position, which is not currently reflected in business segment performance metrics. The Company assesses stress loss capital across various dimensions of market, credit, business and operational risks. Stress losses are defined at the 90% to 95% confidence interval in order to capture worst potential losses in 10 to 20 years. Stress loss calculations are tangible and transparent and avoid reliance on extreme loss statistical models. Market risk scenarios capture systematic, idiosyncratic and random market risk through the use of internal market stress data. Credit risk is included in the form of idiosyncratic counterparty default events. Business risk incorporates earnings volatility due to variability in revenue flows, with estimates on the mix of fixed versus variable expenses at various points in the business cycle. Operational stress losses primarily reflect legal risk across the Company. The Company may enhance the economic capital model and allocation methodology over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment to ensure that the model continues to reflect the risks inherent in the Companys business activities and to reflect changes in the drivers of the level and cost of required capital. 81 Table of Contents The following table presents the Companys allocated average common equity (economic capital) during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 Average common equity (dollars in billions): Institutional Securities $ 18.2 $ 14.6 Global Wealth Management Group 3.2 3.7 Asset Management 2.2 1.7 Discover 4.9 4.4 Total from operating segments 28.5 24.4 Discontinued operations 1.2 Unallocated capital 3.2 2.9 Consolidated $ 31.7 $ 28.5 The increase in economic capital allocated to Institutional Securities reflects the increased risk profile that has resulted from the Companys decisions to invest in key businesses. The Company expects this growth to continue, provided market opportunities continue to warrant such investments. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, economic capital will be met by regulatory Tier 1 equity (including common shareholders equity, certain preferred stock, eligible hybrid capital instruments and deductions of goodwill and certain intangible assets and deferred tax assets), subject to regulatory limits. The Tier 1 equity components will also be reflected in the average common equity allocated to the business segments. This enhancement to the Companys equity capital model and related disclosures will be made on a prospective basis. The following table presents the Companys fiscal 2006 fourth quarter average common equity as calculated under the current methodology and under the new methodology commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2007: CurrentMethodology Pro Forma underNew Methodology CommonEquity Tier 1Equity CommonEquity Fiscal 2006 Fourth Quarter Average Common Equity (dollars in billions): Total from operating segments $ 30.2 $ 27.2 $ 27.7 Unallocated capital 3.5 6.0 6.0 Consolidated $ 33.7 $ 33.2 $ 33.7 The $2.5 billion of incremental unallocated capital under the pro forma new methodology is due to the inclusion of eligible hybrid capital instruments, which is partially offset by the inclusion of certain deferred tax assets. A portion of the unallocated capital existing as of November 30, 2006 has been used for the acquisitions and investments that closed subsequent to fiscal year end (see also Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein). The Company currently anticipates that unallocated capital will be used for organic growth, additional acquisitions and other capital needs, including repurchases of common stock. During fiscal 2007, the Companys shareholders equity will be affected by the adoption of SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 158 (see Other Items Accounting Developments herein). Equity Capital Management Policies. The Companys senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and, therefore, pursues a strategy of ensuring that the Companys equity capital base adequately reflects and provides protection from the economic risks inherent in its businesses. Capital is required for, among other things, the Companys inventories, underwritings, principal investments, consumer loans, bridge loans and other financings, investments in fixed assets and for future uses. Capital for future uses will be included within unallocated capital until required by the business segments. The Company also considers return 82 Table of Contents on common equity to be an important measure of its performance, in the context of both the particular business environment in which the Company is operating and its peer groups results. In this regard, the Company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total equity, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity. At November 30, 2006, the Companys equity capital (which includes shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts) was $40,248 million, an increase of $8,302 million from November 30, 2005. The Company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased approximately $3.4 billion of its common stock (approximately 52 million shares) through open market purchases at an average cost of $65.43 (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5). In December 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock. This share repurchase authorization replaces the Companys previous repurchase authorizations with one repurchase program for capital management purposes that will consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as equity based compensation and benefit plan requirements. The Company expects to exercise the authorization over the next 12 18 months at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to its surplus capital position, market conditions and regulatory considerations. The Board of Directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In December 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.27. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $388.045 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.388045). Liquidity Management Policies. The primary goal of the Companys liquidity and funding activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments. Given the highly liquid nature of the Companys balance sheet, day to day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of stable collateralized financing. The Company has centralized management of credit sensitive unsecured funding sources in the Treasury Department. In order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability, the Company has designed a liquidity management framework. Liquidity ManagementFramework: Designed to: Contingency Funding Plan Ascertain the Companys ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the businesses. The contingency funding plan sets forth the process and the internal and external communication flows necessary to ensure effective management of the contingency event. Analytical processes exist to periodically evaluate and report the liquidity risk exposures of the organization under management defined scenarios. Cash Capital Ensure that the Company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its financial obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt. The Company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash capital (long term debt and equity capital) to finance illiquid assets and the portion of its securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment. 83 Table of Contents Liquidity ManagementFramework: Designed to: Liquidity Reserve Maintain, at all times, a liquidity reserve composed of immediately available cash and cash equivalents and a pool of unencumbered securities that can be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity to the Company. The reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on day to day funding requirements and strategic liquidity targets. The liquidity reserve averaged approximately $44 billion during fiscal 2006, of which approximately $36 billion on average was held at the parent company. Contingency Funding Plan. The Companys Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year; (ii) maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral; (iii) return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities; (iv) additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a ratings downgrade; (v) higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding; (vi) client cash withdrawals; (vii) drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; and (viii) discretionary unsecured debt buybacks. The Companys CFP is developed at the legal entity level in order to capture specific cash requirements and availability for the parent company and each of its major operating subsidiaries. The CFP assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be trapped at subsidiaries due to regulatory, legal or tax constraints. In addition, the CFP assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities. Cash Capital. The Company maintains a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include the parent companys equity and the non current portion of certain long term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following: (i) illiquid assets such as buildings, equipment, goodwill, net intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and principal investments; (ii) a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment (i.e., stressed haircuts); and (iii) expected drawdowns on unfunded commitments. The Company seeks to maintain a surplus cash capital position. The Companys equity capital of $40,248 million (including junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts), long term borrowings (debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than 12 months) of $121,820 million and Capital Units of $66 million comprised the Companys total capital of $162,134 million as of November 30, 2006, which substantially exceeded cash capital requirements. Liquidity Reserve. The Company seeks to maintain a target liquidity reserve that is sized to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets, including coverage of a significant portion of expected cash outflows over a short term horizon in a potential liquidity crisis. This liquidity reserve is held in the form of cash deposits with banks and a pool of unencumbered securities. The Company manages the pool of unencumbered securities, against which funding can be raised, on a global basis, and securities for the pool are chosen accordingly. The U.S. and non U.S. components, held in the form of a reverse repurchase agreement at the parent company, consists of U.S. and European government bonds and other high quality collateral and at November 30, 2006 were approximately $41 billion and averaged approximately $26 billion for the year ended November 30, 2006. The parent company cash component of the liquidity reserve at November 30, 2006 was approximately $7 billion and averaged approximately $10 billion for the year ended November 30, 2006. The Company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserve (cash and securities) is maintained enhances its ability to quickly and 84 Table of Contents efficiently source funding in a stressed environment. The Companys funding requirements and target liquidity reserve may vary based on changes in the level and composition of its balance sheet, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors. Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of committed credit facilities serves to further diversify the Companys funding sources. The Company values committed credit as a secondary component of its liquidity management framework. The committed credit facilities include a diversification of lenders to the Company covering geographic regions, including North America, Europe and Asia. The Company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs, including the issuance of commercial paper, which consists of three separate tranches: a U.S. dollar tranche with the Company as borrower; a Japanese yen tranche with Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd. (MSJS) as borrower and the Company as borrower and guarantor for MSJS borrowings; and a multicurrency tranche available in both euro and sterling with the Company as borrower. Under this combined facility (the Credit Facility), the banks are committed to provide up to $7.5 billion under the U.S. dollar tranche, 80 billion Japanese yen under the Japanese yen tranche and $3.25 billion under the multicurrency tranche. At November 30, 2006, the Company had a $16.4 billion consolidated stockholders equity surplus as compared with the Credit Facilitys covenant requirement. The Company anticipates that it may utilize the Credit Facility for short term funding from time to time (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in its Credit Facility will impair its ability to obtain funding under the Credit Facility, pay its current level of dividends or obtain loan arrangements, letters of credit and other financial guarantees or other financial accommodations. At November 30, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain certain committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs. These facilities are expected to be drawn from time to time to cover short term funding needs. On a yearly basis, the Companys committed credit strategy is reviewed and approved by its senior management. This strategy takes the Companys total liquidity sources into consideration when determining the appropriate size and mix of committed credit. The Company, through several of its subsidiaries, maintains several funded committed credit facilities to support various businesses, including (without limitation), the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan, derivative contracts, warehouse lending, emerging market loan, structured product, corporate loan, investment banking and prime brokerage businesses. Capital Covenant. In October 2006, the Company executed a replacement capital covenant in connection with the offering by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII (the Trust) of $1,100,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of its 6.60% Trust Preferred Securities (the Capital Securities). Under the terms of the replacement capital covenant, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of the holders of covered debt, as described below, that it will not, and will cause the Trust and its subsidiaries not to, redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities (or the debentures that the Company issued to the Trust that underlie the Capital Securities) on or after January 15, 2046 and prior to October 15, 2066, unless (i) the Company has obtained any then required regulatory approval and (ii) during a specified 180 day period the Company has received net proceeds from the sale of specified replacement capital securities. The initial class of covered debtholders are the holders of the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities of Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VI and the holders of such capital securities. For a complete description of the replacement capital securities and the other terms of the replacement capital covenant, see the Companys Current Report on Form 8 K dated October 12, 2006. 85 Table of Contents Funding Management Policies. The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include the Companys equity capital; long term debt; repurchase agreements; U.S., Canadian, Euro, Japanese and Australian commercial paper; asset backed securitizations; letters of credit; unsecured bond borrowings; securities lending; buy/sell agreements; municipal reinvestments; promissory notes; master notes; and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. Repurchase agreement transactions, securities lending and a portion of the Companys bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and, therefore, provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the U.S., European and Asian markets, targeting global investors and currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The Companys bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers, purchase Federal Funds, issue short term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes. Interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings, brokered and other time deposits. Savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits obtained from individual securities clients. Brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit issued by the Companys bank subsidiaries. Other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposit. The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations that would result from an interruption in the availability of the Companys funding sources. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period. The Company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity. In addition, the Company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least 110% of its outstanding short term unsecured borrowings. The Company also maintains committed credit facilities (described above) to support its ongoing borrowing programs. Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with stable collateralized borrowings, while the securitization market allows for the securitization of the credit card receivables arising from the Companys Discover business. The Companys goal is to maximize funding through less credit sensitive collateralized borrowings and asset securitizations in order to reduce reliance on unsecured financing. The Institutional Securities business emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding, which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. As part of this effort, the Institutional Securities business continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity. Similarly, Discover, through its use of the securitization market, reduces the need for other unsecured parent company financing. Unsecured Financing. The Company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories, consumer loans and illiquid assets. In general, securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding, floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate. Fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt. Both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt (in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the Companys Discover business) are used to finance the Companys consumer loan portfolio. Consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed. The Company uses 86 Table of Contents derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management, reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company issues long term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its Cash Capital Policy. In addition to these needs, long term debt funding is employed to enhance the Companys liquidity position by reducing reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings). Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. The Company has a portfolio approach for managing the unsecured debt issued by the parent company. This approach gives the Company flexibility to manage the unsecured debt portfolio across maturities, currencies, investors and regions, taking into account market capacity and pricing. Down lending to subsidiaries is managed to ensure that intercompany borrowings mature before those of the parent company. Liquidity and funding policies recognize potential constraints on the Companys ability to transfer funds between regulated entities and the parent company. During fiscal 2006, the Companys long term financing strategy was driven, in part, by its continued focus on improving its balance sheet strength (evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions), a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings. As a result, for fiscal 2006, $39 billion of unsecured debt was issued (excluding certain equity linked and credit linked products not considered to be a component of the Companys cash capital). Financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as well as international institutional and retail clients. Unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately $24 billion. During fiscal 2006, the Company also issued an aggregate of $3.1 billion of hybrid and equity capital securities in furtherance of its capital management objectives. This included $1.1 billion of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and $1.1 billion of enhanced trust preferred securities. Credit Ratings. The Companys reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important. The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the Companys short term and long term credit ratings. Factors that are significant to the determination of the Companys credit ratings or that otherwise affect its ability to raise short term and long term financing include the Companys level and volatility of earnings, relative positions in the markets in which it operates, geographic and product diversification, retention of key personnel, risk profile, risk management policies, cash liquidity, capital structure, corporate lending credit risk, and legal and regulatory developments. In addition, continuing consolidation in the credit card industry presents Discover with stronger competitors that may challenge future growth. A deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the Company, thereby increasing the cost to the Company in obtaining unsecured funding. In addition, the Companys debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business, the Company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors. At November 30, 2006, the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the Companys senior debt credit rating was approximately $1,184 million. Of this amount, $561 million relates to bilateral 87 Table of Contents arrangements between the Company and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the other. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the Company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded. As of January 31, 2007, the Companys credit ratings were as follows: Commercial Paper Senior Debt Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited R 1 (middle) AA (low) Fitch Ratings(1) F1+ AA Moodys Investors Service P 1 Aa3 Rating and Investment Information, Inc. a 1+ AA Standard & Poors(2) A 1 A+ (1) On December 19, 2006, Fitch Ratings changed the outlook on the Companys senior debt ratings from Stable to Negative. (2) On October 27, 2006, Standard & Poors changed the outlook on the Companys senior debt ratings from Stable to Positive. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities and Discover businesses. Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the Companys Institutional Securities business were approximately $4.8 billion at November 30, 2006, the majority of which were related to residential mortgage loan, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys Institutional Securities securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities and the Companys arrangements with these entities. The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Discover Activities. The asset securitization market is an important source of funding for the Companys Discover business. By utilizing this market, the Company further diversifies its funding sources, realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the Companys other funding sources, including unsecured debt. The securitization transaction structures utilized for the Discover business are accounted for as sales; i.e., off balance sheet transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In connection with its credit card securitization program, the Company transfers credit card receivables, on a revolving basis, to a trust, which issues asset backed securities that are registered with the SEC, are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed. This structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions, 88 Table of Contents potentially resulting in the need for the Company to obtain alternative funding arrangements. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (economic early amortization). Economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows (which would occur if the coupon, contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables) and is driven primarily by the trusts credit card receivables performance (in particular, receivables yield, cardmember fees and credit losses incurred) as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities. In the event of an economic early amortization, receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from the Company would instead continue to be recognized on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities. Recognizing these receivables would require the Company to obtain alternative funding. Guarantees. FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45) requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. FIN 45 defines guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. FIN 45 also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The table below summarizes certain information regarding derivative contracts, financial guarantees to third parties, market value guarantees and liquidity facilities at November 30, 2006: Maximum Potential Payout/Notional CarryingAmount Collateral/Recourse Years to Maturity Type of Guarantee Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 Total (dollars in millions) Notional amount of derivative contracts $ 688,352 $ 688,882 $ 1,267,757 $ 1,240,811 $ 3,885,802 $ 37,547 $ 119 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees 2,017 772 552 3,231 6,572 152 1,621 Market value guarantees 172 30 628 830 48 133 Liquidity facilities 1,692 110 1,802 See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information on indemnities, exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees, general partner guarantees, securitized asset guarantees, merchant chargeback guarantees and other guarantees. 89 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments. In connection with its operating activities, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations, as well as commitments to fund certain fixed assets and other less liquid investments. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2006 include long term borrowings, operating leases and purchase obligations. The Companys future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations as of November 30, 2006 are summarized below: Payments Due in: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 2009 Fiscal 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (dollars in millions) Long term borrowings(1) $ 18,274 $ 45,665 $ 22,719 $ 58,320 $ 144,978 Operating leases office facilities(2) 506 913 590 1,852 3,861 Operating leases equipment(2) 374 428 145 44 991 Purchase obligations(3) 1,736 601 157 24 2,518 Total $ 20,890 $ 47,607 $ 23,611 $ 60,240 $ 152,348 (1) See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, advertising, sponsorship, and computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2006 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Purchase obligations also include amounts related to the acquisitions of Saxon, FrontPoint and CityMortgage (see Other Items Business and Other Acquisitions and Dispositions herein). The Companys commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, other financial guarantees, investment activities, and corporate lending and financing commitments as of November 30, 2006 are summarized below by period of expiration. Since commitments associated with letters of credit, other financial guarantees, and lending and financing arrangements may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: Years to Maturity Total Lessthan 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) Letters of credit and other financial guarantees(1) $ 5,694 $ 66 $ $ $ 5,760 Investment activities 636 422 8 213 1,279 Investment grade corporate lending commitments(2) 4,023 5,662 17,009 7,612 34,306 Non investment grade corporate lending commitments(2) 1,357 2,881 2,316 11,255 17,809 Commitments for secured lending transactions(3) 9,813 5,879 30 166 15,888 Commitments to purchase mortgage loans(4) 5,062 5,062 Total(5) $ 26,585 $ 14,910 $ 19,363 $ 19,246 $ 80,104 (1) This amount represents the Companys outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to satisfy various collateral requirements. This amount also includes commercial loan commitments to small businesses. (2) The Companys investment grade and non investment grade primary and secondary lending commitments are made in connection with corporate lending and other business activities. Credit ratings for primary commitments are determined by the Companys Institutional Credit Department using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or lower are considered non investment grade. 90 Table of Contents (3) This amount represents lending commitments extended by the Company to companies that are secured by assets of the borrower. Loans made under these arrangements typically are at variable rates and generally provide for over collateralization based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. (4) This amount represents the Companys forward purchase contracts involving mortgage loans. (5) See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The table above does not include commitments to extend credit for consumer loans of approximately $274 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which the Company can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company guarantees the debt and or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. At November 30, 2006, the Company had commitments to enter into reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements of approximately $104 billion and $76 billion, respectively. Principal Investments. Principal investing activities are capital investments in companies, generally for proprietary purposes, to maximize total returns to the Company. The Company has committed to increasing its principal investing activity. At November 30, 2006, the Company had aggregate principal investments with a carrying value of approximately $1.8 billion, which are included within Other assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company intends to make additional investments over time to bring the level of principal investments to approximately $2.5 billion. Regulatory Requirements. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (MS&Co.) and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. (MSDWI) are registered broker dealers and registered futures commission merchants and, accordingly, are subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC, the NYSE and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (MSIL), a London based broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Authority, and MSJS, a Tokyo based broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services Agency. MS&Co., MSDWI, MSIL and MSJS have consistently operated in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). In fiscal 2007, the Company intends to merge MSDWI into MS&Co. Upon completion of the merger, the surviving entity, MS&Co., will be the Companys principal U.S. broker dealer. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC insured financial institutions must maintain (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (leverage ratio), (b) 4% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio) and (c) 8% of total capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (total risk weighted capital ratio). At November 30, 2006, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio and total risk weighted capital ratio of each of the Companys FDIC insured financial institutions exceeded these regulatory minimums. 91 Table of Contents Certain other U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to various securities, commodities and banking regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. These subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their local capital adequacy requirements. Morgan Stanley Derivative Products Inc., the Companys triple A rated derivative products subsidiary, maintains certain operating restrictions that have been reviewed by various rating agencies. Effective December 1, 2005, the Company became a consolidated supervised entity (CSE) as defined by the SEC. As such, the Company is subject to group wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. As of November 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance with the CSE capital requirements. MS&Co. is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of Rule 15c3 1. MS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of November 30, 2006, MS&Co. had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and the notification requirements. Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets, upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. 92 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Risk Management. Risk Management Policy and Control Structure. Risk is an inherent part of the Companys business and activities. The Companys ability to properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability. The Companys broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole. The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in the Companys business activities: market, credit, operational, legal, and liquidity and funding risk. Liquidity and funding risk is discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. The Companys currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The cornerstone of the Companys risk management philosophy is protection of the Companys franchise, reputation and financial standing. The Companys risk management philosophy is based on the following principles: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. Given the importance of effective risk management to the Companys reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters. Risk management at the Company requires independent Company level oversight, accountability of the Companys business segments, constant communication, judgment, and knowledge of specialized products and markets. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segment level. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business, the Companys risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification. The nature of the Companys risks, coupled with this risk management philosophy, informs the Companys risk governance structure. The Companys risk governance structure includes the Firm Risk Committee and the Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee, the Chief Risk Officer, the Internal Audit Department, independent control groups, and various risk control managers, committees and groups located within the business segments. The Firm Risk Committee, composed of the Companys most senior officers, oversees the Companys risk management structure. The Firm Risk Committees responsibilities include oversight of the Companys risk management principles, procedures and limits, and the monitoring of material financial, operational and franchise risks. The Firm Risk Committee is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee). The Capital Structure and Strategic Transactions Committee (the Capital Committee) reviews strategic transactions for the Company and significant changes to the Companys capital structure. The Capital Committees responsibilities include reviewing measures of capital and evaluating capital resources relative to the Companys risk profile and strategy. The Chief Risk Officer, a member of the Firm Risk Committee, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of Company risk limits; reviews material market and credit risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department periodically examines the Companys operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories. 93 Table of Contents The Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Control, Treasury, and Legal and Compliance Departments (collectively, the Company Control Groups), which are all independent of the Companys business units, assist senior management and the Firm Risk Committee in monitoring and controlling the Companys risk through a number of control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Companys risk management and monitoring systems and processes. Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for ensuring that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the Firm Risk Committee; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls. Each of the Companys business segments also has designated operations officers, committees and groups, including operations and information technology groups (collectively, Segment Control Groups and, together with the Company Control Groups, the Control Groups) to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee. The Control Groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the business segments market and credit risk profile, sales practices, pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Control Groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review. The following is a discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (other than liquidity and funding risk). The discussion focuses on the Companys securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and consumer lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Companys market risk exposure generated by the Companys statistical analyses are forward looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below. Market Risk. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business where the substantial majority of the Companys Value at Risk (VaR) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading related market risk within the Global Wealth Management Group. Asset Management incurs non trading market risk primarily from capital investments in funds and investments in private equity vehicles. In its consumer lending activities, Discover is also exposed to non trading market risk primarily through changes in interest rates. Sound market risk management is an integral part of the Companys culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent. The Control Groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Companys risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries 94 Table of Contents and maintains the Companys VaR system. A variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk. Market risk is monitored through various measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to, and discussed with, senior management. Sales and Trading and Related Activities. Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management. During fiscal 2006, the Company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities. The Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). Among the markets in which the Company is active and from which activities those exposures arise are the following: emerging market corporate and government debt, non investment grade and distressed corporate debt, investment grade corporate debt, and asset backed debt. Moreover, some of these markets, such as non investment grade corporate debt, have experienced periods of illiquidity in the past, and may do so in the future. The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions (including positions in non public entities). The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions. The Company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related derivatives. The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Companys aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management. Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management. The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Companys trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing VaR and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses. The Companys trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and the Market Risk Department. The Market Risk Department also conducts scenario analyses, which estimate the Companys revenue sensitivity to a set of specific, predefined market and geopolitical events. Value at Risk (VaR). The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR based risk measures to various levels of management. 95 Table of Contents VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. The Company estimates VaR using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors (market risk factors); and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. The Companys VaR model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Companys 95%/one day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. The Companys VaR model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and interest rate risk, and linear exposures to implied volatility risks. Market risks that are incorporated in the VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities. As a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors, the Companys VaR model uses Monte Carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products (i.e., corporate bonds and credit derivatives). The Companys VaR models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks; reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities; and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodologys limitations, which include the following: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. The Company is aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and control at the trading desk, division and Company levels. VaR for Fiscal 2006. The table below presents the Companys Aggregate (Trading and Non trading), Trading and Non trading VaR for each of the Companys primary market risk exposures at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the Companys trading businesses. This measure of VaR incorporates most of the Companys trading related market risks. However, a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in VaR, and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different VaR results from those produced using more precise measures. For example, risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a VaR context. Aggregate Trading and Non trading VaR also incorporates (a) the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and (b) public company equity positions recorded as investments by the Company. Investments made by the Company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the VaR results reported below. Aggregate 96 Table of Contents Trading and Non trading VaR also excludes certain funding liabilities primarily related to fixed and other non trading assets. As of November 30, 2006, the notional amount of funding liabilities related to non trading assets (including office facilities and other equipment, goodwill, deferred tax assets, and intangible assets) was approximately $7.9 billion, with a duration of approximately 7.3 years. Since the VaR statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days. In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company changed the confidence level at which VaR is reported for limit and other management purposes from a 99% confidence level to a 95% confidence level. The Company believes that for risk management purposes, the 95% VaR statistic is a more useful estimator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The Company also believes this change will facilitate comparisons with other companies in the financial services industry. The table below presents 95%/one day VaR for each of the Companys primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005. Aggregate(Trading and Non trading) Trading Non trading Table 1: 95% Total VaR 95%/One Day VaR at November 30, 95%/One Day VaRat November 30, 95%/One Day VaRat November 30, Primary Market Risk Category 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 41 $ 37 $ 38 $ 34 $ 13 $ 20 Equity price 58 29 55 26 5 7 Foreign exchange rate 9 6 9 6 Commodity price 31 34 31 34 Subtotal 139 106 133 100 18 27 Less diversification benefit(1) 50 45 48 44 3 4 Total VaR $ 89 $ 61 $ 85 $ 56 $ 15 $ 23 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between Total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category. The Companys Aggregate VaR and Trading VaR at November 30, 2006 were $89 million and $85 million, respectively, compared with $61 million and $56 million, respectively, at November 30, 2005. The increase in Aggregate VaR and Trading VaR at year end was driven primarily by increased directional exposure to equity products. Non trading VaR at November 30, 2006 decreased to $15 million from $23 million at November 30, 2005, primarily due to a decrease in Non trading interest rate and credit spread VaR. The overall increase reflects the Companys strategy to grow key businesses, such as its principal investing activities, and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by market conditions. The Company expects to continue to invest in its businesses and to increase its risk profile, provided market opportunities continue to warrant such growth. The Company views average Trading VaR over the fiscal year as more representative of trends in the business than VaR at any single point in time. Table 2 below, which presents the high, low and average 95%/one day Trading VaR during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, represents substantially all of the Companys trading activities. Certain market risks included in the year end Aggregate VaR discussed above are excluded from these measures (e.g., equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the Company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions). 97 Table of Contents Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2006 increased to $60 million from $57 million in fiscal 2005, reflecting increases in equity price VaR and commodity price VaR. The increase in equity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased directional exposure to equity products. The increase in commodity price VaR was predominantly driven by increased exposures to energy products (i.e., natural gas and electricity) and oil products (i.e., crude and distillates). Table 2: 95% High/Low/Average Trading VaR Daily 95%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2006 Daily 95%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2005 Primary Market Risk Category High Low Average High Low Average (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 48 $ 29 $ 35 $ 57 $ 27 $ 37 Equity price 55 21 28 34 18 25 Foreign exchange rate 23 5 9 16 5 8 Commodity price 43 23 30 35 19 26 Trading VaR $ 85 $ 49 $ 60 $ 77 $ 38 $ 57 VaR Statistics Under Varying Assumptions. VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the breadth of products included in each firms VaR model, in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market factors, and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the simulated market conditions. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates for similar portfolios. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms. Table 3 below presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (95% versus 99%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four years versus one year) for market data upon which it bases its simulations: Table 3: Average 95% and 99% Trading VaR with Four Year/One Year Historical Time Series Average 95%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2006 Average 99%/One Day VaR for Fiscal 2006 Primary Market Risk Category Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 35 $ 29 $ 59 $ 44 Equity price 28 28 41 41 Foreign exchange rate 9 9 14 14 Commodity price 30 35 48 69 Trading VaR $ 60 $ 58 $ 92 $ 94 In addition, if the Company were to report Trading VaR (using a four year historical time series) with respect to a 10 day holding period, the Companys 95% and 99% Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2006 would have been $188 million and $291 million, respectively. 98 Table of Contents Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for Fiscal 2006. As shown in Table 2 above, the Companys average 95%/one day Trading VaR for fiscal 2006 was $60 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 95%/one day Trading VaR for fiscal 2006. The most frequently occurring value was between $57 million and $60 million, while for approximately 93% of trading days during the fiscal year, VaR ranged between $51 million and $69 million. One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the Companys VaR model as a measure of the Companys potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra day trading, for a 95%/one day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the fiscal year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the accuracy of the VaR model could be questioned. Accordingly, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results. The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenue during fiscal 2006 for the Companys trading businesses (including net interest and commissions but excluding primary and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses). 99 Table of Contents The Company observed a net trading loss of $87 million on one business day during fiscal 2006, which exceeded the 95%/one day VaR for that day. Consumer Lending and Related Activities. Interest Rate Risk and Management. In its consumer lending activities, the Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations, as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, long term borrowings and deposits. The Companys interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the Companys right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, the Company may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve its objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing. Sensitivity Analysis Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. For its consumer lending activities, the Company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure, one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from its fiscal year end, the Company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. A portion of the Companys credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate, although the Company has the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a 100 Table of Contents new interest rate. Therefore, the Company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. The Company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles. In addition, assets that have a market based index, such as the prime rate, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the Companys normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that have a market based index, such as Fed Funds or LIBOR rates, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of November 30, 2006, it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following 12 month period would be reduced by approximately $125 million. The comparable reduction of pre tax income for the 12 month period following November 30, 2005 was estimated to be approximately $36 million. The increase in the reduction in pre tax income at November 30, 2006 was due to a higher level of variable rate funding. The hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next 12 month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the Company would respond to significant changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the analysis does not necessarily reflect the Companys expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur. Credit Risk. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower, counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations. The Company is exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in its businesses. The Company incurs significant, single name credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities business. This type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis. The Company incurs individual consumer credit risk in the Global Wealth Management Group business through margin loans to individual investors, which are generally collateralized, and loans to small businesses. The Company incurs consumer portfolio credit risk in the Discover business primarily through cardholder receivables. Credit risk in a pool of credit card receivables is generally highly diversified, without significant individual exposures, and, accordingly, is managed on a portfolio and not a single name basis. The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed discretely. The Institutional Credit Department (Institutional Credit) manages credit risk exposure for the Institutional Securities business. Institutional Credit 101 Table of Contents is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure in the Global Wealth Management Group business is managed through various credit risk committees, whose membership includes Institutional Credit. The Global Wealth Management Group Risk Management Department is responsible for monitoring, measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures, including margin loans and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions. Credit risk exposure in the Discover business is managed through the Discover Credit and Market Risk Committee, which, in turn, is supported by business line specific risk committees and the Credit Risk Management Department, which is responsible for the development, validation and implementation of credit policy criteria, for predictive models, for the monitoring of performance for both new and existing products, and for oversight of adherence to existing policies and limits. Institutional Securities Activities. Corporate Lending. In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. These loans and commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, may be secured or unsecured, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated or traded by the Company. The borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade. Credit risk with respect to loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement. Commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused, or may be cancelled or reduced at the request of the counterparty, and, therefore, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. In addition, commitments associated with acquisition financing activities are generally contingent on the completion of the underlying transaction as well as upon various terms and conditions, and also can be short term in nature, as borrowers often replace them with other funding sources. Securitized Products. The Company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, corporate and operating company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value. Other. In addition to the activities performed by Institutional Credit, there are credit risks managed by various business areas within Institutional Securities. For example, certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits. Certain risk management activities as they pertain to establishing appropriate collateral amounts for the Companys prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. Derivative Contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams, exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and equity warrants typically have longer maturities. The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Companys exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, 102 Table of Contents or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities, or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Analyzing Credit Risk. Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, counterparty and portfolio levels. In order to help protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities, Institutional Credit analyzes all material lending and derivative transactions and ensures that the creditworthiness of the Companys counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. Institutional Credit assigns obligor credit ratings to the Companys counterparties and borrowers. These credit ratings are intended to assess a counterpartys probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or below are considered non investment grade. Additionally, for lending transactions, Institutional Credit evaluates the relative position of the Companys particular obligation in the borrowers capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as collateral (if applicable) and other structural elements of the particular transaction. The Company has credit guidelines that limit potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties. Institutional Credit administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits. Risk Mitigation. The Company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments which may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign or sub participate funded loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company may enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements may provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterpartys rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default. Credit Exposure Corporate Lending. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the aggregate value of primary investment grade loans and financial accommodations was $6.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, and the aggregate value of primary non investment grade loans and positions was $3.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, the aggregate value of primary lending commitments outstanding was $49.2 billion and $37.0 billion, respectively. The increase from the prior year was primarily related to acquisition financing activity. In connection with these business activities (which include corporate funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges with a notional amount of $26.5 billion and $17.8 billion at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005, respectively, including both internal and external hedges utilized by the lending business. The table below shows the Companys credit exposure from its corporate lending positions and commitments as of November 30, 2006. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: Corporate Lending Commitments and Funded Loans Years to Maturity Total CorporateLendingExposure(2) CorporateLoans Credit Rating(1) Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) AAA $ 251 $ 120 $ 268 $ $ 639 $ AA 1,452 1,797 2,364 931 6,544 785 A 1,151 2,497 5,886 1,241 10,775 387 BBB 2,246 4,068 9,579 4,780 20,673 5,209 Non investment grade 1,942 3,020 2,851 12,572 20,385 3,414 Total $ 7,042 $ 11,502 $ 20,948 $ 19,524 $ 59,016 $ 9,795 Notional amount of hedges owned $ 26,545 103 Table of Contents (1) Obligor credit ratings are determined by Institutional Credit using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies.

The table does not include the effect of any related hedges utilized by the Company. The table also excludes fair values corresponding to other credit exposures, such as those arising from the Companys lending activities. (2) Obligor credit ratings are determined by Institutional Credit using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. (3) Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity categories. Receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within such maturity category, where appropriate. Cash collateral received is netted on a counterparty basis, provided legal right of offset exists. (4) In lieu of making an individual assessment of the creditworthiness of unrated companies, the Company makes a determination that the collateral held with respect to such obligations is sufficient to cover a substantial portion of its exposure. In making this determination, the Company takes into account various factors, including legal uncertainties and market volatility. The following tables summarize the fair values of the Companys OTC derivative products recorded in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased by product category and maturity at November 30, 2006, including on a net basis, where applicable, reflecting the fair value of related non cash collateral for financial instruments owned: OTC Derivative Products Financial Instruments Owned Years to Maturity Cross Maturity andCash Collateral Netting(1) Net ExposurePost CashCollateral Net ExposurePost Collateral Product Type Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) Interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate options, credit derivatives and other fixed income securities contracts $ 3,804 $ 5,402 $ 8,882 $ 26,351 $ (25,072 ) $ 19,367 $ 16,414 Foreign exchange forward contracts and options 7,333 679 147 23 (869 ) 7,313 5,842 Equity securities contracts (including equity swaps, warrants and options) 4,604 1,924 999 179 (2,890 ) 4,816 2,594 Commodity forwards, options and swaps 4,861 5,109 4,385 2,049 (5,011 ) 11,393 9,245 Total $ 20,602 $ 13,114 $ 14,413 $ 28,602 $ (33,842 ) $ 42,889 $ 34,095 104 Table of Contents (1) Amounts represent the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories.

The Companys derivatives (both listed and OTC) at November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005 are summarized in the table below, showing the fair value of the related assets and liabilities by product: At November 30, 2006 At November 30, 2005 Product Type Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities (dollars in millions) Interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate options, credit derivatives and other fixed income securities contracts $ 19,444 $ 15,688 $ 17,157 $ 13,212 Foreign exchange forward contracts and options 7,325 7,725 7,548 7,597 Equity securities contracts (including equity swaps, warrants and options) 16,705 23,155 7,290 11,957 Commodity forwards, options and swaps 11,969 10,923 13,899 12,186 Total $ 55,443 $ 57,491 $ 45,894 $ 44,952 Each category of OTC derivative products in the above tables includes a variety of instruments, which can differ substantially in their characteristics. Instruments in each category can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in one or more non U.S. currencies. The fair values recorded in the above tables are determined by the Company using various pricing models. For a discussion of fair value as it affects the consolidated financial statements, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies, the structure of the transaction, including its maturity, is one of several important factors that may impact the price transparency. The impact of maturity on price transparency can differ significantly among product categories. For example, single currency and multi currency interest rate derivative products involving highly standardized terms and the major currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar or the euro) will generally have greater price transparency 105 Table of Contents from published external sources even in maturity ranges beyond 20 years. Credit derivatives with highly standardized terms and liquid underlying reference instruments can have price transparency from published external sources in a maturity ranging up to 10 years, while equity and foreign exchange derivative products with standardized terms in major currencies can have price transparency from published external sources within a two year maturity range. Commodity derivatives with standardized terms and delivery locations can have price transparency from published external sources within various maturity ranges up to 10 years, depending on the commodity. In most instances of limited price transparency based on published external sources, dealers in these markets, in their capacities as market makers and liquidity providers, provide price transparency beyond the above maturity ranges. Country Exposure. The Company monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual countries. Credit exposure to a country arises from the Companys lending activities and derivatives activities in a country. At November 30, 2006, approximately 5% of the Companys total credit exposure (including primary corporate loans and lending commitments and current exposure arising from the Companys derivative contracts) was to emerging markets, and no one emerging market country accounted for more than 0.6% of the Companys total credit exposure. Country credit ratings are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Industry Exposure. The Company also monitors its credit exposure and risk to individual industries. At November 30, 2006, the Companys material credit exposure (including primary corporate loans and lending commitments and current exposure arising from the Companys derivative contracts) was to entities engaged in the following industries: utilities, sovereign related entities, financial institutions, media, consumer related entities and healthcare. Global Wealth Management Group Activities. Margin Lending. Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of all margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, possible hedging strategies. Additionally, all transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. At November 30, 2006, there were approximately $6.8 billion of customer margin loans outstanding. Commercial Lending. Global Wealth Management Group provides commercial lending to small and medium size domestic businesses through Morgan Stanley Commercial Financial Services, Inc. (CFS). CFS suite of products include working capital lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and owner occupied commercial real estate mortgages. Clients are required to submit a comprehensive credit application, including financial statements, to CFS centralized credit processing platform. Once the information is received by CFS experienced underwriting professionals, a comprehensive analysis is performed to assess the business model and to determine appropriate structure, guarantors strengths, debt and cash flow capacity, liquidity and collateral coverage. For standard transactions, credit requests are approved via signature of independent credit officers, and where transactions are of size and higher complexity, approval is secured through a formal loan committee chaired by independent credit professionals. The facility is risk rated and upon credit approval is moved to the general portfolio where it is monitored periodically through account management, covenants compliance certificates, and spot and cycle audits. 106 Table of Contents Consumer Lending Activities. With respect to its consumer lending activities, potential credit cardholders undergo credit reviews by the Credit Department of Discover Financial Services to establish that they meet standards of ability and willingness to pay. Credit card applications are evaluated using scoring models (statistical evaluation models) based on information obtained from applicants and credit bureaus. The Companys credit scoring systems include both industry and customized models using the Companys criteria and historical data. Each cardmembers credit line is reviewed at least annually, and actions resulting from such review may include raising or lowering a cardmembers credit line or closing the account. In addition, the Company, on a portfolio basis, performs periodic monitoring and review of consumer behavior and risk profiles. The Company also reviews the creditworthiness of prospective Discover Network merchants and conducts annual reviews of merchants, with the greatest scrutiny given to merchants with substantial sales volume, chargeback, return and discount volumes. With respect to first mortgages and second mortgages within the Companys Institutional Securities business segment, including home equity lines of credit (mortgage lending), a loan evaluation process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting policies and collateral valuation. The Companys underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis of applicable industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., FICO scores), debt ratios and reserves of the borrower. Loan to collateral value ratios are determined based on independent third party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. As part of the mortgage lending business strategy, almost all loans are sold in the secondary market through securitizations and whole loan sales, while almost all servicing rights are retained. These sales and securitizations pass the risk of credit loss onto the purchaser/investor. For further information on the Companys consumer loans, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Operational Risk. Operational risk refers to the risk of financial or other loss, or potential damage to a firms reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, resources and systems or from external events (e.g. external or internal fraud, legal and compliance risks, damage to physical assets, etc.). The Company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g. sales and trading) and support functions (e.g. information technology and facilities management). As such, the Company may incur operational risk in each of its businesses, as well as within the Control Groups. Legal and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under Legal Risk. The goal of the Companys operational risk management framework is to establish firm wide operational risk standards related to risk measurement, monitoring and management. Operational risk policies are designed to reduce the likelihood and or impact of operational incidents as well as to mitigate legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The Companys Operational Risk Manager (ORM) oversees, monitors, measures and analyzes operational risk across the Company. The ORM is also responsible for facilitating, designing, implementing and monitoring the firm wide operational risk program. The ORM is independent of the business segments and is supported by the firm wide Operational Risk Department (ORD). The ORD works with the business segments, Control Groups and other support functions to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Company. Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments and the Control Groups, and the business managers therein. The business managers generally maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. As new products and business activities are developed and processes are designed and modified, operational risks are considered. Each business segment has a designated operational risk coordinator. In addition, business segment risk committees review operational risk matters and or reports on a regular basis. Each Control Group also has a designated operational risk coordinator, or equivalent, and a forum for discussing operational risk matters and or reports with senior 107 Table of Contents management. Oversight of business segment operational risk is provided by business segment risk committees, a firmwide operational risk committee and ultimately senior management through the Firm Risk Committee. Business Continuity Planning is an ongoing program of analysis and planning which ensures a recovery strategy and required resources for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a Company wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of the Companys disaster recovery plans include: crisis management; business segment recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing. The Company maintains an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and satisfies regulatory requirements. Information security procedures are designed to protect the Companys information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These procedures cover a broad range of areas including: application system entitlement; data protection; internet and intranet access, communications and usage; and, mobile and portable information usage. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computer and other assets from unauthorized access. The Company utilizes the services of external vendors in connection with the Companys ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of means, including service level and other contractual agreements, service and quality reviews, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the future. Legal Risk. Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Legal and Compliance Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Companys policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, collection activities, money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company. 108 Table of Contents
