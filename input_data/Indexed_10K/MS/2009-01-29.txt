During fiscal 2008, a severe downturn in the economy led to price declines and a period of unprecedented volatility across various asset classes. Losses that had previously been limited largely to the subprime mortgage sector during fiscal 2007 spread to residential and commercial mortgages during fiscal 2008 as property prices declined rapidly. The effect of the economic and market downturn also spread to other areas of the credit market, including investment grade and non investment grade corporate debt, convertible securities, emerging market debt and equity, and leveraged loans. The magnitude of these declines led to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector as a result of concerns about the capital base and viability of certain financial institutions. During this period, interbank lending and commercial paper borrowing fell sharply, precipitating a credit freeze for both institutional and individual borrowers. In the U.S., credit conditions worsened considerably over the course of the year, and the U.S. entered into a recession (as announced by the National Bureau of Economic Research) and the credit crisis assumed global proportions. The landscape of the U.S. financial services industry changed dramatically, especially during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman Brothers) declared bankruptcy, and many major U.S. financial institutions consolidated, were forced to merge or were put into conservatorship by the U.S. Federal Government, including The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., Wachovia Corporation, WashingtonMutual, Inc., Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). In addition, the U.S. Federal Government provided a loan to American International Group Inc. (AIG) in exchange for an equity interest in AIG. In September 2008, following Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, the Company and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. each experienced significantly wider credit spreads on their outstanding debt and sharp declines in stock market capitalization and subsequently received approval from the Fed to become bank holding companies. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (initially introduced as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP) was enacted. On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Department of Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) announced its intention to inject capital into nine large U.S. financial institutions, including the Company, under the TARP Capital Purchase Program (the CPP) and since has injected capital into many other financial institutions. In November 2008, the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Fed provided additional assistance to Citi, including an additional capital injection and a government guarantee on certain troubled assets, in exchange for preferred stock as well as other corporate governance measures. The U.S. unemployment rate at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 6.7% from 4.7% at the end of fiscal 2007, reaching the highest level in the last fifteen years. In the U.S., equity market indices ended the fiscal year period significantly lower. Concerns about future economic growth, the adverse developments in the credit markets, mixed views about the U.S. Federal Governments response to the economic crisis, including the CPP, lower levels of consumer spending, a high rate of unemployment and lower corporate earnings continued to challenge the U.S. economy and the equity markets. Adverse developments in the credit markets, including failed auctions for auction rate securities (ARS), rising default rates on residential mortgages, extremely high implied default rates on commercial mortgages and liquidity issues underlying short term investment products, such as structured investment vehicles and money market funds, weighed heavily as well on equity markets. Oil prices also reached record levels during fiscal 2008 before declining sharply, partly due to lower demand and weaker economic conditions. During fiscal 2008, the Fed announced a number of initiatives aimed to provide additional liquidity and stability to the financial markets, and the Fed continues to focus its efforts on mitigating the negative economic impact related to the credit markets. The Fed announced enhancements to its programs to provide additional liquidity to the asset backed commercial paper and money markets, and the Fed has indicated that it plans to purchase from primary dealers short term debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Fed has established a commercial paper funding facility in order to provide additional liquidity to the short term debt markets. The Fed continues to consult frequently with its global central bank counterparts and 41 Table of Contents during fiscal 2008, a number of coordinated benchmark interest rate reductions were announced by central banks globally. The Fed lowered both the federal funds benchmark rate and the discount rate by 3.50% during fiscal 2008, and at fiscal year end the federal funds target rate was 1.00% and the discount rate was 1.25%. Also, during fiscal 2008, the Fed lowered the primary credit rate by 0.25%. In an additional effort to unlock credit markets, the Fed, the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC announced that the FDIC will temporarily guarantee certain senior unsecured debt issued by FDIC insured institutions and their U.S. bank holding companies, subject to certain conditions. In December 2008, the Fed lowered both the federal funds benchmark rate and the discount rate by 0.75% to 0.25% and 0.50%, respectively, and rates remained at historically low levels. In Europe, the unemployment rate rose and economic growth continued to slow during fiscal 2008 as export demand decreased, housing prices declined, consumer spending and business investment slowed, and the disruption in the global financial markets continued. In Europe, equity market indices were lower at the end of the fiscal year. Concerns about the economic outlook and difficult conditions in the credit markets continued to challenge the European economy and the equity markets. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, the European Central Bank (ECB) indicated that it remained concerned about global inflation and raised the benchmark interest rate by 0.25% to 4.25%, while the Bank of England (BOE) decreased the benchmark interest rate by an aggregate of 0.75% to 5.00%. In September 2008, the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy triggered additional credit disruptions, European governments intervened to support large financial institutions and financial services companies within Europe began to consolidate as lending conditions among European banks worsened. After September 2008, global central banks worked collaboratively to reduce interest rates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the ECB lowered its benchmark interest rates by 1.00% to 3.25% and the BOE lowered its benchmark interest rate by 2.00% to 3.00%. In December 2008, the ECB lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.75% to 2.50% and the BOE lowered its benchmark interest rate by 1.00% to 2.00%. In January 2009, the ECB lowered its benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.50% to 2.00%, and the BOE lowered its benchmark interest rate by an additional 0.50% to a historically low 1.50%. In Asia, the global credit and financial crisis that began in the U.S. and spread throughout Europe adversely impacted the demand for Asian exports, in Japan as well as in emerging markets across Asia. The level of unemployment in Japan, which began the fiscal year at relatively low levels began to rise. Major Asian equity market indices ended fiscal 2008 lower. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) lowered the benchmark interest rate by 0.2% to 0.3% during fiscal 2008, and in December 2008, the BOJ reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.2% to 0.1%. Economies elsewhere in Asia had slower growth, particularly in China and India, due to a lower level of exports, which more than offset domestic demand for capital projects and domestic consumption. Central banks across Asia that previously had relatively high benchmark interest rates, such as Australia, China and India, have all significantly lowered their benchmark interest rates, along with global central bank coordinated interest rate reductions. Overview of Fiscal 2008 Financial Results. The Company recorded net income of $1,707 million in fiscal 2008, a 47% decrease from $3,209 million in the prior year. Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense) decreased 12% to $24,739 million in fiscal 2008. Non interest expenses decreased 9% to $22,452 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower compensation costs, partly offset by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 26%, primarily reflecting lower incentive based compensation accruals due to lower net revenues in certain of the Companys businesses. Diluted earnings per share were $1.45 compared with $2.98 a year ago. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54 compared with $2.37 last year. The return on average common equity in fiscal 2008 was 4.9% compared with 8.9% in the prior year. The return on average common equity from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was 5.2% compared with 7.8% in fiscal 2007. The Companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 21.0% in fiscal 2008 compared with 24.5% in fiscal 2007. The decrease primarily reflected lower earnings and a change in the geographic mix of earnings, partly offset by an increase in the rate due to the goodwill impairment charges (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). 42 Table of Contents Institutional Securities. Institutional Securities recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes of $2,925 million, a 280% increase from a year ago. Net revenues increased 3% to $16,622 million. The increase in net revenues reflected record equity sales and trading results, higher fixed income sales and trading results, primarily due to lower net mortgage related losses, gains related to the repurchase of the Companys debt, pre tax gains related to two secondary offerings of MSCI Inc. and the widening of credit spreads on the Companys borrowings for which the fair value option was elected, partially offset by net losses from investments in passive limited partnership interests and lower results in investment banking. Non interest expenses decreased 11% to $13,697 million, primarily due to lower compensation costs, partially offset by higher non compensation expenses. Non compensation expenses increased 24%, primarily due to a charge of approximately $694 million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to certain fixed income businesses. Investment banking revenues decreased 34% to $3,630 million from last year due to lower revenues from advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions and lower revenues from underwriting transactions. Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,740 million, a decrease of 32% from fiscal 2007. Underwriting revenues decreased 37% from last year to $1,890 million. The decrease in investment banking revenues reflected the unprecedented market turmoil in fiscal 2008 that significantly reduced levels of market activity. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 10% to a record $9,968 million and reflected higher net revenues from derivative products and slightly higher results in prime brokerage. Equity sales and trading also benefited by approximately $1.6 billion from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long term and short term borrowings accounted for at fair value. Fiscal 2008 reflected lower revenues from principal trading strategies. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were $3,862 million in fiscal 2008 from $268 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 results reflected lower losses in mortgage loan products, record revenues from commodities and record results in foreign exchange products, partially offset by lower net revenues from the interest rate and credit businesses, reflecting the continued dislocation in the credit markets and unfavorable positioning. In addition, fixed income sales and trading benefited by approximately $3.5 billion from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long term and short term borrowings that are accounted for at fair value. In fiscal 2008, other sales and trading losses of approximately $3,133 million reflected mark to market losses on loans and commitments that were partly offset by gains on related hedges. Fiscal 2008 also included losses related to mortgage related securities portfolios in the Companys domestic subsidiary banks. In addition, other sales and trading losses included mark to market gains on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company (i.e., the swaps were de designated as hedges). During the period the swaps were hedging the debt, changes in fair value of these instruments were generally offset by adjustments to the basis of the debt being hedged. Principal transaction net investment losses aggregating $2,477 million were recognized in fiscal 2008 compared with net investment gains of $1,459 million in fiscal 2007. The losses were primarily related to net realized and unrealized losses from the Companys investments in passive limited partnership interests associated with the Companys real estate funds and investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co investment plans, and other principal investments. Global Wealth Management Group. Global Wealth Management Group recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes of $1,154 million compared with $1,155 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 included a pre tax gain of $687 million related to the sale of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management S.V., S.A.U. (MSWM S.V.), the Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Fiscal 2008 also included a charge of $532 million associated with the ARS repurchase program and $108 million associated with subsequent writedowns of some of these securities that have been repurchased (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Net revenues were $7,019 million, a 6% increase over a year ago, primarily related to the previously mentioned sale of MSWM S.V. and higher net interest revenues from growth in the bank deposit program. The increase in net revenues was partly offset by 43 Table of Contents lower revenues from asset management, distribution and administration fees and lower investment banking revenues. The decline in asset management revenues reflected a change in the classification of sub advisory fees due to modifications of certain customer agreements, the discontinuance of the Companys fee based (fee in lieu of commission) brokerage program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 pursuant to a court decision vacating an SEC rule that permitted fee based brokerage and asset depreciation. Client assets in fee based accounts decreased 32% from a year ago to $136 billion and decreased as a percentage of total client assets to 25% from last years 27%. In addition, total client assets decreased to $546 billion, down 28% from the prior fiscal year end, primarily due to asset depreciation. Total non interest expenses were $5,865 million, a 7% increase from a year ago. Compensation and benefits expense remained flat in fiscal 2008, as severance related expenses of $41 million and investment in the business were offset by lower incentive based compensation accruals. Non compensation costs increased 25%, primarily due to the charge of $532 million for the ARS. In addition, fiscal 2007 included an insurance reimbursement related to a litigation matter. The increase in non compensation costs was partly offset by a change in the classification of sub advisory fees due to modifications of certain customer agreements. As of November 30, 2008, the number of global representatives was 8,426. Asset Management. Asset Management recorded losses before income taxes of $1,807 million in fiscal 2008 compared with income before income taxes of $1,467 million in fiscal 2007. Net revenues of $1,292 million decreased 76% from the prior year. The decrease in fiscal 2008 primarily reflected principal transaction net investment losses of $1,661 million compared with gains of $1,774 million a year ago. The losses in fiscal 2008 were primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys merchant banking business, which includes the real estate, private equity and infrastructure businesses, and losses associated with certain investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. The decrease in fiscal 2008 was also due to lower asset management, distribution and administration fees, primarily due to lower performance fees from alternative investment products, lower distribution fees, and lower fund management and administration fees reflecting a decrease in average assets under management. Assets under management or supervision within Asset Management of $399 billion were down $198 billion, or 33%, from last year, primarily reflecting decreases in equity and fixed income products resulting from market depreciation and net outflows. Non interest expenses decreased 23% from the prior year to $3,099 million. Compensation and benefits expense decreased primarily due to lower net revenues and losses associated with principal investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. The decrease in compensation expense in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by severance related expenses of $97 million. The decrease in non interest expenses was partly offset by an impairment charge of $243 million related to Crescent Real Estate Equities Limited Partnership (Crescent). Strategic Initiatives. The Company has launched several strategic initiatives to further improve its position in the rapidly changing market environment, including: Targeting capital to businesses where the Company believes it will have better risk adjusted returns, including flow trading, equity derivatives, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities; Engaging in a reduction of balance sheet intensive businesses within the Institutional Securities business segment, including a resizing of prime brokerage and the exit from select proprietary trading strategies; Targeting an additional $2 billion in cost savings, including the annualized effect of the previously announced headcount reductions and additional non compensation expense savings in 2009; Developing a global alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG), Japans largest banking group, and pursuing initiatives in corporate and investment banking, retail banking and lending activities; Launching a Retail Banking business to build bank deposits leveraging the Companys existing retail banking capabilities and financial holding company structure; and Forming the largest wealth management business firm with Citi, as measured by financial advisors, through a joint venture (see Recent Business Developments herein). 44 Table of Contents Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations. The Companys results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors. In addition, results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors of a global nature, including political and economic conditions and geopolitical events; the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income and credit markets, including corporate and mortgage (commercial and residential) lending; the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; the availability and cost of both credit and capital as well as the credit ratings assigned to the Companys unsecured short term and long term debt; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; the Companys reputation; the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors; and the impact of current, pending and future legislation, regulation, and technological changes in the U.S. and worldwide. Such factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect the Companys business, see Competition and Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. The following items significantly affected the Companys results in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Corporate Lending. The results for fiscal 2008 included net losses of approximately $3.3 billion (consisting of negative mark to market valuations and losses of approximately $6.3 billion net of gains on related hedges of approximately $3.0 billion) associated with loans and lending commitments largely related to event driven lending to non investment grade companies. These losses were primarily related to the illiquid market conditions that existed during the year. The results for fiscal 2007 included losses of approximately $700 million, primarily recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 that reflected mark to market valuations associated with loans and lending commitments largely related to event driven lending to non investment grade companies. The losses included markdowns of leveraged lending commitments associated with event driven lending transactions that were accepted by the borrower but not yet closed. These losses were primarily related to the illiquid market conditions that existed during the second half of fiscal 2007. Mortgage Related Trading Losses. In fiscal 2008, the Company recorded mortgage related losses of approximately $1.7 billion. The $1.7 billion included losses on non subprime residential mortgages of approximately $2.6 billion, partially offset by gains on commercial mortgage backed securities and commercial whole loan positions of approximately $800 million and gains of approximately $100 million on U.S. subprime mortgage proprietary trading exposures. See Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions herein for information relating to the Companys mortgage related trading exposures. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded $9.0 billion of mortgage related writedowns resulting from an unfavorable subprime mortgage related trading strategy and the deterioration and lack of market liquidity for subprime and other mortgage related instruments. The writedowns included $7.8 billion related to U.S. subprime trading positions, principally super senior derivative positions in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These derivative positions were entered into primarily by the Companys mortgage proprietary trading group. As the credit markets in general, and the mortgage markets in particular, declined dramatically in the fourth quarter, increases in the implied cumulative losses in the subprime mortgage market, coupled with the illiquid nature of the Companys trading positions, led to a significant deterioration in value in its subprime related trading positions. The writedowns in fiscal 2007 also included $1.2 billion related to commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), Alt A mortgages (a categorization that falls between prime and subprime due to certain loan characteristics) and other loans, conduit and non performing loans and European non conforming loans. Subsidiary Banks. The Company recorded losses of approximately $900 million in fiscal 2008 related to mortgage related securities portfolios of Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Trust (collectively, the 45 Table of Contents Subsidiary Banks). See Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions Subsidiary Banks herein for further information on these securities portfolios. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the securities in the Subsidiary Banks portfolios were classified as securities available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS No. 115). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company determined that it no longer intended to hold these securities until the fair value of the securities recovered to a level that exceeded their initial cost. Accordingly, the Company recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of $437 million in Principal transactions trading revenues in the consolidated statement of income on its portfolio of securities available for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and reclassified the portfolios to Financial instruments owned in the consolidated statement of financial condition effective November 30, 2007. Auction Rate Securities. Under the terms of various agreements entered into with government agencies and the terms of the Companys announced offer to repurchase, the Company agreed to repurchase at par certain ARS held by retail clients that were purchased through the Company. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse retail clients who have sold certain ARS purchased through the Company at a loss. Fiscal 2008 reflected charges of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program and writedowns of $108 million associated with ARS held in inventory (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Monoline Insurers. Monoline insurers (Monolines) provide credit enhancement to capital markets transactions. Fiscal 2008 included losses of $1.7 billion related to monoline exposures. The current credit environment severely affected the capacity of such financial guarantors. The Companys direct exposure to Monolines is limited to bonds that are insured by Monolines and to derivative contracts with a Monoline as counterparty. The Companys exposure to Monolines at November 30, 2008 consisted primarily of asset backed securities (ABS) bonds of approximately $700 million in the Subsidiary Banks portfolio that are collateralized primarily by first and second lien subprime mortgages enhanced by financial guarantees, $3.1 billion in insured municipal bond securities and approximately $500 million in net counterparty exposure (gross exposure of approximately $8.0 billion net of cumulative credit valuation adjustments of approximately $3.8 billion and net of hedges). The Companys exposure to Monolines at November 30, 2007 consisted primarily of ABS bonds of $1.5 billion in the Subsidiary Banks portfolio, $1.3 billion in insured municipal bond securities and $800 million in net counterparty exposure. The Companys hedging program for Monoline risk includes the use of both CDSs and transactions that effectively mitigate certain market risk components of existing underlying transactions with the Monolines. The increase in the Companys exposure to Monolines from November 30, 2007 was primarily due to the ARS repurchase program as previously mentioned, as many ARS are insured by Monolines. Structured Investment Vehicles. The Company recognized losses of $470 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $129 million in fiscal 2007 related to securities issued by structured investment vehicles (SIVs) included in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition (see Asset Management herein). Real Estate Holdings and Real Estate Investor Funds. Principal transaction net investment revenues in fiscal 2008 included losses related to real estate holdings and investor funds. Approximately $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion of these losses were recognized in the Institutional Securities and Asset Management business segments, respectively. Losses in the Institutional Securities business segment were related to net realized and unrealized losses from the Companys investments in passive limited partnership interests associated with the Companys real estate funds. Losses in the Asset Management business segment included writedowns on its investment in Crescent of approximately $250 million prior to the Company consolidating its assets and liabilities in fiscal 2008. These writedowns are reflected in Principal transactions investments in the consolidated statement of income. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $243 million related to Crescent, which is reflected in Other expenses in the consolidated statement of income. See Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions herein for further information. 46 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangibles. Fiscal 2008 included impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets of $725 million (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Given the future uncertainty in the performance of financial market and economic conditions, the Company will perform an interim impairment test as necessary in 2009, which could result in additional impairment charges. Morgan Stanley Debt. Net revenues benefited by approximately $5.6 billion and $840 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on certain long term and short term borrowings, including structured notes and junior subordinated debentures, that are accounted for at fair value. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded gains of approximately $2.3 billion from repurchasing its debt in the open market and mark to market gains of approximately $1.4 billion on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company (i.e., the swaps were de designated as hedges). During the period the swaps were hedging the debt, changes in fair value of these instruments were generally offset by adjustments to the basis of the debt being hedged. Sales of Subsidiaries and Other Items. Results for fiscal 2008 included a pre tax gain of $1.5 billion related to the secondary offerings of MSCI Inc. and a pre tax gain of $687 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V. (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Results for fiscal 2007 included a gain of $168 million ($109 million after tax) in discontinued operations related to the sale of Quilter Holdings Ltd. on February 28, 2007 (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements) and the $360 million reversal of the Coleman (Parent) Holdings Inc. (Coleman) litigation reserve. Capital Related Transactions. During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into several capital related transactions that increased shareholders equity and long term borrowings by approximately $24.6 billion. Such transactions included the sale of equity units (the Equity Units) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the China Investment Corporation Ltd. (CIC) for approximately $5.6 billion and the issuance to MUFG of shares of Series B Non Cumulative Non Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock and shares of Series C Non Cumulative Non Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock for a total of $9 billion. In addition, the Company, as part of the CPP, issued to the U.S. Treasury 10,000,000 shares of Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 65,245,759 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $10 billion. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these capital related transactions. 47 Table of Contents Business Segments. Substantially all of the Companys operating revenues and operating expenses can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures. As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Income before taxes in Intersegment Eliminations represents the effect of timing differences associated with the revenue and expense recognition of commissions paid by the Asset Management business segment to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment associated with sales of certain products and the related compensation costs paid to the Global Wealth Management Group business segments global representatives. Income from continuing operations before income taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations was $15 million, $2 million and $23 million in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Included in the results of Intersegment Eliminations for fiscal 2007 is a $25 million advisory fee related to the Discover Spin off that was eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the results in the Institutional Securities business segment for fiscal 2006 included a $30 million advisory fee related to the Companys sale of its former aircraft leasing business that was eliminated in consolidation. 48 Table of Contents INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2008 Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 3,630 $ 5,538 $ 4,228 Principal transactions: Trading 5,194 2,740 11,326 Investments (2,477 ) 1,459 1,081 Commissions 3,100 3,262 2,606 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 142 103 73 Other 4,630 936 404 Total non interest revenues 14,219 14,038 19,718 Interest and dividends 39,359 59,131 42,106 Interest expense 36,956 57,067 40,754 Net interest 2,403 2,064 1,352 Net revenues 16,622 16,102 21,070 Total non interest expenses 13,697 15,332 13,388 Income before income taxes 2,925 770 7,682 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 724 (170 ) 2,213 Net income $ 2,201 $ 940 $ 5,469 Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues are comprised of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans. Investment banking revenues were as follows: Fiscal2008 Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 (dollars in millions) Advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions $ 1,740 $ 2,541 $ 1,753 Equity underwriting revenues 1,045 1,570 1,059 Fixed income underwriting revenues 845 1,427 1,416 Total investment banking revenues $ 3,630 $ 5,538 $ 4,228 Investment banking revenues decreased 34% in fiscal 2008, reflecting the unprecedented market turmoil in fiscal 2008 that significantly reduced levels of market activity. This contrasts to fiscal 2007, when investment banking revenues increased 31% from fiscal 2006 and reached record levels, reflecting a more favorable market environment with higher levels of advisory and capital raising activity. In fiscal 2008, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,740 million, a decrease of 32% from fiscal 2007. Advisory fees in fiscal 2008 reflected lower levels of activity due to the challenging market environment. In fiscal 2007, advisory fees from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions increased 45% to a record $2,541 million, primarily reflecting a strong volume of transaction activity. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 33% to $1,045 million in fiscal 2008, reflecting significantly lower levels of market activity, particularly for initial public offerings. Equity underwriting revenues increased 48% to a record $1,570 million in fiscal 2007, reflecting higher global industry wide equity and equity related activity. 49 Table of Contents Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 41% to $845 million in fiscal 2008 and increased 1% to $1,427 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 revenues were impacted by significantly lower levels of market activity across most products, particularly loan syndications and securitized products. The 1% increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to strong revenues from underwriting investment grade corporate products, which was partially offset by declines in other debt products, primarily non investment grade. At the end of fiscal 2008, the backlog for investment banking transactions was lower across most products as compared with the end of fiscal 2007, reflecting difficult market conditions. The backlog of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions and equity and fixed income underwriting transactions is subject to the risk that transactions may not be completed due to challenging or unforeseen economic and market conditions, adverse developments regarding one of the parties to the transaction, a failure to obtain required regulatory approval or a decision on the part of the parties involved not to pursue a transaction. Sales and Trading Revenues. Sales and trading revenues are composed of principal transaction trading revenues, commissions and net interest revenues (expenses). In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views principal trading, commissions and net interest revenues (expenses) in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions, and other related expenses. The components of the Companys sales and trading revenues are described below: Principal TransactionsTrading. Principal transaction trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions, as well as proprietary trading activities for its own account. Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over the counter (OTC) equity securities and options. Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions. Total sales and trading revenues increased 33% and decreased 47% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2008 reflected higher equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher losses in other sales and trading revenue. 50 Table of Contents Sales and trading revenues can also be analyzed as follows: Fiscal2008(1) Fiscal2007(1) Fiscal2006(1) (dollars in millions) Equity $ 9,968 $ 9,040 $ 6,549 Fixed income 3,862 268 9,023 Other (3,133 ) (1,242 ) (288 ) Total sales and trading revenues $ 10,697 $ 8,066 $ 15,284 (1) Amounts include Principal transactions trading, Commissions and Net interest revenues (expenses). Other sales and trading net revenues primarily include net losses from loans and lending commitments and related hedges associated with the Companys investment banking, corporate lending and other corporate activities. All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Equity Sales and Trading Revenues. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 10% to a record $9,968 million in fiscal 2008 and reflected record net revenues from derivative products and slightly higher results in prime brokerage. Equity sales and trading revenues also benefited from the widening of the Companys credit spreads on financial instruments that are accounted for at fair value, including, but not limited to, those for which the fair value option was elected pursuant to SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159) on December 1, 2006 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Equity sales and trading revenues reflected approximately $1.6 billion due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads during fiscal 2008 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of certain of the Companys long term and short term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected. Revenues from derivative products reflected higher customer flows and high levels of volatility. Principal trading strategies reflected significantly lower revenues in fiscal 2008 as the Company exited select proprietary trading strategies. Although prime brokerage revenues increased in fiscal 2008, in the fourth quarter, the Companys prime brokerage business experienced significant outflows as clients withdrew their cash balances and reallocated positions. These outflows have had a negative impact on prime brokerages operating results in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 equity sales and trading revenues also reflected unrealized losses of approximately $300 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the counterparties credit default spreads. The Company also recorded unrealized gains of approximately $125 million in fiscal 2008 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized losses and gains do not reflect any gains or losses on related non derivative hedging instruments. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 38% to a then record $9,040 million in fiscal 2007, benefiting from international revenues. The increase was driven by higher revenues from derivative products, prime brokerage and equity cash and financing products, partially offset by trading losses in quantitative strategies resulting from unfavorable positioning. Revenues from derivative products benefited from strong customer flows. Prime brokerage generated increased revenues, reflecting continued growth in global client asset balances. Higher revenues from financing products were primarily due to higher commission revenues driven by strong market volumes. Equity sales and trading revenues also reflected approximately $390 million due to the widening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the decrease in the fair value of certain of the Companys long term and short term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected. Fixed Income Sales and Trading Revenues. Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased to $3,862 million in fiscal 2008 from $268 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 results reflected lower losses in mortgage loan products, record revenues from commodities and record results in foreign exchange products, partially offset by lower net revenues from the interest rate and credit businesses. Interest rate, currency and credit products revenues decreased 55% in fiscal 2008. Continued dislocation in the credit markets resulted in lower net revenues from credit products including losses of $1.7 billion related to exposure to monoline insurers (see 51 Table of Contents Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations Monoline Insurers herein) and unfavorable positioning, partially offset by higher revenues from foreign exchange products and strong results in interest rate products. Record results in foreign exchange products were primarily due to higher levels of customer flows and market volatility. Mortgage related losses of approximately $1.7 billion were primarily due to a broadening decline in the residential and commercial mortgage sector. The decline in the Companys mortgage loan product activities reflected the difficult credit market conditions in fiscal 2008. See Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions herein for further information. Commodity revenues increased 62%, primarily due to higher revenues from oil liquids and electricity and natural gas products, reflecting higher market volatility and strong customer flow. Fixed income sales and trading revenues also benefited in fiscal 2008 by approximately $3.5 billion from the widening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the decrease in the fair value of certain of the Companys long term and short term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected. Fiscal 2008 fixed income sales and trading revenues reflected unrealized losses of approximately $6.6 billion related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the counterparties credit default spreads. The Company also recorded unrealized gains of approximately $2.0 billion in fiscal 2008, related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads. The unrealized losses and gains do not reflect any gains or losses on related non derivative hedging instruments. Fixed income sales and trading revenues decreased 97% to $268 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 results reflected significant losses in credit products and lower results in commodities, partially offset by record results in interest rate and currency products. Credit product revenues decreased $9.4 billion, primarily reflecting mortgage related writedowns of $7.8 billion, reflecting the deterioration in value of U.S. subprime trading positions, principally super senior derivative positions in CDOs entered into primarily by the Companys mortgage proprietary trading group. Spread widening, lower liquidity and higher volatility resulted in lower origination, securitization and trading results across most credit product groups and also adversely affected the performance of the Companys hedging strategies. The Companys residential and commercial mortgage loan activities contributed to the significant decline in credit product revenues, reflecting the difficult market conditions, as well as continued concerns in the subprime mortgage loan sector. Interest rate, credit and currency products revenues increased 16% in fiscal 2007, reflecting higher revenues from interest rate, emerging markets and foreign exchange products. Commodity revenues decreased 33%, primarily due to lower trading results from oil liquids, electricity and natural gas products and lower revenues recognized on structured transactions. Fixed income sales and trading revenues also benefited from gains on interest rate derivatives. Fixed income sales and trading revenues also benefited in fiscal 2007 by approximately $450 million from the widening of the Companys credit spreads resulting from the decrease in the fair value of certain of the Companys long term and short term borrowings, primarily structured notes, for which the fair value option was elected. In addition to the equity and fixed income sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues included other trading revenues, consisting primarily of certain activities associated with the Companys corporate lending activities. In connection with its corporate lending activities, the Company provides to select clients loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) that are generally classified as either event driven or relationship driven. Event driven loans and commitments refer to activities associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition or recapitalization transactions. Relationship driven loans and lending commitments are generally made to expand business relationships with select clients. For further information about the Companys corporate lending activities, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. The Companys corporate lending business intends to distribute its current positions; however, this is taking substantially longer than in the past due to market conditions. Widening credit spreads for non investment grade loans have resulted in significant writedowns in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, and further deterioration could result in additional writedowns for these loans and lending commitments in excess of hedges. The fair value measurement of loans and lending commitments takes into account certain fee income that is attributable to the contingent commitment contract. 52 Table of Contents In fiscal 2008, other sales and trading losses were approximately $3.1 billion. Included in the $3.1 billion were net losses of $3.3 billion (negative mark to market valuations and losses of $6.3 billion, net of gains on related hedges of $3.0 billion) associated with loans and lending commitments largely related to certain event driven lending to non investment grade companies. The valuation of these commitments could change in future periods depending on, among other things, the extent that they are renegotiated or repriced or if the associated acquisition transaction does not occur. The $3.1 billion also included writedowns of securities of approximately $1.2 billion in the Companys Subsidiary Banks. For further information, see Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions Subsidiary Banks herein. In addition, other sales and trading losses included mark to market gains of approximately $1.4 billion on certain swaps previously designated as hedges of a portion of the Companys long term debt. These swaps were no longer considered hedges once the related debt was repurchased by the Company (i.e., the swaps were de designated as hedges). During the period the swaps were hedging the debt, changes in fair value of these instruments were generally offset by adjustments to the basis of the debt being hedged. In fiscal 2007, other sales and trading losses of approximately $1.2 billion primarily reflected approximately $700 million of mark to market valuations associated with loans and commitments largely related to event driven lending to non investment grade companies and the impairment charge related to securities in the Companys Subsidiary Banks. The losses included markdowns of leveraged lending commitments associated with event driven lending transactions that were accepted by the borrower but not yet closed. These losses were primarily related to the illiquid market conditions that existed during the second half of fiscal 2007. Principal Transactions Investments. The Companys investments generally are held for long term appreciation. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. Principal transaction net investment losses aggregating $2,477 million were recognized in fiscal 2008 as compared with net investment gains aggregating $1,459 million and $1,081 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. The losses in fiscal 2008 were primarily related to net realized and unrealized losses from the Companys investments in passive limited partnership interests associated with the Companys real estate funds and investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co investment plans and other principal investments. The increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily related to realized and unrealized net gains associated with certain of the Companys investments, including Grifols S.A. and Bovespa Holdings S.A., and higher revenues from the Companys investments in passive limited partnership interests associated with the Companys real estate funds. The increase in fiscal 2007 also reflected higher revenues primarily due to the appreciation of investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. Fiscal 2006s results primarily reflected net gains associated with the Companys investments. Other. Other revenues increased 395% in fiscal 2008 and 132% in fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2008 reflected revenues related to Institutional Securities share (approximately $2.1 billion) of the Companys repurchase of debt (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations Morgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion) and two secondary offerings of MSCI Inc. totaling approximately $1.5 billion (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Fiscal 2008 also included a gain associated with the sale of a controlling interest in a previously consolidated commodities subsidiary. The increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to revenues related to the operation of pipelines, terminals and barges and higher sales of benchmark indices and portfolio risk performance analytic products. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses decreased 11% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower compensation expense. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 28%, primarily reflecting lower incentive based compensation accruals due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by severance related expenses of $653 million in fiscal 2008. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 24%. Fiscal 2008 results included a charge of approximately $694 million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to certain fixed income businesses (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial 53 Table of Contents statements), and fiscal 2007s results included a reversal of the $360 million legal accrual related to the Companys favorable outcome from the Coleman litigation. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 27%, primarily due to higher depreciation expense on property and equipment and higher costs associated with exiting certain property lease agreements. Information processing and communications expense increased 5% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher data processing costs and market data. Marketing and business development expense decreased 7%, primarily due to lower levels of business activity. Other expenses increased 141%, reflecting the previously mentioned charge of approximately $694 million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and the legal reversal of $360 million in fiscal 2007 as previously mentioned, partially offset by lower minority interest. Non interest expenses increased 15% in fiscal 2007. Compensation and benefits expense increased 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation accruals for certain businesses. The increase also reflected higher costs associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, partially offset by Institutional Securities share ($190 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement eligible employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 24%, reflecting increased levels of business activity and expenses associated with acquired businesses. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 33%, primarily due to higher rent and occupancy costs in Europe, Asia and the U.S. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 30%, primarily reflecting substantially increased equity and fixed income trading activity. Marketing and business development expense increased 27%, primarily due to a higher level of business activity. Professional services expense increased 6%, primarily due to higher legal and consulting costs related to increased business activity. Other expenses increased 51%, reflecting costs associated with the subsidiaries acquired in September and December 2006, partially offset by lower net litigation accruals. Fiscal 2007 results included a reversal of the $360 million legal accrual related to the Companys favorable outcome from the Coleman litigation. Fiscal 2006 included legal accruals related to the pending settlement of General American litigation, which was partially offset by a favorable outcome related to the LVMH litigation. 54 Table of Contents GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2008 Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 427 $ 625 $ 428 Principal transactions: Trading 613 598 487 Investments (54 ) 29 57 Commissions 1,408 1,433 1,168 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,726 3,067 2,757 Other 965 163 130 Total non interest revenues 6,085 5,915 5,027 Interest and dividends 1,239 1,221 1,004 Interest expense 305 511 519 Net interest 934 710 485 Net revenues 7,019 6,625 5,512 Total non interest expenses 5,865 5,470 5,004 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,154 1,155 508 Provision for income taxes 440 459 167 Income from continuing operations $ 714 $ 696 $ 341 Investment Banking. Global Wealth Management Group investment banking includes revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed end funds and unit trusts, which are generally earned from offerings underwritten by the Institutional Securities business segment. Investment banking revenues decreased 32% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower underwriting activity across equity and unit trust products, partially offset by an increase in fixed income underwriting activity. Investment banking revenues increased 46% in fiscal 2007, primarily due to strong underwriting activity across equity, fixed income and unit trust products. Principal Transactions Trading. Principal transactions include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys inventory positions held, primarily to facilitate customer transactions. Principal transaction trading revenues increased 3% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to higher revenues from municipal, corporate and government fixed income securities, partially offset by $108 million in writedowns on $3.8 billion of ARS repurchased from clients and held on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition and losses associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans. In fiscal 2007, principal transaction trading revenues increased 23%, primarily due to higher revenues from derivative products, municipal and corporate fixed income securities, and foreign exchange products and higher revenues associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans. Principal Transactions Investments. Principal transaction net investment losses were $54 million in fiscal 2008 compared with net investment gains of $29 million and $57 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. The results in fiscal 2008 reflected net losses associated with investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation plans. The results in fiscal 2007 reflected lower net gains from certain of the Companys investments in exchanges and memberships compared with fiscal 2006. Commissions. Commission revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commission revenues decreased 2% in fiscal 2008, reflecting lower client activity. Commission revenues increased 23% in fiscal 2007, reflecting higher client activity. 55 Table of Contents Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues from individual investors electing a fee based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management, account services and administration. The Company also receives shareholder servicing fees and fees for services it provides in distributing certain open ended mutual funds and other products. Mutual fund distribution fees are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision. Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 11% in fiscal 2008 compared with an 11% increase in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, the decrease was driven by a change in the classification of sub advisory fees due to modifications of certain customer agreements, the discontinuance of the Companys fee based brokerage program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and asset depreciation. In fiscal 2007, the increase was primarily due to higher client asset balances in fee based accounts. Client assets in fee based accounts decreased 32% to $136 billion as of November 30, 2008 and represented 25% of total client assets versus 27% at November 30, 2007. Client assets in fee based accounts rose 3% to $201 billion at November 30, 2007 and represented 27% of total client assets versus 29% at November 30, 2006. Total client asset balances decreased to $546 billion as of November 30, 2008 from $758 billion as of November 30, 2007, primarily due to asset depreciation. Client asset balances in households greater than $1 million decreased to $349 billion as of November 30, 2008 from $522 billion at November 30, 2007 and $442 billion at November 30, 2006. Net Interest. Interest and dividend revenues and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including customer bank deposits and margin loans and securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions. Net interest revenues increased 32% and 46% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to increased customer account balances in the bank deposit program. Balances in the bank deposit program rose to $36.4 billion as of November 30, 2008 from $26.2 billion at November 30, 2007. Other. Other revenues primarily include customer account service fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues were $965 million and $163 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Fiscal 2008 included $743 million related to the sale of MSWM S.V., the Spanish onshore mass affluent wealth management business, during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) and Global Wealth Management Groups share ($43 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations Morgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion). Fiscal 2007 reflected higher service fees and higher other miscellaneous revenues. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 7% in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting the charge of $532 million for the ARS repurchase program (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Compensation and benefits expense remained flat in fiscal 2008, as severance related expenses of $41 million and investment in the business were offset by lower incentive based compensation accruals. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 25%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in space costs and branch renovations. Professional services expense decreased 40%, primarily due to the change in the classification of sub advisory fees due to modifications of certain customer agreements and lower legal costs. Other expenses increased 206%, primarily resulting from the charge of $532 million related to ARS as previously mentioned and higher litigation costs. 56 Table of Contents Non interest expenses increased 9% in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by lower non compensation expenses, primarily due to lower charges for legal and regulatory matters and continued cost discipline across the business. Compensation and benefits expense increased 15%, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation accruals due to higher net revenues and investments in the business, partially offset by Global Wealth Management Groups share ($50 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement eligible employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses decreased 2%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 6%, primarily due to leasehold improvements and higher rental costs. Information processing and communications expense decreased 8%, primarily due to lower computing costs. Marketing and business development expense increased 39%, primarily due to costs associated with the Companys advertising campaign. Other expenses decreased 20%, primarily resulting from a reduction in costs associated with legal and regulatory matters, which included an insurance reimbursement related to a litigation matter. 57 Table of Contents ASSET MANAGEMENT INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION Fiscal2008 Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 61 $ 264 $ 138 Principal transactions: Trading (346 ) (129 ) Investments (1,661 ) 1,774 669 Commissions 14 23 25 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 2,960 3,524 2,574 Other 463 75 26 Total non interest revenues 1,491 5,531 3,432 Interest and dividends 170 74 48 Interest expense 369 112 27 Net interest (199 ) (38 ) 21 Net revenues 1,292 5,493 3,453 Total non interest expenses 3,099 4,026 2,602 (Loss) income before income taxes (1,807 ) 1,467 851 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (690 ) 541 340 Net income (loss) $ (1,117 ) $ 926 $ 511 Investment Banking. Asset Management generates investment banking revenues primarily from the placement of investments in real estate funds and the underwriting of unit trust products. Investment banking revenues decreased 77% in fiscal 2008 and increased 91% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in fiscal 2008 primarily reflected lower revenues from real estate products. The increase in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher revenues from certain real estate products. Principal Transactions Trading. In fiscal 2008, the Company recognized losses of $346 million, which included $470 million related to securities issued by SIVs included in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. These losses were partially offset by net gains from hedges on certain investments. In fiscal 2007, the Company recognized losses of $129 million related to SIVs. SIVs are unconsolidated entities that issue various capital notes and debt instruments to fund the purchase of assets. While the Company does not sponsor or serve as asset manager to any unconsolidated SIVs, the Company does serve as investment advisor to certain unconsolidated money market funds (Funds) that have investments in securities issued by SIVs. In the second half of fiscal 2007, widespread illiquidity in the commercial paper market led to market value declines and rating agency downgrades of many securities issued by SIVs, some of which were held by the Funds. As a result, the Company purchased at amortized cost approximately $900 million of such securities from the Funds during fiscal 2007 and $217 million of such securities during fiscal 2008. The carrying value of the purchased securities still held by the Company as of November 30, 2008 was $209 million. Such positions are reflected at fair value and are presented in Financial instruments owned Corporate and other debt in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Funds had investments in securities issued by SIVs of an aggregate face value of approximately $100 million as of November 30, 2008 compared with $8.2 billion as of November 30, 2007. Subsequent to November 30, 2008, the Company has not purchased additional SIV securities from the Funds and the Funds no longer have investments in such securities. The Company has no obligation to purchase any additional securities from the Funds in the future. 58 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, money market and liquidity funds advised by the Companys asset management affiliates that invest primarily in corporate obligations experienced net outflows of $18 billion. Credit and liquidity conditions deteriorated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, resulting in material redemptions from corporate money market and liquidity funds. The Company purchased approximately $25 billion of securities from the funds during fiscal 2008. Most of the securities have matured or were sold by the Company. At November 30, 2008, $600 million were included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. The securities were purchased by the Company to fund investor redemptions amid illiquid trading markets for a wide range of money market instruments. Securities purchased included commercial paper, municipals, certificates of deposit and notes. All of the securities were short term in nature and were rated A1/P1 or better. These purchases were funded primarily through various available stabilization facilities. The Company does not consolidate these money market and liquidity funds because the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in the funds nor is it the primary beneficiary of such funds. The Company also does not have a significant variable interest in such funds. Principal Transactions Investments. Asset Management principal transaction investment revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on the Companys investments. Principal transaction net investment losses aggregating $1,661 million were recognized in fiscal 2008 as compared with gains of $1,774 million in fiscal 2007. The results in fiscal 2008 were primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys merchant banking business, including real estate and private equity investments, and losses associated with certain investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. Included in the net investment losses in fiscal 2008 were writedowns of approximately $250 million on Crescent prior to its consolidation. See Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions Real Estate Investor Funds herein for further discussion. The results in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by investments associated with the Companys real estate products and private equity portfolio, including employee deferred compensation plans and co investment plans. Real estate and private equity investments generally are held for long term appreciation. It is not possible to determine when the Company will realize the value of such investments since, among other factors, such investments generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Moreover, estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset Management, distribution and administration fees include revenues generated from the management and supervision of assets, performance based fees relating to certain funds, and separately managed accounts and fees relating to the distribution of certain open ended mutual funds. Asset Management fees arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance based fees are earned on certain funds as a percentage of appreciation earned by those funds and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis. Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 16% in fiscal 2008 compared with an increase of 37% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower performance fees from alternative investment products, lower distribution fees, and lower fund management and administration fees, reflecting a decrease in average assets under management. Fiscal 2008 also reflected lower shareholder servicing fees related to the modification of certain sub transfer agent agreements, which resulted in an offsetting reduction to professional services expense. The increase in fiscal 2007 was due to higher fund management and administration fees resulting from an increase in assets under management and a more favorable asset mix. The increase was also due to higher performance fees from the alternatives business. 59 Table of Contents Asset Managements year end and average assets under management or supervision were as follows: At November 30, Average for 2008 2007(1) 2006(1) Fiscal2008 Fiscal2007(1) Fiscal2006(1) (dollars in billions) Assets under management or supervision by distribution channel: Morgan Stanley Retail and Intermediary $ 46 $ 81 $ 74 $ 70 $ 79 $ 71 Van Kampen Retail and Intermediary 84 150 142 127 149 133 Retail money markets 30 31 35 33 33 39 Total Americas Retail 160 262 251 230 261 243 U.S. Institutional 90 128 100 118 116 98 Institutional money markets 52 68 49 74 57 38 Non U.S. 91 132 92 120 111 81 Total assets under management or supervision 393 590 492 542 545 460 Share of minority interest assets(2) 6 7 4 7 6 1 Total $ 399 $ 597 $ 496 $ 549 $ 551 $ 461 Assets under management or supervision by asset class: Equity $ 135 $ 265 $ 240 $ 215 $ 256 $ 230 Fixed income 159 201 177 204 187 167 Alternatives(3) 48 67 41 67 58 34 Unit trust 9 15 14 13 15 13 Total core asset management 351 548 472 499 516 444 Private equity 4 4 2 3 2 2 Infrastructure 4 2 3 1 Real estate 34 36 18 37 26 14 Total merchant banking 42 42 20 43 29 16 Total assets under management or supervision 393 590 492 542 545 460 Share of minority interest assets(2) 6 7 4 7 6 1 Total $ 399 $ 597 $ 496 $ 549 $ 551 $ 461 (1) Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.

Other revenues increased 517% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the revenues associated with Crescent. See Real Estate Related Positions Real Estate Investor Funds Crescent herein for further discussion. The increase in fiscal 2008 also included Asset Managements share ($74 million) of the Companys repurchase of debt (see Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations Morgan Stanley Debt herein for further discussion) and higher revenues associated with Lansdowne Partners (Lansdowne), a London based investment manager in which the Company has a minority interest. Other revenues increased 188% in fiscal 2007, primarily due to revenues associated with Lansdowne and Avenue Capital Group, a New York based investment manager, which the Company acquired minority stakes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Non Interest Expenses. Non interest expenses decreased 23% in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting a decrease in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by higher operating costs and an impairment charge of $243 million associated with Crescent. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 53% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs reflecting lower net revenues and losses associated with principal investments for the benefit of the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. The decrease in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by severance related expenses of $97 million. Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 27%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 16%, primarily due to higher costs related to increased occupancy usage compared with fiscal 2007. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees decreased 9%, primarily due to lower commission expenses. Professional services expense decreased 20%, primarily due to lower sub advisory fees and sub transfer agent fees, partially offset by an increase in consulting and legal fees. Other expenses increased 412%, primarily due to Crescent operating costs and impairment charges of $268 million, including the $243 million noted above. 61 Table of Contents Non interest expenses increased 55% in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting an increase in compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased 81% in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting higher incentive based compensation accruals due to higher net revenues. The increase in fiscal 2007 was also due to expenses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, partially offset by Asset Managements share ($20 million) of the incremental compensation expense related to equity awards to retirement eligible employees that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding compensation and benefits expense, non interest expenses increased 24%. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 29%, primarily due to higher rental costs associated with business growth. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased 10%, primarily due to increased fee sharing, increased assets under management and higher commission expenses associated with the launching of new products. These increases were offset by a decrease in the deferred commission amortization. Information processing and communications expense increased 21%, primarily due to higher licensing fees associated with the acquisition of FrontPoint Partners (FrontPoint). Professional services expense increased 47%, primarily due to higher sub advisory fees related to the acquisition of FrontPoint. Other expenses increased 47%, primarily due to an insurance reimbursement received in fiscal 2006 related to certain legal matters and an increase in other miscellaneous expenses. 62 Table of Contents Other Matters.

Overview. The Company has real estate exposure(1) to: non subprime residential mortgages, a category which includes prime, Alt A, European and Asian residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage backed securities bonds (RMBS) and derivatives referencing such mortgages or mortgage backed securities; commercial whole loans, commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and related derivatives; 63 Table of Contents U.S. subprime mortgage related trading positions consisting of U.S. asset backed securities (ABS), collateralized debt obligation (CDO) securities, investments in subprime loans and derivatives referencing subprime mortgages or subprime mortgage backed securities; and real estate properties and real estate investor funds. (1) Subprime mortgages are loans secured by real property made to a borrower (or borrowers) with a diminished or impaired credit rating or with a limited credit history. A borrowers credit history is reflected in his credit report and routinely converted into a numerical credit score often referred to as a Fair Isaac Corporation (or FICO) score. Generally, a loan made to a borrower with a low FICO score or other credit score has historically been considered subprime. Loans to borrowers with higher FICO scores are typically considered prime or A1t A, but may be subprime if the loan exhibits other high risk factors. The Company exposures include interests in and derivatives with CDOs. CDOs provide credit risk exposure to a portfolio of securities (cash CDOs) or a reference portfolio of securities (synthetic CDOs). The underlying or reference portfolios may consist of ABS, RMBS, CMBS or other securities. The CDOs to which the Company has exposure were primarily structured and underwritten by third parties, although the Company also structured and underwrote CDOs for which it received structuring and or distribution fees, and from time to time retained interests in such CDOs. The Companys interests in mortgage related positions are carried at fair value with changes recognized in earnings. The valuation methodology used for these instruments incorporates a variety of inputs, including prices observed from the execution of a limited number of trades in the marketplace; ABX, CMBX and similar indices that track the performance of a series of credit default swaps based on subprime residential or commercial mortgages; and other market information, including data on remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on the underlying mortgages. The fair value of such positions experienced significant declines in the second half of fiscal 2007 and throughout fiscal 2008 as a result of a deterioration of value in the benchmark instruments as well as market developments. The value of these positions remains subject to mark to market volatility. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description regarding valuation of these instruments. The Companys non subprime residential, commercial and U.S. subprime mortgage related exposures have each been reduced in fiscal 2008 through writedowns, sales, paydowns, and hedging and trading activities, whereby the Company purchased protection including credit default, index and total rate of return swap positions. The Company continues to monitor its real estate related and lending related positions in order to manage its exposures to these markets and businesses. As market conditions continue to evolve, the fair value of these positions could further deteriorate. The following tables provide a summary of the Companys non subprime residential, commercial and U.S. subprime mortgage related exposures (excluding amounts related to mortgage related securities portfolios in the Companys Subsidiary Banks) as of and for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, as well as the Companys Net Exposure. The Company utilizes various methods of evaluating risk in its trading and other portfolios, including monitoring its Net Exposure. Net Exposure is defined as potential loss to the Company over a period of time in an event of 100% default of the referenced loan, assuming zero recovery. Positive net exposure amounts indicate potential loss (long position) in a default scenario. Negative net exposure amounts indicate potential gain (short position) in a default scenario. Net Exposure does not take into consideration the risk of counterparty default such that actual losses could exceed the amount of Net Exposure. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein for a further description of how credit risk is monitored. For a further discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. 64 Table of Contents Non subprime Residential Mortgage Related Exposures.

As of November 30, 2008, the $9.3 billion is reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition as follows: Financial instruments owned of $13.9 billion and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased of $4.6 billion. As of November 30, 2007, the $6.1 billion is reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition as follows: Financial instruments owned of $15.3 billion and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased of $9.2 billion. (2) CDO squared refers to CDOs where the collateral is comprised entirely of other CDO securities. (3) In determining the fair value of the Companys ABS super senior CDO related exposures the Company took into consideration prices observed from the execution of a limited number of transactions and data for relevant benchmark instruments in synthetic subprime markets. Deterioration of value in the benchmark instruments as well as market developments have led to significant declines in the estimates of fair value. These declines reflected increased implied losses across this portfolio. At November 30, 2008, these implied loss levels are consistent with losses in the range between 22% 48% implied by the ABX indices. These cumulative loss levels, at a severity rate of 62%, imply defaults in the range of 79% 95% for 2005 and 2006 outstanding mortgages. 66 Table of Contents Subsidiary Banks. The securities portfolios of the Subsidiary Banks include certain subprime related securities. The portfolios contain no subprime whole loans, subprime residuals or CDOs. At November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, the securities portfolios totaled $7.2 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively, consisting primarily of investment grade rated ABS bonds and residential mortgage backed securities. Of these total amounts, $2.7 billion and $5.5 billion were subprime mortgage related securities as of November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, respectively. Real Estate Investments. Real Estate Investor Funds. The Company acts as the general partner for various real estate funds and also invests in certain of these funds as a limited partner. Crescent. An affiliated entity of the Company acquired an investment in Crescent in August 2007. The assets of Crescent primarily include office buildings, investments in resorts and residential developments in select markets across the U.S. (the Crescent properties). The Company had originally intended to include the Crescent properties in an investor fund but at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company modified its investment strategy based on various factors, including current market conditions, valuation, size of the investment and timing of the fund, and determined to operate Crescent and risk manage the Crescent properties. As a result, the Company consolidated Crescents assets and liabilities of approximately $4.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, as of May 31, 2008. The Company will continue to evaluate the Crescent properties and position them for sale as opportunities arise. Prior to consolidating the assets and liabilities of Crescent, the Company recorded writedowns on its investment of approximately $250 million. These writedowns are included in the Asset Management business segment and are reflected in Principal transactions investments in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $243 million, which is reflected in Other expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the consolidated operating results of Crescent are included in the Asset Management business segment. Fiscal 2008 included net revenues of $37 million, non interest expenses of $568 million and a loss before income taxes of $531 million related to Crescent. Real Estate Investments. The Companys real estate investments are shown below by business group, property type and geographic region. Such amounts exclude investments that benefit certain employee deferred compensation and co investment plans.

The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). For further information on SFAS No. 123R, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, based on interpretive guidance related to SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company changed its accounting policy for expensing the cost of anticipated year end equity awards that are granted to retirement eligible employees in the first quarter of the following year. Effective December 1, 2005, the Company accrues the estimated cost of these awards over the course of the current fiscal year. As such, the Company accrued the estimated cost of fiscal 2008 year end awards granted to retirement eligible employees over the 2008 fiscal year rather than expensing the awards on the date of grant (which occurred in December 2008). As a result, fiscal 2006 stock based compensation expense primarily included the following costs: amortization of fiscal 2003 year end awards; amortization of fiscal 2004 year end awards; amortization of fiscal 2005 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; the full cost of fiscal 2005 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2005); and the full cost of fiscal 2006 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2006). Fiscal 2007 stock based compensation expense primarily included the following costs: amortization of fiscal 2004 year end awards; amortization of fiscal 2005 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; amortization of fiscal 2006 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; and the full cost of fiscal 2007 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2007). 68 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 stock based compensation expense primarily included the following costs: amortization of fiscal 2005 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; amortization of fiscal 2006 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; amortization of fiscal 2007 year end awards to non retirement eligible employees; and the full cost of fiscal 2008 year end awards to retirement eligible employees (made in December 2008). Fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 year end awards are generally amortized over three and four years, while subsequent year end awards are generally amortized over two and three years. Coleman Litigation. Effective November 30, 2007, the Company reversed a $360 million reserve previously established under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5) for a claim filed against the Company by Coleman. Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. Contributions. The Company made contributions of $326 million and $131 million to its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations. The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions to its funded plans by considering several factors, including the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. The Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations (for example, in the U.S., the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA). As of November 30, 2008, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the Companys U.S. pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Liabilities for benefits payable under certain postretirement and unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries. Expense. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of an employees pension benefits (including prior service cost) over the employees estimated service period. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), the measurement date to determine plan assets, liabilities and expense was changed from September 30 to November 30. Net periodic pension expense was $134 million, $145 million and $160 million, while net periodic postretirement expense was $17 million, $14 million and $18 million for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. See Notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans including the adoption of SFAS No. 158. 69 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Fair Value. Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value. A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company makes estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include but are not limited to: Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased; Securities received as collateral and Obligation to return securities received as collateral; Certain Commercial paper and other short term borrowings, primarily structured notes; Certain Deposits; Other secured financings; and Certain Long term borrowings, primarily structured notes and certain junior subordinated debentures. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 uses observable prices in active markets, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market dislocation, such as those experienced in fiscal 2008, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a continued downturn in market conditions could lead to further declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 hierarchy, and related valuation techniques, see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The Companys Level 3 assets before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $86.2 billion and $73.7 billion as of November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, respectively, and represented approximately 27% as of November 30, 2008 and 15% as of November 30, 2007 of the assets measured at fair value (13% and 7% of total assets as of November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, respectively). Level 3 liabilities before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $28.4 billion and $19.5 billion as of November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, respectively, and represented approximately 16% and 7%, respectively, of the Companys liabilities measured at fair value. During fiscal 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $17.3 billion of certain Corporate and other debt from Level 2 to Level 3. The reclassifications were primarily related to residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, commercial whole loans and corporate loans. The reclassifications were due to a reduction in the volume of recently executed transactions and market price quotations for these instruments, or a lack of available broker quotes, such that unobservable inputs had to be utilized for the fair value measurement of these instruments. These unobservable inputs include, depending upon the position, assumptions to establish 70 Table of Contents comparability to bonds, loans or swaps with observable price/spread levels, default recovery rates, forecasted credit losses and prepayment rates. The Company reclassified approximately $7.5 billion of certain Corporate and other debt from Level 3 to Level 2. These reclassifications primarily related to ABS and corporate loans as some liquidity re entered the market for these specific positions, and external prices and spread inputs for these instruments became observable. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non Recurring Basis. Certain of the Companys assets were measured at fair value on a non recurring basis. These assets include certain goodwill, certain intangible assets, certain premises and equipment, certain equity method investments, certain loans and certain real estate investments that were impaired during fiscal 2008, primarily in the fourth quarter, and written down to their fair value. In addition, a continued downturn in market conditions could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs, by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items. For further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis, see Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Control Processes. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. Additionally, groups independent from the trading divisions within the Financial Control, Market Risk and Credit Risk Departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more information regarding the Companys risk management practices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress. 71 Table of Contents The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case by case basis and represent an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. The Company is subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The Company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded reserves, if any. See Notes 9 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings and tax examinations. Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities. The Companys involvement with special purpose entities (SPEs) consists primarily of the following: Transferring financial assets into SPEs; Acting as an underwriter of beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles; Holding one or more classes of securities issued by, or making loans to or investments in SPEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets; Purchasing and selling (in both a market making and a proprietary trading capacity) securities issued by SPEs/VIEs, whether such vehicles are sponsored by the Company or not; Entering into derivative transactions with SPEs (whether or not sponsored by the Company); Providing warehouse financing to CDOs and CLOs; Entering into derivative agreements with non SPEs whose value is derived from securities issued by SPEs; 72 Table of Contents Servicing assets held by SPEs or holding servicing rights related to assets held by SPEs that are serviced by others under subservicing arrangements; Serving as an asset manager to various investment funds that may invest in securities that are backed, in whole or in part, by SPEs; and Structuring and or investing in other structured transactions designed to provide enhanced, tax efficient yields to the Company or its clients. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial instruments. The Companys involvement with SPEs is discussed further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, these SPEs are deemed for accounting purposes to be variable interest entities (VIEs). Unless a VIE is determined to be a QSPE (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company is required to perform an analysis of each VIE at the date upon which the Company becomes involved with it to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case the Company must consolidate the VIE. QSPEs are not consolidated. In addition, the Company serves as an investment advisor to numerous unconsolidated money market and other funds. The Company reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. If the Companys initial assessment results in a determination that it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, then the Company reassesses this determination upon the occurrence of: Changes to the VIEs governing documents or contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocates the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the VIE between the current primary beneficiary and the other variable interest holders, including the Company. Acquisition by the Company of additional variable interests in the VIE. If the Companys initial assessment results in a determination that it is the primary beneficiary, then the Company reassesses this determination upon the occurrence of: Changes to the VIEs governing documents or contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocates the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the VIE between the current primary beneficiary and the other variable interest holders, including the Company. A sale or disposition by the Company of all or part of its variable interests in the VIE to parties unrelated to the Company. The issuance of new variable interests by the VIE to parties unrelated to the Company. The determination of whether an SPE meets the accounting requirements of a QSPE requires significant judgment, particularly in evaluating whether the permitted activities of the SPE are significantly limited and in determining whether derivatives held by the SPE are passive and nonexcessive. In addition, the analysis involved in determining whether an entity is a VIE, and in determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires significant judgment (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements). 73 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Companys senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. The Companys Treasury Department and other control groups, assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated statements of financial condition, liquidity and capital structure. Global market and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, volatility reached unprecedented levels. In particular, the Companys cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the Company became a financial holding company under the BHC Act and gained additional access to various government lending programs and facilities including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) (for a further discussion about these lending programs and facilities, see Funding Management Policies Secured Financing herein). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company further diversified its funding profile and increased its liquidity position by accessing these programs and engaging in a reduction of balance sheet intensive businesses within the Institutional Securities business segment. The Balance Sheet. The Company actively monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in managing the size of its balance sheet. The Companys total assets decreased to $658,812 million at November 30, 2008, from $1,045,409 million at November 30, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in securities borrowed, financial instruments owned corporate and other debt and corporate equities, securities received as collateral, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and receivables from customers, partially offset by increases in interest bearing deposits with banks. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company increased its focus on rescaling the size of its balance sheet intensive businesses including prime brokerage and select proprietary trading strategies. Within the sales and trading related assets and liabilities are transactions attributable to securities financing activities. As of November 30, 2008, securities financing assets and liabilities were $251 billion and $238 billion, respectively. Securities financing transactions include repurchase and resale agreements, securities borrowed and loaned transactions, securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received, customer receivables/payables and related segregated customer cash. Securities financing assets and liabilities also include matched book transactions with minimal market, credit and or liquidity risk. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer owned securities, and customer cash, which is segregated, according to regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer payables to the Companys prime brokerage clients. The Companys risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit the Companys credit exposure to customers. Included within securities financing assets was $5 billion recorded under certain provisions of SFAS No. 140 which represented equal and offsetting assets and liabilities for fully collateralized non cash loan transactions. 74 Table of Contents The Company uses the balance sheet leverage ratio, the Tier 1 leverage ratio and risk based capital ratios (see Regulatory Requirements herein) as indicators of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of the Companys overall liquidity and capital policies. The Company utilizes the leverage ratio when evaluating leverage trends. The balance sheet leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets (as the Company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs). In addition, the Company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities including their long dated nature, the Companys ability to defer coupon interest, and the subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure. The Company also receives rating agency equity credit for these securities. The following table sets forth the Companys total assets and leverage ratios as of November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007 and for the average month end balances during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007: Balance at Average Month End Balance November 30,2008 November 30,2007 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 (dollars in millions, except ratio data) Total assets $ 658,812 $ 1,045,409 $ 1,006,608 $ 1,202,065 Common equity $ 31,676 $ 30,169 $ 33,590 $ 35,235 Preferred equity 19,155 1,100 3,878 1,100 Shareholders equity 50,831 31,269 37,468 36,335 Junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts 10,266 4,876 9,963 4,878 Subtotal 61,097 36,145 47,431 41,213 Less: Goodwill and net intangible assets (3,138 ) (4,071 ) (3,914 ) (3,924 ) Tangible shareholders equity $ 57,959 $ 32,074 $ 43,517 $ 37,289 Leverage ratio(1) 11.4x 32.6x 23.1x 32.2x (1) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders equity.

In connection with the note issuances, the Company generally enters into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short term London Interbank Offered Rates trading levels. The weighted average maturity of the Companys long term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 6.4 years at November 30, 2008 and 5.5 years at November 30, 2007. 75 Table of Contents As of November 30, 2008, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Companys senior indebtedness was approximately $156 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries) compared with $207 billion as of November 30, 2007. The decrease in the amount of senior indebtedness was primarily due to maturities and repurchases of senior debt as well as currency revaluations. China Investment Corporation Investment. In December 2007, the Company sold Equity Units that included contracts to purchase Company common stock to a wholly owned subsidiary of CIC for approximately $5,579 million. CICs ownership in the Companys common stock, including the number of shares of common stock to be received by CIC upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts, will be 9.9% or less of the Companys total shares outstanding based on the total shares that were outstanding on November 30, 2007. CIC is a passive financial investor and has no special rights of ownership nor a role in the management of the Company. A substantial portion of the investment proceeds was treated as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes. For a more detailed summary of the Equity Units, including the junior subordinated debentures issued to support trust common and trust preferred securities and the stock purchase contracts, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. On October 13, 2008, the Company issued to MUFG 7,839,209 shares of Series B Non Cumulative Non Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) and 1,160,791 shares of Series C Non Cumulative Non Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series C Preferred Stock) for an aggregate purchase price of $9 billion that gave MUFG a 21% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis at the date of issuance (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes. Capital Purchase Program. The Company was part of the initial group of financial institutions participating in the CPP, and on October 26, 2008 entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement Standard Terms with the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which, among other things, the Company sold to the U.S. Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $10 billion, 10 million shares of Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series D Preferred Stock) and warrants to purchase up to 65,245,759 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $22.99 per share (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Series D Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and ranks senior to the Companys common shares and pari passu, which is at an equal level in the capital structure, with existing preferred shares, other than preferred shares which by their terms rank junior to any other existing preferred shares. The Series D Preferred Stock pays a compounding cumulative dividend rate of 5% per annum for the first five years and will reset to a rate of 9% per annum after year five. The Series D Preferred Stock is non voting, other than class voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the Series D Preferred Stock. The Series D Preferred Stock is callable at par after three years. Prior to the end of three years, the Series D Preferred Stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock of at least $250 million. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the Series D Preferred Stock to a third party at any time. The number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the warrant will be reduced by 50% if the Company receives aggregate gross proceeds of at least 100% of the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Series D Preferred Stock ($10 billion) from one or more qualified equity offerings prior to December 31, 2009. Equity Capital Management Policies. The Companys senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. The Company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory 76 Table of Contents requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total equity, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity. As of November 30, 2008, the Companys equity capital (which includes shareholders equity and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts) was $61,097 million, an increase of $24,952 million from November 30, 2007, primarily due to the CIC, MUFG and CPP investments and growth in retained earnings. In December 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $6 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock. This share repurchase authorization replaced the Companys previous repurchase authorizations with one repurchase program for capital management purposes that will consider, among other things, business segment capital needs as well as equity based compensation and benefit plan requirements. As of November 30, 2008, the Company had approximately $1.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $711 million of its common stock as part of its capital management share repurchase program (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in Part II, Item 5). As a condition under the CPP, the Companys share repurchases are currently limited to purchases in connection with the administration of any employee benefit plan, consistent with past practices, including purchases to offset share dilution in connection with any such plans. This restriction is effective until October 2011 or until the U.S. Treasury no longer owns any of the Companys preferred shares issued under the CPP. The Board of Directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In December 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.27. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $348.35 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.34835); a quarterly dividend of $25.56 per share of perpetual Fixed Rate Non Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B; a quarterly dividend of $25.56 per share of perpetual Fixed Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C; and a quarterly dividend of $10.69 per share of perpetual Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D. As part of its participation in the CPP, the Company agreed that it would not, without the U.S. Treasurys consent, increase the current dividend on its common stock as long as any preferred stock issued under the CPP remains outstanding until the third anniversary of the investment or until the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock it purchased under the CPP to third parties. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the CPP investment, the Company is prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of common stock, other junior securities or preferred stock ranking pari passu with the Series D Preferred Stock or repurchasing or redeeming any shares of the Companys common shares, other junior securities or preferred stock ranking pari passu with the Series D Preferred Stock in any quarter unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on the Series D Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods (including the latest completed dividend period), subject to certain limited exceptions. Economic Capital. The Companys economic capital framework estimates the amount of equity capital required to support the businesses over a wide range of market environments while simultaneously satisfying regulatory, rating agency and investor requirements. The framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment and sub allocated to product lines. Each business segment is capitalized as if it were an independent operating entity. This process is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk adjusted basis (such as return on equity and shareholder value added). 77 Table of Contents Economic capital is based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses. The Company assesses stress loss capital across various dimensions of market, credit, business and operational risks. Economic capital requirements are met by regulatory Tier 1 capital. For a further discussion of the Companys Tier 1 capital see Regulatory Requirements herein. The difference between the Companys Tier 1 capital and aggregate economic capital requirements denotes the Companys unallocated capital position. The following table presents the Companys allocated average Tier 1 capital (economic capital) and average common equity for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 AverageTier 1capital Averagecommonequity AverageTier 1capital Averagecommonequity (dollars in billions) Institutional Securities $ 25.9 $ 23.3 $ 24.6 $ 23.9 Global Wealth Management Group 1.7 1.5 1.5 1.7 Asset Management 3.7 3.9 2.7 3.5 Unallocated capital 6.6 4.9 2.9 2.9 Total from continuing operations 37.9 33.6 31.7 32.0 Discontinued operations 2.7 3.2 Total $ 37.9 $ 33.6 $ 34.4 $ 35.2 Tier 1 capital allocated to the Institutional Securities business segment increased compared with fiscal 2007 driven by growth in credit risk exposure partially offset by the incorporation of market risk capital model enhancements. Tier 1 capital and common equity allocated to Asset Management increased primarily due to consolidation of Crescent on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. See Other Matters Real Estate Related Positions Real Estate Investments Crescent herein for further discussion. Additionally, the proportion of common equity allocated to the operating segments decreased due to the issuance of hybrid capital. See China Investment Corporation Investment, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Capital Purchase Program herein. The Company generally uses available unallocated capital for organic growth, additional acquisitions and other capital needs, including repurchases of common stock where permitted under the terms of the CPP while maintaining adequate capital ratios. For a discussion of risk based capital ratios, see Regulatory Requirements herein. Liquidity and Funding Management Policies. The primary goal of the Companys liquidity management and funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market environments. Given the mix of the Companys business activities, funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of secured and unsecured financing. The Companys liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the Company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations without material franchise or business impact. The key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the Companys business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of stressed market conditions. Liquidity Management Policies. The principal elements of the Companys liquidity management framework are the Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) and Liquidity Reserves. Comprehensive financing guidelines (secured funding, long term funding strategy, surplus capacity, diversification and staggered maturities) support the Companys target liquidity profile. 78 Table of Contents Contingency Funding Plan. The Contingency Funding Plan is the Companys primary liquidity risk management tool. The CFP models a potential, prolonged liquidity contraction over a one year time period and sets forth a course of action to effectively manage a liquidity event. The CFP and liquidity risk exposures are evaluated on an on going basis and reported to the Firm Risk Committee and other appropriate risk committees. The Companys CFP model is designed to be dynamic and scenarios incorporate a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance; (ii) maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral; (iii) return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities; (iv) additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a two notch long term credit ratings downgrade; (v) higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding, similar to a stressed cash capital approach; (vi) client cash withdrawals; (vii) drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; and (viii) discretionary unsecured debt buybacks. The CFP is produced on a parent and major subsidiary level to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability at various legal entities. The CFP assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be held at certain subsidiaries due to regulatory, legal or tax constraints. In addition, the CFP assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities. Liquidity Reserves. The Company seeks to maintain target liquidity reserves that are sized to cover daily funding needs and meet strategic liquidity targets as outlined in the CFP. These liquidity reserves are held in the form of cash deposits with banks and pools of unencumbered securities. The parent company liquidity reserve is managed globally and consists of overnight cash deposits and unencumbered U.S. and European government bonds and other high quality collateral. All of the parent securities are central bank eligible. The Company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserves (cash and securities) are maintained enhances its ability to quickly and efficiently source funding in a stressed environment. The Companys funding requirements and target liquidity reserves may vary based on changes to the level and composition of its balance sheet, timing of specific transactions, client financing activity, market conditions and seasonal factors. On November 30, 2008, the parent liquidity reserve was $61 billion and the total Company liquidity reserve was $130 billion. The average parent liquidity reserve was $69 billion and the average total Company liquidity reserve was $138 billion for fiscal 2008. Committed Credit Facilities. The Company maintains a $5 billion senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs, which consists of three separate tranches: a U.S. dollar tranche; a Japanese yen tranche; and a multicurrency tranche available in both euro and the British pound, all of which exist with the Company as borrower. At November 30, 2008, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement. The credit agreement expires on April 16, 2009 and the Company does not expect to renew this facility. Capital Covenants. In October 2006 and April 2007, the Company executed replacement capital covenants in connection with offerings by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII (the Capital Securities). Under the terms of the replacement capital covenants, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of certain specified holders of debt, to limitations on its ability to redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities for specified periods of time. For a complete description of the Capital Securities and the terms of the replacement capital covenants, see the Companys Current Reports on Form 8 K dated October 12, 2006 and April 26, 2007. 79 Table of Contents Funding Management Policies. The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period. The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include the Companys equity capital, long term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, commercial paper, letters of credit and lines of credit. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the U.S., European and Asian markets, targeting global investors and currencies such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with collateralized borrowings. The Companys goal is to achieve an optimal mix of secured and unsecured funding through appropriate use of collateralized borrowings. The Institutional Securities business segment emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding, which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. As part of this effort, the Institutional Securities business segment continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity. In addition, the Company, through several of its subsidiaries, maintains funded and unfunded committed credit facilities to support various businesses, including the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan, derivative contracts, warehouse lending, emerging market loan, structured product, corporate loan, investment banking and prime brokerage businesses. On March 11, 2008, the Fed announced an expansion of its securities lending program to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury securities and other collateral. Under the TSLF, the Fed will lend up to $200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days (rather than overnight, as in the existing program) by a pledge of other securities, including federal agency debt, federal agency residential mortgage backed securities (MBS), and non agency AAA/Aaa rated private label residential MBS. In September 2008, the Fed changed the TSLF from a monthly to a weekly competitive auction. On March 16, 2008, the Fed announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the New York Fed) has been granted the authority to establish a PDCF. The PDCF provides overnight funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of collateral. The Company may at times use the PDCF as an additional source of secured funding for its regular business operations. In September 2008, the New York Fed expanded the schedule of collateral acceptable under the PDCF. In September 2008, the Company became a financial holding company under the BHC Act (see Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company in Part I). Additionally, the Fed authorized the New York Fed to extend credit to the Companys U.S. broker dealer subsidiary against all types of collateral that may be pledged at the Feds Primary Credit Facility (PCF) for depository institutions or at the PDCF. The Fed also authorized the New York Fed to extend credit to the Companys London based broker dealer subsidiary against collateral that would be eligible to be pledged at the PDCF. Unsecured Financing. The Company views long term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding for core inventories and illiquid assets. Securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding, floating rate long term debt or fixed rate 80 Table of Contents long term debt swapped to a floating rate and deposits. The Company uses derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management, reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. In October 2008, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury invoked the systemic risk exception of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 and the FDIC announced the TLGP. The TLGP provides a guarantee, through the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, of certain senior unsecured debt issued by participating Eligible Entities (including the Company) between October 14, 2008 and June 30, 2009. The maximum amount of FDIC guaranteed debt a participating Eligible Entity (including the Company) may have outstanding is 125% of the entitys senior unsecured debt that was outstanding as of September 30, 2008 that was scheduled to mature on or before June 30, 2009. The ability of Eligible Entities (including the Company) to issue guaranteed debt under this program is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $16.2 billion of senior unsecured debt outstanding under the TLGP. Short Term Borrowings. The Companys unsecured short term borrowings may consist of commercial paper, bank loans, bank notes and structured notes with maturities of twelve months or less at issuance. The table below summarizes the Companys short term unsecured borrowings: AtNovember 30, 2008 AtNovember 30, 2007 (dollars in millions) Commercial paper $ 6,744 $ 22,596 Other short term borrowings 3,739 11,899 Total $ 10,483 $ 34,495 Commercial Paper Funding Facility. On October 7, 2008, the Fed announced the creation of the CPFF, a facility that complements the Feds existing credit facilities to help provide liquidity to term funding markets. The CPFF provides a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle that purchases three month unsecured and asset backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers. The CPFF is intended to improve liquidity in short term funding markets and thereby increase the availability of credit for businesses and households. The CPFF finances only highly rated, U.S. dollar denominated, three month commercial paper. On October 27, 2008, the CPFF began funding purchases of commercial paper. The Company has been participating in the CPFF program. Deposits. The Companys bank subsidiaries primary source of funding includes bank deposit sweeps, federal funds purchased, certificates of deposit, money market deposit accounts, commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Deposits were as follows: AtNovember 30, 2008 AtNovember 30, 2007 (dollars in millions) Savings and demand deposits $ 36,673 $ 27,186 Time deposits(1) 6,082 3,993 Total $ 42,755 $ 31,179 (1) Certain time deposit accounts are carried at fair value under the fair value option (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Deposits increased over the past year as consistent with the Companys ongoing strategy to enhance its stable funding profile. 81 Table of Contents On October 3, 2008, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the FDIC temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. This increased coverage lasts through December 31, 2009 and is in effect for Morgan Stanleys two U.S. depository institutions. Additionally, under the Final Rule implementing the TLGP, the FDIC provides unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2009, for certain transaction accounts at FDIC insured participating institutions. The Company has elected for its FDIC insured subsidiaries to participate in the account guarantee of the TLGP. Long Term Borrowings. The Company uses a variety of long term debt funding sources to generate liquidity, taking into consideration the results of the CFP. In addition, the issuance of long term debt allows the Company to reduce reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings). Financing transactions are structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients. Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. As a result of the significant disruptions in the credit markets, the cost of new financing available to the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 increased significantly. During fiscal 2008, the Companys long term financing strategy was driven, in part, by its continued focus on improving its balance sheet strength (evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions). As a result, for fiscal 2008, a principal amount of approximately $45 billion of unsecured debt was issued. The Company may from time to time engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt repurchases) which it believes are in the best interests of the Company and its investors. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $12.1 billion of fixed/floating rate long term debt. The Companys long term borrowings included the following components: AtNovember 30, 2008 AtNovember 30, 2007 (dollars in millions) Senior debt $ 148,959 $ 181,733 Subordinated debt 4,212 4,015 Junior subordinated debentures 10,266 4,876 Total $ 163,437 $ 190,624 Credit Ratings. The Company relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are dependent on the Companys short term and long term credit ratings. In addition, the Companys debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Factors that are important to the determination of the Companys credit ratings include the level and quality of earnings, capital adequacy, liquidity, risk appetite and management, asset quality and business mix. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, the Company may be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. As of November 30, 2008, the amount of additional collateral that could be called by counterparties under the terms of collateral agreements in the event of a one notch downgrade of the Companys long term credit rating was approximately $498.3 million. An additional amount of approximately $1,456.2 million could be called in the event of a two notch downgrade. Of these amounts, $1,013.2 million relates to bilateral arrangements between the Company and other parties where upon 82 Table of Contents the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the other. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the Company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded. As of January 28, 2009, the Companys and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.s senior unsecured ratings were as set forth below. The Company does not intend to disclose any future revisions to, or withdrawals of, these ratings, except in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Annual Reports on Form 10 K.

The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities business segment. Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets were approximately $1.2 billion at November 30, 2008, substantially all of which were related to residential mortgage loan, commercial mortgage loan and U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligation securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements as well as Critical Accounting Policies herein. The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Guarantees. FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45), requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. FIN 45 defines guarantees as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. FIN 45 also defines guarantees as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. 83 Table of Contents The table below summarizes certain information regarding derivative contracts, financial guarantees to third parties, market value guarantees and liquidity facilities at November 30, 2008: Maximum Potential Payout/Notional CarryingAmount(Asset)/Liability Collateral/Recourse Years to Maturity Type of Guarantee Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 Total (dollars in millions) Notional amount of derivative contracts(1) $ 985,276 $ 1,098,775 $ 1,915,444 $ 1,563,384 $ 5,562,879 $ 659,296 $ Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued(2) 1,102 1,813 1,977 4,445 9,337 98 4,794 Market value guarantees 658 658 35 144 Liquidity facilities 3,445 658 192 376 4,671 24 3,415 General partner guarantees 18 236 66 137 457 26 Auction rate security guarantees 2,572 2,572 193 (1) Fair value amounts of derivative contracts are shown on a gross basis prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company guarantees the debt and or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information on trust preferred securities, indemnities, exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees, general partner guarantees, securitized asset guarantees and other guarantees. Commitments and Contractual Obligations. The Companys commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees obtained to satisfy collateral requirements, investment activities, corporate lending and financing arrangements, mortgage lending and margin lending as of November 30, 2008 are summarized below by period of expiration. Since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: Years to Maturity Total atNovember 30,2008 Lessthan 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) Letters of credit and other financial guarantees obtained to satisfy collateral requirements $ 3,575 $ 2 $ $ $ 3,577 Investment activities 1,749 586 262 635 3,232 Primary lending commitments(1)(2) 9,506 10,161 20,966 1,793 42,426 Secondary lending commitments(1) 44 56 217 115 432 Commitments for secured lending transactions 1,302 938 1,662 17 3,919 Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements(3) 46,477 46,477 Commercial and residential mortgage related commitments(1) 2,822 2,822 Other commitments(4) 1,988 4 1 1,993 Total $ 67,463 $ 11,747 $ 23,108 $ 2,560 $ 104,878 (1) These commitments are recorded at fair value within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated statements of financial condition (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).

Purchase obligations at November 30, 2008 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements regarding subsequent events. Regulatory Requirements. In September 2008, the Company became a financial holding company subject to the regulation and oversight of the Fed. In granting financial holding company status, the Fed will evaluate the Companys compliance with well capitalized standards prospectively (see Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company in Part I). Prior to September 2008, the Company was a consolidated supervised entity as defined by the SEC. During fiscal 2008 and as of November 30, 2008, the Company calculated capital requirements on a consolidated basis in accordance with the Basel II Accord as interpreted by the SEC. The Basel II Accord is designed to be a risk based capital adequacy approach, which allows for the use of internal estimates of risk components to calculate regulatory capital. As of November 30, 2008, the Company was in compliance with Basel II capital requirements with a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets (RWAs) of 26.8%. The Company seeks to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to RWAs of at least 6%. This ratio as of November 30, 2008 was 17.9%. In addition to the above ratios, financial holding companies are also subject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the Fed. The Company calculated its Tier 1 leverage ratio as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets (which reflects adjustments for disallowed goodwill, certain intangible assets and deferred tax assets). The adjusted average total assets are derived using month end balances for the fiscal quarter. This ratio as of November 30, 2008 was 6.6%. 85 Table of Contents The following table presents the Companys Basel II consolidated capital ratios and allowances as of November 30 and August 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): November 30,2008 August 31,2008 Allowable Capital Tier 1 capital: Common shareholders equity $ 31,676 $ 34,665 Qualifying preferred stock 19,155 1,100 Qualifying mandatorily convertible trust preferred securities 5,579 5,579 Qualifying other junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts 4,788 4,788 Less: Goodwill (1,823 ) (2,536 ) Less: Non servicing intangible assets (675 ) (757 ) Less: Net deferred tax assets (4,747 ) (3,074 ) Less: Debt valuation adjustment (4,059 ) (2,201 ) Total Tier 1 capital 49,894 37,564 Tier 2 capital: Other components of allowable capital: Qualifying subordinated debt 4,102 4,092 Qualifying long term debt 20,845 14,690 Total Tier 2 capital 24,947 18,782 Total allowable capital $ 74,841 $ 56,346 Risk Weighted Assets Market risk $ 80,451 $ 100,521 Credit risk 151,954 144,966 Operational risk 46,375 51,100 Total $ 278,780 $ 296,587 Capital Ratios Total capital ratio 26.8 % 19.0 % Tier 1 capital ratio 17.9 % 12.7 % Total allowable capital is comprised of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists predominately of common shareholders equity as well as qualifying preferred stock (including cumulative preferred stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and non cumulative preferred stock), trust preferred securities mandatorily convertible to common equity and other junior subordinated debt issued to trusts less goodwill (excluding minority ownership), non servicing intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net deferred tax assets (recoverable in excess of one year) and debt valuation adjustment (DVA). DVA represents the cumulative change in fair value of certain of the Companys borrowings (for which the fair value option was elected) that was attributable to changes in instrument specific credit spreads and is included in retained earnings. For a further discussion of fair value see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Tier 2 capital consists of qualifying subordinated and long term debt. Long term debt included in Tier 2 capital has a maturity greater than five years and is limited (together with qualifying subordinated debt) to an amount equal to 50% of Tier 1 capital, until December 1, 2008 when long term debt no longer is included in Tier 2 capital. The Companys total capital ratio excluding long term debt from Tier 2 capital was 19.4% as of November 30, 2008. As of November 30, 2008, the Company calculated its RWAs in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements of the SEC which is consistent with guidelines described under the Basel II Accord. RWAs reflect both on and off balance sheet risk of the Company. The risk capital calculations will evolve over time as the Company enhances its risk management methodology and incorporates improvements in modeling techniques while maintaining compliance with the regulatory requirements and interpretations. For March 31, 2009 and future dates, the Company expects to calculate its capital ratios and RWAs in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for bank holding companies adopted by the Fed. These standards are based upon a framework described in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement, July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I. 86 Table of Contents Market RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and other factors. For a further discussion of the Companys market risks and Value at Risk model, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. Market RWAs incorporate three components: Systematic risk, Specific risk, and Incremental Default risk (IDR). Systematic and Specific risk charges are computed using either a Standardized Approach (applying a fixed percentage to the fair value of the assets) or the Companys Value at Risk model. Capital charges related to IDR are calculated using an IDR model that estimates the loss due to sudden default events affecting traded financial instruments at a 99.9% confidence level. In addition, Market RWAs include assets classified as investments for which capital is computed using a Standardized Approach. Credit RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its financial obligations. For a further discussion of the Companys credit risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein. Credit RWAs are determined using either an Internal Ratings based (IRB) Approach, which reflects the Companys internal estimate of a borrower or counterpartys credit worthiness, or a Standardized Approach. A Standardized Approach is used for certain asset categories, including receivables (e.g., fees, interest and other), premises, equipment and software costs, and other assets where a fixed percentage is applied to the fair value of the assets. Credit capital charges related to certain loans, OTC derivative receivable exposures and security financing transactions are computed using an IRB Approach. Within the IRB Approach, future potential credit exposure resulting from derivative receivables is estimated using an internal model and is the most significant contributor to total Credit RWAs. The risk reducing effect of hedges related to loan and counterparty exposures is excluded from capital calculations. Operational risk capital charges are designed to account for the risk of losses due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events and take into account legal risk. RWAs for operational risk are currently calculated under the Basic Indicator Approach in accordance with Basel II. The Company holds capital equal to the average net revenues over the previous three years using a fixed percentage. For a further discussion of operational risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Operational Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein. The Company also employs an Economic Capital framework, whereby incremental capital for stress losses is held in addition to capital requirements under Basel II requirements (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Economic Capital herein). Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. 87 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Risk Management. Risk Management Policy and Control Structure. Risk is an inherent part of the Companys business and activities. The Companys ability to properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability. The Companys portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole. The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in the Companys business activities: market, credit, liquidity and funding, operational and legal risk. Liquidity and funding risk is discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. The Companys currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The cornerstone of the Companys risk management philosophy is the execution of risk adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects the Companys capital base and franchise. The Companys risk management philosophy is based on the following principles: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. Given the importance of effective risk management to the Companys reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters. Risk management at the Company requires independent Company level oversight, accountability of the Companys business segments, constant communication, judgment, and knowledge of specialized products and markets. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segment level. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business, the Companys risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification. The nature of the Companys risks, coupled with this risk management philosophy, informs the Companys risk governance structure. The Companys risk governance structure includes the Firm Risk Committee, the Chief Risk Officer, the Internal Audit Department, independent control groups, and various other risk control managers, committees and groups located within and across business segments. The Firm Risk Committee, composed of the Companys most senior officers, oversees the Companys risk management structure. The Firm Risk Committees responsibilities include oversight of the Companys risk management principles, procedures and limits, and the monitoring of material market, credit, liquidity and funding, legal, operational and franchise risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The Firm Risk Committee is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee). The Chief Risk Officer, a member of the Firm Risk Committee who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of Company risk limits; reviews material market, credit and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department examines the Companys operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories. The Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Control, Treasury, and Legal and Compliance Departments (collectively, the Company Control Groups), which are all independent of the Companys 88 Table of Contents business units, assist senior management and the Firm Risk Committee in monitoring and controlling the Companys risk through a number of control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Companys risk management and monitoring systems and processes. Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for ensuring that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the Firm Risk Committee; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls. Each of the Companys business segments also has designated operations officers, committees and groups, including operations and information technology groups (collectively, Segment Control Groups and, together with the Company Control Groups, the Control Groups) to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee. The Control Groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the business segments market, credit and operational risk profile, sales practices, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Control Groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review. The following is a discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (other than funding and liquidity risk). The discussion focuses on the Companys securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and corporate lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Companys market risk exposure generated by the Companys statistical analyses are forward looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below. Market Risk. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business where the substantial majority of the Companys Value at Risk (VaR) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading related market risk within the Global Wealth Management Group. Asset Management incurs non trading market risk primarily from capital investments in real estate funds and investments in private equity vehicles. Sound market risk management is an integral part of the Companys culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent. The Control Groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Companys risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains the Companys VaR system. A variety of limits is designed to control price and market liquidity risk. Market risk is monitored through various measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses 89 Table of Contents conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management. Recent Market Conditions. Recent unprecedented events in the global markets (see Executive Summary Global Market and Economic Conditions in Fiscal 2008 Part II, Item 7 herein) are significantly outside the loss estimates forecast by VaR models and are more commonly measured by alternative risk measures such as stress tests and scenario analysis. In fiscal 2008, the Company continued to enhance these alternative risk measures to better reflect exposures arising from certain products (e.g., securitized products). The Company continues to improve its risk measurement using stress tests and scenario analysis and has refined its market risk limit framework. These actions, however, may not address the potential severity of possible losses as actual market moves may continue to be more dramatic than the estimates included in the Companys VaR, stress tests and scenario analyses. For a further discussion on limitations to VaR models, see VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations below. Sales and Trading and Related Activities. Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management. During fiscal 2008, the Company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities. The Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which the Company is active include, but are not limited to, the following: emerging market corporate and government debt, non investment grade and distressed corporate debt, investment grade corporate debt and asset backed debt (including mortgage related securities). The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions (including positions in non public entities). Positions in non public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non U.S. dollar denominated financial instruments. The Company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related derivatives. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production, transportation and storage issues; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities. The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of 90 Table of Contents positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Companys aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management. Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management. The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Companys trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing VaR and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses. The Companys trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures. Net exposure, defined as the potential loss to the Company over a period of time in the event of default of a referenced asset, assuming zero recovery, is one key risk measure the Company employs to standardize the aggregation of market risk exposures across cash and derivative products. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and the Market Risk Department. The Market Risk Department also conducts scenario analyses, which estimate the Companys revenue sensitivity to a set of specific, predefined market and geopolitical events. Value at Risk (VaR). The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR based risk measures to various levels of management. VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. The Company estimates VaR using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors (market risk factors); and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. The Companys VaR model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Companys 95%/one day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. The Companys VaR model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk, interest rate risk and credit spread risk and linear exposures to implied volatility risks. Market risks that are incorporated in the VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities. The VaR model also captures certain correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks between corporate debt and related credit derivatives. As a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors, the Companys VaR model uses Monte Carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products (i.e., corporate bonds, loans, and credit derivatives). 91 Table of Contents The Companys VaR models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. The Company is committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. In response to increased levels of market volatility realized during fiscal 2008, the Company has reviewed the appropriateness of the implementation of its VaR models and has made certain changes to more accurately capture risks generated by certain fixed income products. These changes include additional historical time series that provide broader product coverage of subprime consumer and other mortgage products as well as updated mappings of risk exposures to historical price time series. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks; reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities; and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodologys limitations, which include the following: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. The Company is aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and control at the trading desk, division and Company levels. VaR for Fiscal 2008. The table below presents the Companys Aggregate, Trading and Non trading VaR for each of the Companys primary market risk exposures at November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the Companys trading businesses. This measure of VaR incorporates most of the Companys trading related market risks. However, a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in VaR, and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different VaR results from those produced using more precise measures. For example, risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely the relevant microeconomic factors that affect mortgage prices within a VaR context. Aggregate VaR also incorporates certain non trading risks, including (a) the interest rate risk generated by funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions, (b) public company equity positions recorded as investments by the Company and (c) corporate loan exposures that are awaiting distribution to the market. Investments made by the Company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the VaR results presented below. Aggregate VaR also excludes certain funding liabilities primarily related to fixed and other non trading assets. The credit spread risk generated by the Companys funding liabilities is not included in the Companys Aggregate VaR calculations. As of November 30, 2008, the notional amount of funding liabilities related to non trading assets (including premises, equipment and software, goodwill, deferred tax assets and intangible assets) was approximately $8.7 billion, with a duration of approximately 11 years. The credit spread risk sensitivity generated by the Companys funding liabilities (i.e., those funding both trading and non trading assets) corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $81 million for each +1 basis point (or 1/100th of a percentage point) widening in the Companys credit spread level as of November 30, 2008. 92 Table of Contents Since the VaR statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses which, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount. The table below presents 95%/one day VaR for each of the Companys primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007. Aggregate(Trading and Non trading) Trading Non trading Table 1: 95% Total VaR 95%/One Day VaRat November 30, 95%/One Day VaRat November 30, 95%/One Day VaRat November 30, Primary Market Risk Category 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 127 $ 52 $ 98 $ 45 $ 67 $ 33 Equity price 23 40 23 39 4 4 Foreign exchange rate 14 24 14 25 2 1 Commodity price 23 34 23 34 Subtotal 187 150 158 143 73 38 Less diversification benefit(1) 52 67 54 65 6 5 Total VaR $ 135 $ 83 $ 104 $ 78 $ 67 $ 33 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between Total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category. The Companys Aggregate VaR at November 30, 2008 was $135 million compared with $83 million at November 30, 2007. The increase in Aggregate VaR at year end was driven primarily by a substantial increase in interest rate and credit spread VaR, partially offset by decreases in equity price, foreign exchange rate and commodity price VaR. The Companys Trading VaR at November 30, 2008 was $104 million compared with $78 million at November 30, 2007. The increase in Trading VaR at year end was driven primarily by a substantial increase in interest rate and credit spread VaR, partially offset by decreases in equity price, foreign exchange rate and commodity price VaR. Non trading VaR at November 30, 2008 increased to $67 million from $33 million at November 30, 2007 primarily due to an increase in interest rate and credit spread VaR. The Company views average Trading VaR over a period of time as more representative of trends in the business than VaR at any single point in time. Table 2 below, which presents the high, low and average 95%/one day Trading VaR during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, represents substantially all of the Companys trading activities. Certain market risks included in the year end Aggregate VaR discussed above are excluded from these measures (e.g., equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the Company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions). Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2008 increased to $98 million from $87 million in fiscal 2007, driven by increases in interest rate and credit spread VaR and foreign exchange rate VaR. Average Total VaR for fiscal 2008 increased to $115 million from $92 million in fiscal 2007, which was also driven by increases in interest rate and credit spread VaR and foreign exchange rate VaR. The increase in interest rate and credit spread VaR 93 Table of Contents was predominately driven by increased volatility in interest rate and credit spread sensitive products, especially securities that reference mortgage backed securities. The increase in foreign exchange rate VaR was driven by increased exposure to foreign currencies. Average Non trading VaR for fiscal 2008 increased to $53 million from $22 million in fiscal 2007, driven primarily by increased exposures associated with certain Non trading lending positions. Table 2: 95% High/Low/Average Trading and Non Trading VaR Daily 95%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2008 Daily 95%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2007 Primary Market Risk Category High Low Average High Low Average (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 101 $ 42 $ 69 $ 88 $ 34 $ 46 Equity price 53 17 35 61 29 43 Foreign exchange rate 40 12 25 33 10 18 Commodity price 44 22 35 48 28 37 Trading VaR 114 78 98 108 69 87 Non trading VaR 96 29 53 61 11 22 Total VaR 143 82 115 123 70 92 VaR Statistics under Varying Assumptions. VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the breadth of products included in each firms VaR model, in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market factors, and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the simulated market conditions. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates for similar portfolios. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms. Table 3 below presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (95% versus 99%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four years versus one year) for market data upon which it bases its simulations: Table 3: Average 95% and 99% Trading VaR with Four Year/One Year Historical Time Series Average 95%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2008 Average 99%/One Day VaRfor Fiscal 2008 Primary Market Risk Category Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History Four YearFactor History One YearFactor History (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 69 $ 123 $ 168 $ 258 Equity price 35 38 55 67 Foreign exchange rate 25 25 39 37 Commodity price 35 33 54 51 Trading VaR 98 130 176 263 In addition, if the Company were to report Trading VaR (using a four year historical time series) with respect to a 10 day holding period, the Companys 95% and 99% Average Trading VaR for fiscal 2008 would have been $311 million and $556 million, respectively. 94 Table of Contents Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for Fiscal 2008. As shown in Table 2 above, the Companys average 95%/one day Trading VaR for fiscal 2008 was $98 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 95%/one day Trading VaR for fiscal 2008. The most frequently occurring value was between $97 million and $103 million, while for approximately 92% of trading days during the fiscal year, VaR ranged between $88 million and $109 million. One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the Companys VaR model as a measure of the Companys potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra day trading, for a 95%/one day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the fiscal year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the accuracy of the VaR model could be questioned. Accordingly, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results. For days where losses exceed the 95% or 99% VaR statistic, the Company examines the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR models accuracy relative to realized trading results. The Company incurred daily trading losses in excess of the 95%/one day Trading VaR on 18 days during fiscal 2008. Most of these losses were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a period of unprecedented volatility across the equity, corporate credit and securitized product markets (e.g., the fourth quarter provided the majority of the most volatile stock market days in the past 60 years and major indexes lost approximately 30% in the quarter). Since the Company bases its VaR calculations on four years of equally weighted historical data, clustering of VaR exceptions should occur during periods of exceptionally high market turbulence. An examination of the 18 outliers incurred during the fiscal year revealed that these losses occurred on days when markets experienced unusually high price volatility. Over the longer term, trading losses are expected to exceed VaR an average of three times per quarter at the 95% confidence level. The Company bases its VaR calculations on the long term (or unconditional) distribution and, 95 Table of Contents therefore, evaluates its risk from a longer term perspective, which avoids understating risk during periods of relatively lower volatility in the market. The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net trading revenue during fiscal 2008 for the Companys trading businesses (including net interest and non agency commissions but excluding certain non trading revenues such as primary, fee based and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses). During fiscal 2008, the Company experienced net trading losses on 76 days. These loss days were driven predominately by increased market volatility realized during the second half of the fiscal year. Credit Risk. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower, counterparty or obligor does not meet its financial obligations. The Company is exposed to two distinct types of credit risk in its businesses. The Company incurs significant, single name credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities business and to a lesser extent through its commercial lending activity in its Global Wealth Management Group. This type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis. The Company also incurs individual consumer credit risk in the Global Wealth Management Group business through margin and non purpose loans to individual investors, which are collateralized by securities. The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed discretely. The Institutional Credit Department (Institutional Credit) evaluates and monitors credit risk exposure for the Institutional Securities business segment. Institutional Credit is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment is managed through various credit risk committees, whose membership includes Institutional Credit. The Global Wealth Management Group Risk Management Department is responsible for monitoring, measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures, including margin loans and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions. 96 Table of Contents Institutional Securities Activities. Corporate Lending. In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. Such loans and commitments can generally be classified as either event driven or relationship driven. Event driven loans and commitments refer to activities associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition or recapitalization transactions. The commitments associated with these event driven activities may not be indicative of the Companys actual funding requirements since funding is contingent upon a proposed transaction being completed. In addition, the borrower may not fully utilize the commitment or the Companys portion of the commitment may be reduced through the syndication process. The borrowers ability to draw on the commitment is also subject to certain terms and conditions, among other factors. The borrowers of event driven lending transactions may be investment grade or non investment grade. The Company risk manages its exposures in connection with event driven transactions through various means, including syndication, distribution and or hedging. Relationship driven loans and commitments are generally made to expand business relationships with select clients. The commitments associated with relationship driven activities may not be indicative of the Companys actual funding requirements, as the commitment may expire unused or the borrower may not fully utilize the commitment. The borrowers of relationship driven lending transactions may be investment grade or non investment grade. The Company may hedge its exposures in connection with relationship driven transactions. Securitized Products. The Company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, corporate and operating company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value. Other. In addition to the activities performed by Institutional Credit, there are credit risks managed by various business areas within Institutional Securities. For example, certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits. Certain risk management activities as they pertain to establishing appropriate collateral amounts for the Companys prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. Derivative Contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams, exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and equity warrants typically have longer maturities. The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Companys exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants, and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities, or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 97 Table of Contents Analyzing Credit Risk. Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, counterparty and portfolio levels. In order to help protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities, Institutional Credit analyzes all material lending and derivative transactions and ensures that the creditworthiness of the Companys counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. Institutional Credit assigns obligor credit ratings to the Companys counterparties and borrowers. These credit ratings are intended to assess a counterpartys probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or below are considered non investment grade. Additionally, for lending transactions, Institutional Credit evaluates the relative position of the Companys particular obligation in the borrowers capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as collateral (if applicable) and other structural elements of the particular transaction. The Company has credit guidelines that limit potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties. Institutional Credit administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits. Risk Mitigation. The Company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments which may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign or sub participate funded loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company may enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterpartys rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default. Credit Exposure Corporate Lending. The following table presents information about the Companys corporate funded loans and lending commitments as of November 30, 2008. The total corporate lending exposure column includes both lending commitments and funded loans. Funded loans represent loans that have been drawn by the borrower and that were outstanding as of November 30, 2008. Lending commitments represent legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients as of November 30, 2008 for both relationship driven and event driven lending transactions. As discussed above, these loans and lending commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, may be secured or unsecured, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by the Company. At November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, the aggregate amount of investment grade loans was $8.3 billion and $13.0 billion, respectively, and the aggregate amount of non investment grade loans was $9.5 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, the aggregate amount of lending commitments outstanding was $42.4 billion and $70.2 billion, respectively. In connection with these corporate lending activities (which include corporate funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges (which include single name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $35.8 billion and $37.6 billion at November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, respectively. The table below shows the Companys credit exposure from its corporate lending positions and commitments as of November 30, 2008. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: 98 Table of Contents Corporate Lending Commitments and Funded Loans Years to Maturity Total CorporateLendingExposure(2) CorporateFundedLoans TotalCorporateLendingCommitments Credit Rating(1) Less than 1 1 3 3 5 Over 5 (dollars in millions) AAA $ 839 $ 114 $ 1,425 $ $ 2,378 $ 114 $ 2,264 AA 2,697 527 3,511 73 6,808 40 6,768 A 3,955 4,779 6,424 69 15,227 2,333 12,894 BBB 3,157 7,010 8,849 305 19,321 5,870 13,451 Investment grade 10,648 12,430 20,209 447 43,734 8,357 35,377 Non investment grade 1,285 2,851 5,477 6,890 16,503 9,454 7,049 Total $ 11,933 $ 15,281 $ 25,686 $ 7,337 $ 60,237 $ 17,811 $ 42,426 (1) Obligor credit ratings are determined by Institutional Credit using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies.

Country Exposure. As of November 30, 2008, primarily based on the domicile of the counterparty, approximately 10% of the Companys credit exposure (for credit exposure arising from corporate loans and lending commitments as discussed above and current exposure arising from the Companys OTC derivatives contracts) was to emerging markets, and no one emerging market country accounted for more than 3.2% of the Companys credit exposure. The Company defines emerging markets to include generally all countries that are 101 Table of Contents not members of the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development and includes as well the Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Turkey but excludes countries rated AA and Aa2 or above by Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Service, respectively.

Margin Lending. Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, possible hedging strategies. Additionally, transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. At November 30, 2008, there were approximately $4.5 billion of customer margin loans outstanding. Non purpose Securities Based Lending. Non purpose securities based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any suitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carrying marketable securities or refinancing margin debt. The Company establishes approved lines and advance rates against qualifying securities and monitors limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of non purpose securities based lending are amount of the loan, the degree of concentrated or restricted positions, and the overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, possible hedging strategies. Underlying collateral for non purpose securities based loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. Commercial Lending. Global Wealth Management Group provides structured credit facilities to high net worth individuals and their small and medium size domestic businesses through Morgan Stanley Commercial Financial Services, Inc. (CFS). CFS suite of products includes working capital lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and commercial real estate mortgages. Clients are required to submit a credit application and financial statements to CFS centralized credit processing platform. CFS underwriting professionals recommend a lending structure following an analysis of the borrower, the guarantor, the collateral, cash flow, liquidity, leverage and credit history. For standard transactions, credit requests are approved via signature of independent credit officers, and where transactions are of size and higher complexity, approval is secured through a formal loan committee chaired by independent credit professionals. The facility is risk rated and upon credit approval is moved to the general portfolio where it is monitored periodically through account management, covenants compliance certificates, and spot and cycle audits. Consumer Lending Activities. With respect to first mortgages and second mortgages, including home equity lines of credit (mortgage lending), a loan evaluation process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting policies and collateral 103 Table of Contents valuation. The Companys underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis of applicable industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., FICO scores), debt ratios and reserves of the borrower. Loan to collateral value ratios are determined based on independent third party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. As part of the mortgage lending business strategy, almost all loans are sold in the secondary market through securitizations and whole loan sales, while almost all servicing rights are retained. These sales and securitizations pass the risk of credit loss onto the purchaser/investor. Operational Risk. Operational risk refers to the risk of financial or other loss, or potential damage to a firms reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events (e.g., external or internal fraud, legal and compliance risks, damage to physical assets, etc.). The Company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and support functions (e.g., information technology and facilities management). Legal and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under Legal Risk. The goal of the Companys operational risk management framework is to establish firm wide operational risk standards related to risk measurement, monitoring and management. Operational risk policies are designed to reduce the likelihood and or impact of operational incidents as well as to mitigate legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework continually responds to changing regulatory and business environment landscape. As a foundation for the Basel II Advanced Measurement Approach, an enhanced risk based capital model has been developed for the calculation of capital related to operational risk. This model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements, including internal and external operational incidents, metrics, risk and control self assessments and scenario analysis. The Operational Risk Oversight Committee, a Firm wide committee, is chaired by the Companys Chief Risk Officer, and assists the Firm Risk Committee in executing its responsibilities for oversight of operational risk, including evaluating assessments of risk exposure, reviewing the Companys significant operational risk exposures, recommending and overseeing firmwide remediation efforts, review and evaluation of current event risk issues, and establishing firmwide operational risk program standards related to risk measurement, monitoring and management. The Companys Operational Risk Manager (ORM) oversees, monitors, measures, analyzes and reports on operational risk across the Company. The ORM is independent of the business segments and is supported by the Firm wide Operational Risk Department (ORD). The ORM is also responsible for facilitating, designing, implementing and monitoring the Firm wide operational risk program. The ORD works with the business segments and Control Groups to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Company, globally. Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the Control Groups, and the business managers therein. The business managers, generally, maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. As new products and business activities are developed and processes are designed and modified, operational risks are considered. Each business segment has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports with senior management within each business. Each Control Group also has a designated operational risk coordinator, or equivalent, and a forum for discussing operational risk matters and or reports with senior management. Oversight of business segment operational risk is provided by business segment risk committees, the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, senior management through the Firm Risk Committee. Business Continuity Management is an ongoing program of analysis and planning that ensures a recovery strategy and required resources for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other 104 Table of Contents business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a Company wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of the Companys disaster recovery plans include: crisis management; business segment recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing. The Company maintains an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and satisfies regulatory requirements. Information security procedures are designed to protect the Companys information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These procedures cover a broad range of areas, including: application system entitlement; data protection; internet and intranet access, communications and usage; and mobile and portable information usage. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computer and other assets from unauthorized access. The Company utilizes the services of external vendors in connection with the Companys ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of means, including service level and other contractual agreements, service and quality reviews, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the future. Legal Risk. Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see Business Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Legal and Compliance Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Companys policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company. 105 Table of Contents
