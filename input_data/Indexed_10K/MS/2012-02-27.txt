Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction. Morgan Stanley, a financial holding company, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments Institutional Securities, Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management. The Company, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Morgan Stanley and the Company mean Morgan Stanley and its consolidated subsidiaries. A summary of the activities of each of the Companys business segments is as follows: Institutional Securities provides capital raising; financial advisory services, including advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance; corporate lending; sales, trading, financing and market making activities in equity and fixed income securities and related products, including foreign exchange and commodities; and investment activities. Global Wealth Management Group, which includes the Companys 51% interest in Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC (MSSB), provides brokerage and investment advisory services to individual investors and small to medium sized businesses and institutions covering various investment alternatives; financial and wealth planning services; annuity and other insurance products; credit and other lending products; cash management services; retirement services; and trust and fiduciary services and engages in fixed income principal trading, which primarily facilitates clients trading or investments in such securities. Asset Management provides a broad array of investment strategies that span the risk/return spectrum across geographies, asset classes and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across the institutional and intermediary channels as well as high net worth clients. See Notes 1 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Companys discontinued operations. The results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by many factors, including the effect of economic and political conditions and geopolitical events; the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income, credit and commodities markets, including corporate and mortgage (commercial and residential) lending and commercial real estate markets; the impact of current, pending and future legislation (including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act)), regulation (including capital, leverage and liquidity requirements), and legal actions in the United States of America (U.S.) and worldwide; the level and volatility of equity, fixed income, and commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; the availability and cost of both credit and capital as well as the credit ratings assigned to the Companys unsecured short term and long term debt; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; the performance of the Companys acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other strategic arrangements (including MSSB and with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG)); the Companys reputation; inflation, natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism; the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors as well as governments, regulators and self regulatory organizations and technological changes; or a combination of these or other factors. In addition, legislative, legal and regulatory developments related to the Companys businesses are likely to increase costs, thereby affecting results of operations. These factors also may have an impact on the Companys ability to achieve its strategic objectives. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect the Companys business, see Business Competition and Business Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1, Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and Other Matters herein. 46 Table of Contents Executive Summary.

N/A Not Applicable. Information is not comparable. (1) Information includes MSSB effective from May 31, 2009 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). (2) See Notes 1 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements for information on discontinued operations. (3) For the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) Regional net revenues include the impact of the fluctuation in the Companys credit spreads and other credit factors (Debt Related Credit Spreads) on certain of the Companys long term and short term borrowings, primarily structured notes, (Borrowings) that are accounted for at fair value. (5) Average common equity is a non Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure to the Company and investors to assess operating performance. The computation of average common equity for each business segment is determined using the Companys Required Capital framework (Required Capital Framework), an internal capital adequacy measure (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Required Capital herein). The Required Capital Framework will evolve over time to respond to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. The Company continues to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements herein for further information on risk based capital, leverage and liquidity standards, known as Basel III, which were proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) in December 2009). The calculation of return on average common equity uses income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity. For 2011, the negative adjustment related to the MUFG stock conversion (see Executive SummarySignificant Items MUFG Stock Conversion herein) of $1,726 million was included in the calculation of the return on average common equity. Excluding this negative adjustment, the return on average common equity for 2011 would have been 12% for the Institutional Securities business segment; 8% for the Global Wealth Management Group business segment; and 1% for the Asset Management business segment. See Liquidity and Capital Resource Required Capital herein for more information on the calculation of the average common equity by business segment. The effective tax rates used in the computation of business segment return on average common equity were determined on a separate entity basis. Excluding the effects of the aggregate discrete tax benefit for 2011, the return on average common equity for the Institutional Securities business segment would have been 5%, (see Executive Summary Significant Items herein). (6) Book value per common share equals common shareholders equity of $60,541 million at December 31, 2011, $47,614 million at December 31, 2010 and $37,091 million at December 31, 2009 divided by common shares outstanding of 1,927 million at December 31, 2011, 1,512 million at December 31, 2010 and 1,361 million at December 31, 2009. Book value per common share in 2011 was reduced by approximately $2.61 per share as a result of the MUFG stock conversion (see Significant Items MUFG Stock Conversion herein). Book value per common share in 2010 included a benefit of approximately $1.40 per share due to the issuance of 116 million shares of common stock in 2010 corresponding to the mandatory redemption of the junior subordinated debentures underlying $5.6 billion of equity units (see Other Matters Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock herein). (7) Tangible common equity is a non GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy. For a discussion of tangible common equity, see Liquidity and Capital Resources The Balance Sheet herein. (8) Tangible book value per common share is a non GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding. (9) For a discussion of the effective income tax rate, see Executive Summary Significant Items herein. (10) For a discussion of average liquidity, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Trading Management Global Liquidity Reserve herein. (11) On December 30, 2011, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) formalized regulatory definitions for Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 common capital ratio. The Companys conformance to the Federal Reserves definition under the 49 Table of Contents final rule reduced its Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 common ratio by approximately $4.2 billion and 132 basis points, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The Companys Total capital ratio, Tier 1 common capital ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio at December 31, 2010 and 2009 have also been adjusted based on revised guidance from the Federal Reserve about the Companys capital treatment for over the counter (OTC) derivative collateral. For a discussion of Total capital ratio, Tier 1 common capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements herein. (12) Revenues and expenses associated with these assets are included in the Companys Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management business segments. (13) Amounts exclude the Asset Management business segments proportionate share of assets managed by entities in which it owns a minority stake. (14) Pre tax profit margin is a non GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess operating performance. Percentages represent income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues. (15) As the business finalizes the integration of its legacy Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney channels in 2012, it is harmonizing what were previously different job descriptions for various licensed roles involved in serving the Companys clients. This adjustment will be reflected in the prospective reporting of global representative headcount as role definition differences are eliminated in the combined sales organization. Amounts represent global representative headcount and productivity metrics reflecting this adjustment. (16) Annualized net revenues per global representative for 2011, 2010 and 2009 equals Global Wealth Management Groups net revenues divided by the quarterly weighted average global representative headcount for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. (17) Client assets per global representative equal total period end client assets divided by period end global representative headcount. (18) Approximately $56 billion, $55 billion and $54 billion of the bank deposit balances at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are held at Company affiliated depositories with the remainder held at Citigroup, Inc. (Citi) affiliated depositories. These deposit balances are held at certain of the Companys Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) insured depository institutions for the benefit of the Companys clients through their accounts. For additional information regarding the Companys deposits, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Management Deposits herein. Global Market and Economic Conditions. During 2011, global market and economic conditions were negatively impacted by concerns about the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the U.S. federal debt ceiling and slower economic growth. Global equity markets were volatile in 2011 as investors reacted to slowing global economic growth and the deepening sovereign debt crisis in the European region. In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Index rose 5.5%; however, most of the other major equity market indices ended 2011 lower compared with the beginning of the year, primarily due to investors anxiety about the continued European sovereign debt crisis, a U.S. economy facing the prospect of a double dip recession and signs of slowing economies in emerging markets. Despite the slowing growth in foreign economies and strains in global financial markets, U.S. economic activity expanded moderately in 2011. Conditions in the labor market improved modestly as the unemployment rate decreased to 8.5% at December 31, 2011 from 9.4% at December 31, 2010. However, certain sectors of the residential real estate market and investments in commercial real estate projects remained challenged in 2011. Growth in consumer spending accelerated in the second half of the year. Inflation rose during the first half of 2011 and moderated during the second half of 2011, primarily reflecting lower prices for certain commodities and imported goods. Concerns about weakening crude oil demand due to slowing economic recovery contributed to a drop in prices of oil and other commodities in the second half of 2011. The U.S. federal debt ceiling, the need for deficit reductions, unbalanced budgets and underfunded public pension liabilities remained critical focus items at the federal, state and local levels of government during 2011. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve kept key interest rates at historically low levels, and at December 31, 2011, the federal funds target rate was between zero and 0.25%, and the discount rate was 0.75%. In an effort to lower long term interest rates and to support economic growth, in September 2011 the FOMC began to purchase $400 billion of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities between six and 30 years and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with maturities of three years or less. In January 2012, the FOMC announced that key interest rates will likely remain at historically low levels at least through late 2014. In Europe, real gross domestic product growth remained moderate in 2011. Major European equity market indices ended 2011 lower compared with the beginning of the year, primarily due to adverse economic developments, including investors growing concerns about the sovereign debt crisis, especially in Greece, 50 Table of Contents Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (the European Peripherals), and the sovereign debt exposures in the European banking system. The euro area unemployment rate increased to 10.4% at December 31, 2011 from 10.0% a year ago. At December 31, 2011, the European Central Banks (ECB) benchmark interest rate was 1.00%, and the Bank of Englands (BOE) benchmark interest rate was 0.50%, both of which were unchanged from a year ago. In 2011, the BOE increased the size of its quantitative easing program by &pound;75 billion to &pound;275 billion in order to inject further monetary stimulus into the economy in the United Kingdom (U.K.). To stabilize the European banking system during the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB initiated a number of actions during the fourth quarter of 2011. The ECB made longer term loans available to banks in exchange for posting of adequate collateral in October and December of 2011 for maturities up to 13 months, ensuring that European banks have unlimited financing into 2013. Starting in November 2011, the ECB also bought 40 billion in European bank bonds backed by mortgages and other assets, known as covered bonds, a key source of funds for banks. On October 27, 2011, leaders of 17 European Union countries announced a financial relief plan that involves a write off of certain sovereign debt by European banks and other measures aimed to resolve the European sovereign debt crisis. In December 2011, European leaders agreed to sign an inter government treaty that would require them to enforce stricter fiscal and financial discipline in their future budgets. In January and February 2012, rating agencies downgraded the credit ratings for several euro zone countries. In Asia, major stock markets closed out 2011 sharply lower compared with the beginning of the year, primarily due to investors concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and slowing economic growth in Asia. Japans economy continued to recover from the adverse impact of the earthquake and tsunami in March of 2011. In 2011, the Bank of Japan enhanced monetary easing by increasing the size of the asset purchase program to 50 trillion yen from 40 trillion yen. Japans benchmark interest rate remained within a range of zero to 0.1% during 2011. Chinas gross domestic product growth moderated during 2011 as import and export growth slowed sharply after domestic tightening measures and global economic turmoil impacted consumption. To combat rising inflation, the Peoples Bank of China (the PBOC) raised benchmark interest rates by 0.25% three times in 2011. In December 2011, in order to stimulate the Chinese economy, the PBOC cut its bank reserve requirement by 0.5%. Overview of 2011 Financial Results. Consolidated Results. The Company recorded net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $4,110 million on net revenues of $32,403 million in 2011, compared with $4,703 million of net income applicable to Morgan Stanley and net revenues of $31,387 million in 2010. Net revenues in 2011 included positive revenue of $3,681 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, due to the impact of the widening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that are accounted for at fair value, compared with negative revenues of $873 million in 2010 due to the impact of the tightening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that were accounted for at fair value. Results for 2011 included the settlement with MBIA Insurance Corporation (MBIA), which resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately $1.7 billion. In addition, the Company recorded a pre tax loss of approximately $783 million arising from its 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (MUMSS). See Executive Summary Significant Items Income Tax Benefits, Executive Summary Significant Items Japanese Securities Joint Venture, and Executive Summary Significant Items Monoline Insurers, herein. Non interest expenses increased 5% to $26,289 million in 2011. Non compensation expenses increased 7% in 2011. Diluted EPS and diluted EPS from continuing operations were $1.23 and $1.26 in 2011, respectively, compared with $2.63 and $2.45, respectively, in 2010. The earnings per share calculation for 2011 included a negative adjustment of approximately $1.7 billion, or $0.98 per diluted share (calculated using 1.79 billion diluted average shares outstanding under the if converted method), related to the conversion of MUFGs outstanding Series B Non Cumulative Non Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) into the Companys common stock. See Executive Summary Significant Items MUFG Stock Conversion herein. 51 Table of Contents The Companys effective tax rates from continuing operations were 23.2% and 12.1% for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rates included aggregate discrete tax benefits of $484 million and $997 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates from continuing operations in 2011 and 2010 would have been 31.1% and 28.1%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily reflective of the geographic mix of earnings. For further discussion of the current and prior year discrete tax benefits, see Executive Summary Significant Items Income Tax Benefits herein. Institutional Securities. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $4,585 million in 2011 compared with $4,372 million in 2010. Net revenues were $17,208 million in 2011 compared with $16,169 million in 2010. Investment banking revenues for 2011 decreased 2% to $4,228 million from 2010, reflecting lower revenues from equity and fixed income underwriting transactions, partially offset by higher advisory revenues. Investment banking revenues were also impacted by the contribution in 2010 of the majority of the Companys Japanese investment banking business as a result of a transaction with MUFG (see Other Matters Japanese Securities Joint Venture herein). Equity sales and trading revenues increased 40% to $6,770 million in 2011. The increase was due to higher revenues, primarily reflecting higher levels of client activity, higher average client balances and positive revenue of $619 million due to the impact of the widening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that are accounted for at fair value compared with negative revenue of approximately $121 million in 2010 due to the impact of the tightening of the Companys Debt Related Credits Spreads on Borrowings that were accounted for at fair value. Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues increased 27% to $7,507 million in 2011 compared with $5,900 million in 2010. Results in 2011 included positive revenue of $3,062 million due to the impact of the widening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that are accounted for at fair value, compared with negative revenues of $703 million in 2010 due to the impact of the tightening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that were accounted for at fair value. Fixed income revenues were negatively impacted by losses of $1,838 million from Monoline Insurers (Monolines) compared with losses of $865 million in 2010. The results in 2011 included the $1.7 billion settlement with MBIA (see Executive Summary Significant Items Monoline Insurers, herein). The results in 2011 also included approximately $600 million primarily related to the release of credit valuation adjustments upon the restructuring of certain derivatives transactions which decreased its exposure to the European Peripherals. Other sales and trading net losses of $1.3 billion primarily reflected losses associated with corporate lending activity and costs related to liquidity held. Principal transactions net investment gains of $239 million were recognized in 2011 compared with net investment gains of $809 million in 2010. Other losses of $207 million were recognized in 2011 compared with other revenues of $766 million in 2010. In 2011, pre tax losses of approximately $783 million were from the Companys 40% stake in MUMSS, partially offset by gains from the Companys retirement of its debt. Non interest expenses increased 7% and Compensation and benefits expenses increased 3% in 2011. Non compensation expenses increased 12% in 2011, which included a 44% increase in Other expenses. The increase in Other expenses was primarily due to the initial costs of $130 million associated with Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities Company Limited, and a charge of $59 million due to the bank levy on relevant liabilities and equities on the consolidated balance sheets of U.K. Banking Groups, at December 31, 2011 as defined under the bank levy legislation enacted by the U.K. government in July 2011 (see Executive Summary Significant Items U.K. Matters herein for further information). Global Wealth Management Group. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,276 million in 2011 compared with $1,156 million in 2010. Net revenues were $13,423 million in 2011 compared with $12,636 million in 2010. Investment banking revenues decreased 9% to $750 million in 2011, primarily due to lower equity and fixed income underwriting activities. Principal transactions trading revenues decreased 14% to $1,122 million in 2011, primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and lower revenues from corporate equity and fixed income securities, government securities and structured notes, partially offset by higher revenues from municipal securities, derivatives and unit trusts. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 8% to $6,884 million in 2011, primarily 52 Table of Contents due to higher fee based revenues, partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the change in classification of the fees generated by the bank deposit program. Net interest increased 32% to $1,483 million in 2011, primarily resulting from an increase in Interest income due to interest on the securities available for sale portfolio and mortgages and the change in classification of the fees generated by the bank deposit program. Other revenues increased 22% to $410 million in 2011, primarily due to gains on sales of securities available for sale. Non interest expenses increased 6% to $12,147 million in 2011. Asset Management. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $253 million in 2011 compared with $718 million in 2010. Net revenues were $1,887 million in 2011 compared with $2,685 million in 2010. Principal transactions net investment gains were $330 million in 2011 compared with gains of $996 million in 2010. The decrease in 2011 was primarily related to lower net gains in the Companys Merchant Banking and Traditional Asset Management businesses, including certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans, as well as lower net investment gains associated with certain consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company. Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 3% to $1,582 million in 2011, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and fund management and administration fees, primarily due to the absence of FrontPoint Partners LLC (FrontPoint) for ten months of the current year. Non interest expenses decreased 17% to $1,634 million in 2011, primarily reflecting a decrease in compensation expenses. Significant Items. Morgan Stanley Debt. Net revenues reflected positive revenues of $3,681 million in 2011 and negative revenues of $873 million and $5.5 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the impact of changes in the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that are accounted for at fair value. In addition, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded gains (losses) of approximately $155 million, $(27) million and $491 million, respectively, related to the Companys retirement of its debt. The results in 2009 also reflected the amortization of the value of the de designated hedges related to the Companys retirement of its debt. Monoline Insurers. The results for 2011 included losses of $1,838 million related to the Companys counterparty credit exposures to Monolines, principally MBIA, compared with losses of $865 million in 2010 and $232 million in 2009. On December 13, 2011, the Company announced a comprehensive settlement with MBIA. The settlement terminated outstanding credit default swap (CDS) protection purchased from MBIA on commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and resolved pending litigation between the two parties for consideration of a net cash payment to the Company. The pre tax loss on the settlement, which was recorded as a reduction to Fixed income and commodities revenue, approximated $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2011. The settlement has the effect of significantly reducing risk weighted assets under the Basel Committees proposed Basel III framework, thereby increasing the pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III by approximately 75 basis points by the end of 2012. The pro forma Tier 1 common capital ratio under Basel III is a non GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be a useful measure that the Company and investors use to assess capital adequacy. The Basel III estimates are preliminary and may change based on guidelines for implementation to be issued by the Federal Reserve. Under current Basel I standards, the Tier 1 common ratio was reduced by approximately 20 basis points. MUFG Stock Conversion. On June 30, 2011, MUFGs outstanding Series B Preferred Stock with a face value of $7.8 billion (carrying value $8.1 billion) and a 10% dividend was converted into 385,464,097 shares of the Companys common stock, including approximately 75 million shares resulting from the adjustment to the conversion ratio pursuant to the transaction agreement. As a result of the adjustment to the conversion ratio, the Company incurred a one time, non cash negative adjustment of approximately $1.7 billion in its calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share during 2011. As a result of the conversion, MUFG did not receive the previously declared dividend that otherwise would have been payable on July 15, 2011 with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock. 53 Table of Contents Japanese Securities Joint Venture.

In 2011, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $447 million from the remeasurement of a deferred tax asset and the reversal of a related valuation allowance. The deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were recognized in income from discontinued operations in 2010 in connection with the recognition of a $1.2 billion loss due to writedowns and related costs following the Companys commitment to a plan to dispose of Revel. The Company recorded the valuation allowance because the Company did not believe it was more likely than not that it would have sufficient future net capital gain to realize the benefit of the expected capital loss to be recognized upon the disposal of Revel. During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, the disposal of Revel was restructured as a tax free like kind exchange and the disposal was completed. The restructured transaction changed the character of the future taxable loss to ordinary. The Company reversed the valuation allowance because the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will have sufficient future ordinary taxable income to recognize the recorded deferred tax asset. In accordance with the applicable accounting literature, this reversal of a previously established valuation allowance due to a change in circumstances was recognized in income from continuing operations during the quarter ended March 31, 2011. Additionally, in 2011 the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $137 million related to the reversal of U.S. deferred tax liabilities associated with prior years undistributed earnings of certain non U.S. subsidiaries that were determined to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, and a discrete tax cost of $100 million related to the remeasurement of Japan deferred tax assets as a result of a decrease in the local statutory income tax rates starting in 2012. In 2010, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of $382 million related to the reversal of U.S. deferred tax liabilities associated with prior years undistributed earnings of certain non U.S. subsidiaries that were determined to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, $345 million associated with the remeasurement of net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest based on new information regarding the status of federal and state examinations, and $277 million associated with the planned repatriation of non U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated.

The results of MSCI are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of sale. The results of MSCI were formerly included in the continuing operations of the Institutional Securities business segment. Business Segments. Substantially all of the Companys operating revenues and operating expenses can be directly attributed to its business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective revenues or other relevant measures. 56 Table of Contents As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the Company includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the Companys consolidated results. Intersegment Eliminations also reflect the effect of fees paid by the Institutional Securities business segment to the Global Wealth Management Group business segment related to the bank deposit program. The Company did not recognize any Intersegment Elimination gains or losses in 2011. Losses from continuing operations before income taxes recorded in Intersegment Eliminations were $15 million and $11 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net Revenues. Principal Transactions Trading. Principal transactions Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the Company acts as principal and gains and losses on the Companys positions, as well as proprietary trading activities for its own account. Principal transactions Trading revenues includes the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of the Companys positions related to market making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in this line item since they relate to market making positions. Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in the Commissions and fees line item. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them and fees for related services would be recorded in Commissions and fees. Principal Transactions Investments. The Companys investments generally are held for long term appreciation and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. In some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products. The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of the Companys holdings as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The sales restrictions on the investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in real estate funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time that the Company is clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse. Additionally, there are certain principal investments related to assets held by consolidated real estate funds, which are primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests. Commissions and Fees. Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing, and the distribution of certain open ended mutual funds. Asset management, distribution and administration fees in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment also include revenues from individual investors electing a fee based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management. Mutual fund distribution fees in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision. 57 Table of Contents Asset management fees in the Asset Management business segment arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance based fees in the Asset Management business segment are earned on certain funds as a percentage of appreciation earned by those funds and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis. Net Interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, securities available for sale, securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, loans, deposits, commercial paper and other short term borrowings, long term borrowings, trading strategies, customer activity in the Companys prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and Securities borrowed and Securities loaned transactions may be entered into with different customers using the same underlying securities, thereby generating a spread between the interest revenue on the reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowed transactions and the interest expense on the repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions. Market Making. As a market maker, the Company stands ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. The Companys liquidity obligations can be explicit and obligatory in some cases, and in others, customers expect the Company to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill its market making function, the Company engages in activities, across all of its trading businesses, that include, but are not limited to, (i) taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to customer demand to buy or sell, and depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position holding those positions for a period of time; (ii) managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks; (iii) building, maintaining, and re balancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engaging in accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand; (iv) trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and (v) engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. Interest income and expense are also impacted by market making activities as debt securities held by the Company earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell. 58 Table of Contents INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Revenues: Investment banking $ 4,228 $ 4,295 $ 4,455 Principal transactions: Trading 11,299 8,154 6,592 Investments 239 809 (864 ) Commissions and fees 2,610 2,274 2,152 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 124 104 98 Other (207 ) 766 415 Total non interest revenues 18,293 16,402 12,848 Interest income 5,740 5,910 6,373 Interest expense 6,825 6,143 6,479 Net interest (1,085 ) (233 ) (106 ) Net revenues 17,208 16,169 12,742 Compensation and benefits 7,204 6,971 7,123 Non compensation expenses 5,419 4,826 4,380 Total non interest expenses 12,623 11,797 11,503 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 4,585 4,372 1,239 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 880 316 (256 ) Income from continuing operations 3,705 4,056 1,495 Discontinued operations: Income (loss) from discontinued operations (199 ) (1,210 ) 246 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (107 ) 10 185 Net gain (losses) on discontinued operations (92 ) (1,220 ) 61 Net income 3,613 2,836 1,556 Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests 244 290 12 Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley $ 3,369 $ 2,546 $ 1,544 Amounts applicable to Morgan Stanley: Income from continuing operations $ 3,461 $ 3,766 $ 1,499 Net gain (losses) from discontinued operations (92 ) (1,220 ) 45 Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley $ 3,369 $ 2,546 $ 1,544 Noncontrolling Interests.

See Business Segments Net Revenues herein for further information about what is included in sales and trading revenues. In assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the Company views these net revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to principal transactions are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the Companys positions, and other related expenses. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to gains (losses) on derivative instruments. Sales and trading revenues were as follows: 2011 2010(1) 2009(1) (dollars in millions) Principal transactions Trading $ 11,299 $ 8,154 $ 6,592 Commissions and fees 2,610 2,274 2,152 Asset management, distribution and administration fees 124 104 98 Net interest (1,085 ) (233 ) (106 ) Total sales and trading revenues $ 12,948 $ 10,299 $ 8,736 (1) All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Sales and Trading Reorganization. Effective March 31, 2011, the Institutional Securities business segments fixed income business has been renamed the fixed income and commodities business. The interest rate, credit and currency business has been renamed the fixed income business. These name changes did not affect current or previously reported results for these businesses. Sales and trading revenues were as follows: 2011 2010(1) 2009(1) (dollars in millions) Equity $ 6,770 $ 4,840 $ 3,690 Fixed income and commodities 7,507 5,900 4,872 Other(2) (1,329 ) (441 ) 174 Total sales and trading revenues $ 12,948 $ 10,299 $ 8,736 (1) All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.

Other sales and trading net revenues also include gains (losses) on economic hedges related to the Companys long term debt and net losses associated with costs related to the amount of liquidity held (negative carry). 2011 Compared with 2010. Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues in 2011 decreased 2% from 2010, reflecting lower revenues from equity and fixed income underwriting transactions, partially offset by higher advisory revenues. Overall, underwriting revenues of $2,491 million decreased 12% from 2010, reflecting lower levels of market activity. Investment banking revenues were also impacted by the contribution in 2010 of the majority of the Companys Japanese investment banking business as a result of a transaction with MUFG (see Other Matters Japanese Securities Joint Venture herein). Equity underwriting revenues decreased 22% to $1,132 million in 2011. Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 1% to $1,359 million in 2011. Advisory revenues from merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions were $1,737 million in 2011, an increase of 18% from 2010, reflecting higher levels of completed activity. 61 Table of Contents Sales and Trading Revenues. Total sales and trading revenues increased to $12,948 million in 2011 from $10,299 million in 2010, reflecting higher equity and fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher losses in other sales and trading revenues. Equity. Equity sales and trading revenues increased 40% to $6,770 million in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to higher revenues in the derivatives business, the Companys electronic trading platform and prime brokerage. The increase in the derivatives business and the Companys electronic trading platform primarily reflected higher levels of client activity. The increase in prime brokerage net revenues was primarily due to higher average client balances. The results in equity sales and trading revenues also included positive revenue in 2011 of $619 million due to the impact of the widening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that are accounted for at fair value compared with negative revenue of $121 million in 2010 due to the impact of the tightening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that were accounted for at fair value. In 2011, equity sales and trading revenues also reflected unrealized losses of $38 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of counterparties credit default swap spreads and other credit factors compared with unrealized gains of $20 million in 2010 due to the tightening of counterparties credit default swap spreads and other credit factors. The Company also recorded unrealized gains of $182 million in 2011 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads and other credit factors compared with unrealized gains of $31 million in 2010. The unrealized gains and losses on credit default swap spreads and other credit factors do not reflect any gains or losses on related hedging instruments. Fixed Income and Commodities. Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues increased 27% to $7,507 million in 2011 from $5,900 million in 2010. Results in 2011 included positive revenue of $3,062 million due to the impact of the widening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that are accounted for at fair value, compared with negative revenues of $703 million in 2010 due to the impact of the tightening of the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings that were accounted for at fair value. Fixed income revenues, excluding the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings, in 2011 decreased 30% over 2010. Results in 2011 were negatively impacted by losses of $1,838 million from Monolines compared with losses of $865 million in 2010. On December 13, 2011, the Company announced a comprehensive settlement with MBIA. The loss on the settlement was approximately $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011 (see Executive Summary Significant Items Monoline Insurers herein for further information). The results in 2011 also reflected lower revenues in credit products due to the stressed credit environment and lower revenues in currency products, partially offset by higher revenues in interest rate products due to higher levels of market volatility and client activity and approximately $600 million primarily related to the release of credit valuation adjustments upon the restructuring of certain derivative transactions which decreased its exposure to the European Peripherals (see Executive Summary Significant Items European Peripheral Countries herein for further information). Commodity revenues, excluding the Companys Debt Related Credit Spreads on Borrowings, decreased 18% in 2011, primarily due to lower levels of client activity, including structured transactions. Results in the fourth quarter of 2011 included a loss of approximately $108 million upon application of the OIS curve to certain fixed income products. Results in 2010 included a gain of approximately $123 million related to a change in the fair value measurement methodology to use the OIS curve as an input to value substantially all collateralized interest rate derivative contracts (see Executive Summary Significant Items OIS Fair Value Measurement herein and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). In 2011, fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues reflected net unrealized gains of $1,625 million related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the tightening of counterparties credit default swap spreads and other credit factors compared with unrealized gains of $603 million in 2010. The Company also recorded unrealized gains of $1,750 million in 2011 related to changes in the fair value of net derivative contracts attributable to the widening of the Companys credit default swap spreads and other credit factors compared with gains of $287 million in 2010. The unrealized gains and losses on credit default swap spreads and other credit factors do not reflect any gains or losses on related hedging instruments. 62 Table of Contents Other. In addition to the equity and fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues discussed above, sales and trading revenues included other trading revenues, consisting of certain activities associated with the Companys lending activities, gains (losses) on economic hedges related to the Companys long term debt and negative carry. The fair value measurement of loans and lending commitments takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract. The valuation of these commitments could change in future periods depending on, among other things, the extent that they are renegotiated or repriced or if the associated acquisition transaction does not occur.

Trading results in 2011 primarily reflected losses related to certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans and certain consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company. Trading results in 2010 primarily included losses from hedges on certain investments and long term debt. Trading results in 2010 also included $25 million related to contributions to money market funds. Principal Transactions Investments. Real estate and private equity investments generally are held for long term appreciation and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. 72 Table of Contents The Company recorded principal transactions net investment gains of $330 million in 2011 compared with gains of $996 million in 2010. The decrease in 2011 was primarily related to lower net gains in the Companys Merchant Banking and Traditional Asset Management businesses, including certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans, as well as lower net investment gains associated with certain consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees include revenues generated from the management and supervision of assets, performance based fees relating to certain funds, and separately managed accounts and fees relating to the distribution of certain open ended mutual funds. Asset management fees arise from investment management services the Company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. The Company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance based fees are earned on certain funds as a percentage of appreciation earned by those funds and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis. Asset management, distribution and administration fees decreased 3% in 2011. The decrease in 2011 primarily reflected lower performance fees and lower fund management and administration fees, primarily due to the absence of FrontPoint for ten months of the current year, partially offset by an increase in revenue associated with higher average assets under management. The Companys assets under management increased $15 billion from $272 billion at December 31, 2010 to $287 billion at December 31, 2011 reflecting net customer inflows. The Company recorded net customer inflows of $25.8 billion in 2011 compared with net outflows of $5.7 billion in 2010. The increase in flows for 2011 primarily reflected the sweep of MSSB client cash balances of approximately $18.5 billion into Morgan Stanley managed liquidity funds and inflows of $7.9 billion into alternatives funds, partially offset by outflows of $5.5 billion in fixed income products. Other. Other revenues were $25 million in 2011 as compared with $164 million in 2010. The results in 2011 included revenues associated with the Companys minority stake investments in Lansdowne Partners (Lansdowne), a London based investment manager, and Avenue Capital Group (Avenue), a New York based investment manager, partially offset by a $27 million writedown in the Companys minority stake investment in FrontPoint as noted above. The results in 2010 primarily reflected revenues associated with these minority stakes and a pre tax gain of approximately $96 million from the sale of the Companys investment in Invesco (see Notes 5 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements). The results in 2010 also reflected gains associated with the reduction of a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company and impairment charges of $126 million related to FrontPoint. Non interest Expenses. Non interest expenses decreased 17% in 2011 from 2010, primarily reflecting a decrease in compensation expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased 23% in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to the absence of FrontPoint for ten months of the current year and decreases associated with lower net revenues. Non compensation expenses decreased 8% in 2011 compared with the prior year, as the prior year included intangible asset impairment charges of $67 million related to certain FrontPoint management contracts. 2010 Compared with 2009. Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues doubled in 2010 from 2009, primarily reflecting higher revenues from real estate and infrastructure products. Principal Transactions Trading. In 2010, the Company recognized Principal transactions trading losses of $49 million compared with losses of $68 million in 2009. Trading results in 2010 and 2009 included losses from hedges on certain investments and long term debt. Trading results in 2010 also included $25 million related 73 Table of Contents to contributions to money market funds. Trading results in 2009 also included mark to market losses related to a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company, partially offset by gains of $164 million related to structured investment vehicle positions that were previously held on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. Principal Transactions Investments. The Company recorded principal transactions net investment gains of $996 million in 2010 compared with losses of $173 million in 2009. The results in 2010 included a gain of $444 million associated with certain consolidated real estate funds sponsored by the Company and net investment gains in the Merchant Banking and Traditional Asset Management businesses, including certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. The results in 2009 primarily related to net investment losses associated with the Companys real estate investments and losses related to certain investments associated with the Companys employee deferred compensation and co investment plans, partially offset by net investment gains associated with the Companys Merchant Banking business. Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees. Asset management, distribution and administration fees increased 4% in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily reflecting higher fund management and administration fees, partially offset by lower performance fees. The higher fund management and administration fees reflected an increase in average assets under management. The Companys assets under management increased $13 billion from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, reflecting market appreciation, partially offset by net customer outflows, primarily in the Companys money market funds. The Company recorded net customer outflows of $5.7 billion in 2010 compared with net outflows of $41.1 billion in 2009. Other. Other revenues increased $118 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The results in 2010 included a pre tax gain of approximately $96 million from the sale of the Companys investment in Invesco, as mentioned above. The increase in 2010 also reflected gains associated with the reduction of a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the Company and higher revenues associated with the Companys minority stake investments in Avenue and Lansdowne. These increases were partially offset by impairment charges of $126 million related to FrontPoint. Non interest Expenses. Non interest expenses increased 1% in 2010 compared with 2009. The results in 2010 primarily reflected an increase in Compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in Non compensation expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 2% in 2010 due to certain international tax equalization payments and principal investment gains in the current year related to employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. Non compensation expenses for 2010 included intangible asset impairment charges of $67 million related to FrontPoint investment management contracts. 74 Table of Contents Accounting Developments. Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued accounting guidance that removes the requirement to consider whether sufficient collateral is held when determining whether to account for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity as sales or as secured financings. The guidance is effective for the Company prospectively for transactions beginning on January 1, 2012. The Company does not believe the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting update that clarifies existing fair value measurement guidance and changes certain principles or requirements for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements. This update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurement in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance is effective for the Company prospectively beginning on January 1, 2012. The Company does not believe the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Test. In September 2011, the FASB issued accounting guidance that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. This guidance allows entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under that option, an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. This guidance is effective for the Company prospectively beginning on January 1, 2012. The Company does not believe the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 75 Table of Contents Other Matters. Real Estate. The Company acts as the general partner for various real estate funds and also invests in certain of these funds as a limited partner. The Companys real estate investments at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 are described below. Such amounts exclude investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co investment plans. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the consolidated statements of financial condition included amounts representing real estate investment assets of consolidated subsidiaries of approximately $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, including noncontrolling interests of approximately $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for a net amount of $0.4 billion in both periods. This net presentation is a non GAAP financial measure that the Company considers to be the most useful measure for the Company and investors to use in assessing the Companys net exposure. In addition, the Company has contractual capital commitments, guarantees, lending facilities and counterparty arrangements with respect to real estate investments of $0.8 billion at December 31, 2011. In addition to the Companys real estate investments, the Company engages in various real estate related activities, including origination of loans secured by commercial and residential properties. The Company also securitizes and trades in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate. In connection with these activities, the Company has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached. The Company continues to monitor its real estate related activities in order to manage its exposures and potential liability from these markets and businesses. See Legal Proceedings Residential Mortgage and Credit Crisis Related Matters in Part I, Item 3. See Executive Summary Significant Items Real Estate Investments herein and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Securities Available for Sale. During 2010, the Company established a portfolio of debt securities in order to manage interest rate risk. The securities have been classified as securities available for sale in accordance with accounting guidance for investments in debt and equity securities. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on securities available for sale. Japanese Securities Joint Venture. On May 1, 2010, the Company and MUFG formed a joint venture in Japan of their respective investment banking and securities businesses. MUFG and the Company have integrated their respective Japanese securities companies by forming two joint venture companies. MUFG contributed the investment banking, wholesale and retail securities businesses conducted in Japan by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co., Ltd. into MUMSS. The Company contributed the investment banking operations conducted in Japan by its subsidiary, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities, Co., Ltd. (MSMS), formerly known as Morgan Stanley Japan Securities Co., Ltd., into MUMSS (MSMS, together with MUMSS, the Joint Venture). MSMS will continue its sales and trading and capital markets business conducted in Japan. Following the respective contributions to the Joint Venture and a cash payment of 23 billion yen ($247 million) from MUFG to the Company, the Company owns a 40% economic interest in the Joint Venture, and MUFG owns a 60% economic interest in the Joint Venture. The Company holds a 40% voting interest and MUFG holds a 60% voting interest in MUMSS, while the Company holds a 51% voting interest and MUFG holds a 49% voting interest in MSMS. The Company continues to consolidate MSMS in its consolidated financial statements and, commencing on May 1, 2010, accounted for its interest in MUMSS 76 Table of Contents as an equity method investment within the Institutional Securities business segment. During 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded losses of $783 million and $62 million, respectively, within Other revenues in the consolidated statements of income, arising from the Companys 40% stake in MUMSS. In order to enhance the risk management at MUMSS, during 2011, the Company entered into a transaction with MUMSS whereby the risk associated with the fixed income trading positions that previously caused the majority of the aforementioned MUMSS losses in 2011 was transferred to MSMS (see Executive Summary Significant Items Japanese Securities Joint Venture herein for more information). In return for entering into the transaction, the Company received total consideration of $659 million, which represented the estimated fair value of the fixed income trading positions transferred. To the extent that losses incurred by MUMSS result in a requirement to restore its capital, MUFG is solely responsible for providing this additional capital to a minimum level and the Company is not obligated to contribute additional capital to MUMSS. Because of the losses incurred by MUMSS, MUFG contributed approximately $370 million and $259 million of capital to MUMSS on April 22, 2011 and November 24, 2011, respectively. The MUFG capital injection improved the capital base and restored the capital adequacy ratio of MUMSS in each case. As a result of the capital injections, during 2011, the Company recorded increases of approximately $251 million in the carrying amount of the equity method investment in MUMSS, reflecting the Companys 40% share of the increases in the net asset value of MUMSS, and increases in the Companys Paid in capital of approximately $146 million (after tax). To the extent that MUMSS is required to increase its capital level due to factors other than losses, such as changes in regulatory requirements, both MUFG and the Company are required to contribute the necessary capital based upon their economic interest as set forth above. In this context, the Company contributed $129 million and MUFG contributed $195 million of additional proportionate capital investments on November 24, 2011 to meet an anticipated change in regulatory capital requirements of MUMSS. At December 31, 2011, the Company performed an impairment review of its equity method investment in MUMSS in view of the deterioration in the financial performance of MUMSS and the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan on March 11, 2011. The Company recorded no other than temporary impairment loss in 2011. Adverse market or economic events, as well as further deterioration of economic performance, could result in impairment charges of this investment in future periods. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements and Executive Summary Significant Items Japanese Securities Joint Venture herein for further information. Redemption of CIC Equity Units and Issuance of Common Stock. In December 2007, the Company sold Equity Units that included contracts to purchase Company common stock to a wholly owned subsidiary of CIC. The Company redeemed the junior subordinated debentures underlying the Equity Units in August 2010, and the redemption proceeds were subsequently used by the CIC subsidiary to settle its obligation under the purchase contracts. Dividend Income. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company reclassified dividend income associated with trading and investing activities to Principal transactions Trading or Principal transactions Investments depending upon the business activity. Previously, these amounts were included in Interest and dividends on the consolidated statements of income. These reclassifications were made in connection with the Companys conversion to a financial holding company. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. 77 Table of Contents Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. Expense. The Company recognizes the compensation cost of an employees pension benefits (including prior service cost) over the employees estimated service period. This process involves making certain estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. On June 1, 2010, the defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the U.S. Qualified Plan) was amended to cease future benefit accruals after December 31, 2010. Any benefits earned by participants under the U.S. Qualified Plan at December 31, 2010 were preserved and will be payable based on the U.S. Qualified Plans provisions. Net periodic pension expense for U.S. and non U.S. plans was $72 million, $96 million and $175 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On October 29, 2010, the Morgan Stanley Medical Plan was amended to change eligibility requirements for a firm provided subsidy toward the cost of retiree medical coverage after December 31, 2010. Net periodic postretirement expense for the Morgan Stanley Medical Plan was $12 million and $26 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contributions. The Company made contributions of $57 million, $72 million and $321 million to its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These contributions were funded with cash from operations. The Company determines the amount of its pension contributions to its funded plans by considering several factors, including the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, the types of assets in which the plans are invested, expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements. The Companys policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws (for example, in the U.S., the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA). At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, there were no minimum required ERISA contributions for the U.S. Qualified Plan. No contributions were made to the U.S. Qualified Plan for 2011 and 2010. A $278 million contribution was funded to the U.S. Qualified Plan for 2009 based on the service cost earned by the eligible employees plus a portion of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation on a funding basis. Liabilities for benefits payable under certain postretirement and unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the Company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Regulatory Outlook. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Act into law. While certain portions of the Dodd Frank Act were effective immediately, other portions will be effective only following extended transition periods. Moreover, implementation of the Dodd Frank Act will be accomplished through numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies, only a portion of which has been completed. It remains difficult to assess fully the impact that the Dodd Frank Act will have on the Company and on the financial services industry generally. In addition, various international developments, such as the adoption of risk based capital, leverage and liquidity standards by the Basel Committee, known as Basel III, will impact the Company in the coming years. It is likely that 2012 and subsequent years will see further material changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which the Company operates, although it remains difficult to predict which further reform initiatives will become law, how such reforms will be implemented or the exact impact they will have on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period. See also Business Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1. 78 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies. The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Fair Value. Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value. A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value. The Company makes estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include but are not limited to: Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased; Securities available for sale; Securities received as collateral and Obligation to return securities received as collateral; Certain Commercial paper and other short term borrowings, primarily structured notes; Certain Deposits; Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; Certain Other secured financings; and Certain Long term borrowings, primarily structured notes. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 uses observable prices in active markets, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, see Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. The Companys Level 3 assets before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $32.5 billion and $34.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and represented approximately 10% at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, of the assets measured at fair value (4% of total assets at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010). Level 3 liabilities before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting across the levels of the fair value hierarchy were $11.2 billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and represented approximately 6% and 4%, respectively, of the Companys liabilities measured at fair value. Transfers In/Out of Level 3 During 2011. During 2011, the Company reclassified approximately $1.8 billion of certain Corporate and other debt, primarily corporate loans, from Level 3 to Level 2. The Company reclassified the corporate loans as external prices and or spread inputs for these instruments became observable. 79 Table of Contents The Company also reclassified approximately $0.8 billion of certain Corporate and other debt from Level 2 to Level 3. The reclassifications were primarily related to corporate loans and were generally due to a reduction in market price quotations for these or comparable instruments, or a lack of available broker quotes, such that unobservable inputs had to be utilized for the fair value measurement of these instruments. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non recurring Basis. At December 31, 2011, certain of the Companys assets were measured at fair value on a non recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs, and intangible assets. The Company incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods. For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items. For further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Control Processes. The Company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. These control processes include reviews of the pricing models theoretical soundness and appropriateness by Company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks, which include Finance, Market Risk Department and Credit Risk Management Department. These groups participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models, as appropriate. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model. Consistent with market practice, the Company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral (margining) based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed. Through this margining process, one party or each party to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required. This sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the Companys recorded fair value for the relevant OTC derivative products. For certain OTC derivative products, the Company, along with other market participants, contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the information and make it accessible to subscribers. This information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these OTC derivative products. For more information regarding the Companys risk management practices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all of the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required 80 Table of Contents to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the Company believes market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair values are generally determined utilizing methodologies that incorporate price to book, price to earnings and assets under management multiples of certain comparable companies. The Company also utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology for certain reporting units. Intangible Assets. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently when certain events or circumstances exist) for impairment. For indefinite lived intangible assets, an impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods. See Notes 4 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. Legal, Regulatory and Tax Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress. The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the Companys business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case by case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Company accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. For certain legal proceedings, the Company can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings, the Company cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek substantial or indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially 81 Table of Contents lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. The Company is subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting for unrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. The income of certain foreign subsidiaries earned outside of the United States has been excluded from taxation in the U.S. as a result of a provision of U.S. tax law that defers the imposition of tax on certain active financial services income until such income is repatriated to the United States as a dividend. This provision, which expired for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012, had previously been extended by Congress on several occasions, including the most recent extension which occurred during 2010. If this provision is not extended, the overall financial impact to the Company would depend upon the level, composition and geographic mix of future earnings but could increase the Companys 2012 annual effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on the Companys net income, but not its cash flows due to utilization of tax attributes carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. See Notes 13 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings and tax examinations. Special Purpose Entities and Variable Interest Entities. The Companys involvement with special purpose entities (SPE) consists primarily of the following: Transferring financial assets into SPEs; Acting as an underwriter of beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles; Holding one or more classes of securities issued by, or making loans to or investments in, SPEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets; Purchasing and selling (in both a market making and a proprietary trading capacity) securities issued by SPEs/variable interest entities (VIE), whether such vehicles are sponsored by the Company or not; Entering into derivative transactions with SPEs (whether or not sponsored by the Company); Providing warehouse financing to collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations; Entering into derivative agreements with non SPEs whose value is derived from securities issued by SPEs; Servicing assets held by SPEs or holding servicing rights related to assets held by SPEs that are serviced by others under subservicing arrangements; Serving as an asset manager to various investment funds that may invest in securities that are backed, in whole or in part, by SPEs; and 82 Table of Contents Structuring and or investing in other structured transactions designed to provide enhanced, tax efficient yields to the Company or its clients. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial instruments. The Companys involvement with SPEs is discussed further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, these SPEs are deemed for accounting purposes to be VIEs. The Company applies accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Entities that previously met the criteria as qualifying SPEs that were not subject to consolidation prior to January 1, 2010 became subject to the consolidation requirements for VIEs on that date. Excluding entities subject to the Deferral (as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), effective January 1, 2010, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that both (1) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIEs economic performance and (2) has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company consolidates entities of which it is the primary beneficiary. The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial involvement with the VIE and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the VIE, including the VIEs structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the Company and by other parties and the variable interests owned by the Company and other parties. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2010 for transfers of financial assets. 83 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Companys senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of the Company. Through various risk and control committees, the Companys senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the Companys asset and liability position. The Companys Treasury Department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset and Liability Management Committee and other control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Companys business activities have on its consolidated statements of financial condition, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Boards Risk Committee. The Balance Sheet. The Company actively monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in managing the size of its balance sheet. The Companys total assets decreased to $749,898 million at December 31, 2011 from $807,698 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to a decrease in Financial instruments owned Corporate equities and Corporate and other debt and Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to sell and Securities borrowed. The Companys assets and liabilities are primarily related to transactions attributable to sales and trading and securities financing activities. At December 31, 2011, securities financing assets and liabilities were $332 billion and $268 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2010, securities financing assets and liabilities were $358 billion and $321 billion, respectively. Securities financing transactions include repurchase and resale agreements, securities borrowed and loaned transactions, securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received. Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned were $135 billion at December 31, 2011 and averaged $180 billion during 2011. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed were $257 billion at December 31, 2011 and averaged $303 billion during 2011. In both cases, the period end balance was lower than the average balances for 2011 primarily, due to a decrease in the overall balance sheet during the year. Securities financing assets and liabilities also include matched book transactions with minimal market, credit and or liquidity risk. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer owned securities, and customer cash, which is segregated according to regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer payables to the Companys prime brokerage clients. The Companys risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit the Companys credit exposure to customers. Included within securities financing assets were $12 billion and $17 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, recorded in accordance with accounting guidance for the transfer of financial assets that represented offsetting assets and liabilities for fully collateralized non cash loan transactions. 84 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the Companys tangible common equity at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and average balances during 2011: Balance at Average Balance(1) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 2011 (dollars in millions) Common equity $ 60,541 $ 47,614 $ 54,382 Preferred equity 1,508 9,597 5,241 Morgan Stanley shareholders equity 62,049 57,211 59,623 Junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts 4,853 4,817 4,835 Less: Goodwill and net intangible assets(2) (6,691 ) (6,947 ) (6,836 ) Tangible Morgan Stanley shareholders equity $ 60,211 $ 55,081 $ 57,622 Common equity $ 60,541 $ 47,614 $ 54,382 Less: Goodwill and net intangible assets(2) (6,691 ) (6,947 ) (6,836 ) Tangible common equity(3) $ 53,850 $ 40,667 $ 47,546 (1) The Company calculates its average balances based upon month end balances. (2) The goodwill and net intangible assets deduction exclude mortgage servicing rights (net of disallowable mortgage servicing rights) of $120 million and $141 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and include only the Companys share of MSSBs goodwill and intangible assets. (3) Tangible common equity, a non GAAP financial measure, equals common equity less goodwill and net intangible assets as defined above. The Company views tangible common equity as a useful measure to investors because it is a commonly utilized metric and reflects the common equity deployed in the Companys businesses. Balance Sheet and Funding Activity in 2011. During 2011, the Company issued notes with a principal amount of approximately $33 billion. In connection with the note issuances, the Company generally enters into certain transactions to obtain floating interest rates based primarily on short term LIBOR trading levels. The weighted average maturity of the Companys long term borrowings, based upon stated maturity dates, was approximately 5 years at December 31, 2011. During 2011, approximately $39 billion in aggregate long term borrowings were matured or retired. Subsequent to December 31, 2011 and through February 10, 2012, the Companys long term borrowings (net of issuances) decreased by approximately $6.8 billion. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate outstanding carrying amount of the Companys senior indebtedness was approximately $176 billion (including guaranteed obligations of the indebtedness of subsidiaries) compared with $183 billion at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the amount of senior indebtedness was primarily due to repayments of notes, net of new issuances in long term and short term borrowings. MUFG Stock Conversion. On June 30, 2011, MUFGs outstanding Series B Preferred Stock was converted into the Companys common stock (see Executive Summary Significant Items MUFG Stock Conversion herein). Capital Management. The Companys senior management views capital as an important source of financial strength. The Company actively manages its consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract its capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses. The Company attempts to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity. 85 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $1.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program out of the $6 billion authorized by the Board of Directors in December 2006. The share repurchase program is for capital management purposes and considers, among other things, business segment capital needs as well as equity based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases by the Company are subject to regulatory approval. During 2011, the Company did not repurchase common stock as part of its capital management share repurchase program (see also Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5). The Board of Directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. In January 2012, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.05. In December 2011, the Company also announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $255.56 per share of Series A Floating Rate Non Cumulative Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.25556) and a quarterly dividend of $25.00 per share of Series C Non Cumulative Non Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock. Required Capital. Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2010, the Companys capital estimation is based on the Required Capital Framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. This framework is a risk based internal use of capital measure, which is compared with the Companys regulatory capital to help ensure the Company maintains an amount of risk based going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from extreme stress events at a point in time. The difference between the Companys regulatory capital and aggregate Required Capital is the Companys Parent capital. Average Tier 1 capital, aggregate Required capital and Parent capital for 2011 were approximately $51.2 billion, $30.9 billion and $20.3 billion, respectively. The Company generally holds Parent capital for prospective regulatory requirements, including Basel III, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs. Tier 1 capital and common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by Required Capital. In principle, each business segment is capitalized as if it were an independent operating entity with limited diversification benefit between the business segments. Required Capital is assessed at each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk adjusted basis. The Required Capital Framework will evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment and to incorporate enhancements in modeling techniques. During 2012, the Company will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate. For a further discussion of the Companys Tier 1 capital, see Regulatory Requirements herein. The following table presents the Companys and business segments average Tier 1 capital and average common equity for 2011 and 2010. 2011 2010 AverageTier 1Capital AverageCommonEquity AverageTier 1Capital AverageCommonEquity (dollars in billions) Institutional Securities $ 26.2 $ 26.2 $ 26.0 $ 17.7 Global Wealth Management Group 3.3 7.6 2.9 6.8 Asset Management 1.4 2.2 1.9 2.1 Parent capital 20.3 18.4 20.7 15.5 Total from continuing operations 51.2 54.4 51.5 42.1 Discontinued operations 0.1 0.3 Total $ 51.2 $ 54.4 $ 51.6 $ 42.4 86 Table of Contents Capital Covenants. In October 2006 and April 2007, the Company executed replacement capital covenants in connection with offerings by Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VII and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII (the Capital Securities), which become effective after the scheduled redemption date in 2046. Under the terms of the replacement capital covenants, the Company has agreed, for the benefit of certain specified holders of debt, to limitations on its ability to redeem or repurchase any of the Capital Securities for specified periods of time. For a complete description of the Capital Securities and the terms of the replacement capital covenants, see the Companys Current Reports on Form 8 K dated October 12, 2006 and April 26, 2007. Liquidity Risk Management Framework. The primary goal of the Companys liquidity risk management framework is to ensure that the Company has access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions. The framework is designed to enable the Company to fulfill its financial obligations and support the execution of the Companys business strategies. The following principles guide the Companys liquidity risk management framework: Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities; Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short term funding; Source, counterparty, currency, region, and term of funding should be diversified; and Limited access to funding should be anticipated through the Contingency Funding Plan. The core components of the Companys liquidity risk management framework are the Contingency Funding Plan (CFP), Liquidity Stress Tests and the Global Liquidity Reserve. These elements support the Companys target liquidity profile. Contingency Funding Plan. The Company maintains the CFP, which describes the data and information flows, limits and triggers, escalation procedures, roles and responsibilities, and available mitigating actions in the event of a liquidity stress. The CFP assesses current and future funding sources and uses and establishes a plan for monitoring and managing a potential liquidity stress event. A set of escalation triggers identifies early signs of stress and activates a response plan. Liquidity Stress Tests. The Company uses Liquidity Stress Tests to model liquidity outflows across multiple scenarios over a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events. The assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests include, but are not limited to, the following: No government support; No access to equity and unsecured debt markets; Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year; Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding; Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties and certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to multi notch credit rating downgrade; Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral; 87 Table of Contents Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks; Drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties; Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions; Limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets; Return of securities borrowed on an uncollateralized basis; and Maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance. The Liquidity Stress Tests are produced at the Parent company (Parent) and major operating subsidiary levels, as well as at major currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Company. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent. The Parent will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves that are subject to any regulatory, legal or tax constraints. At December 31, 2011, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in its Liquidity Stress Tests. Global Liquidity Reserve. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity reserves (Global Liquidity Reserve) to cover daily funding needs and meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the CFP and Liquidity Stress Tests. These liquidity targets are based on the Companys risk tolerance, balance sheet level and composition, subsidiary funding needs, and upcoming debt maturities, which are subject to change dependent on market and firm specific events. The Global Liquidity Reserve is held within the Parent and operating subsidiaries. The Global Liquidity Reserve is comprised of highly liquid and diversified cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered securities. Eligible unencumbered securities include U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage backed securities, FDIC guaranteed corporate debt and non U.S. government securities. Global Liquidity Reserve by Type of Investment. The table below summarizes the Companys Global Liquidity Reserve by type of investment: At December 31,2011 (dollars in billions) Cash deposits with banks $ 9 Cash deposits with central banks 31 Unencumbered highly liquid securities: U.S. Government obligations 80 U.S. agency and agency mortgage backed securities 36 Non U.S. sovereign obligations(1) 14 Investments in money market funds 1 Other investment grade securities 11 Global Liquidity Reserve $ 182 (1) At December 31, 2011, approximately 93% of Non U.S sovereign obligations were rated AAA. The ability to monetize assets during the start of a liquidity crisis is critical. The Company believes that the assets held in the Global Liquidity Reserve can be monetized within five business days in a stressed environment given the highly liquid and diversified nature of the reserves. 88 Table of Contents The currency profile of the Global Liquidity Reserve is consistent with the CFP and Liquidity Stress Tests. In addition to the Global Liquidity Reserve, the Company has other cash and cash equivalents and other unencumbered assets that are available for monetization which are not included in the balances in the table above. Global Liquidity Reserve Held by the Parent and Operating Subsidiaries. The table below summarizes the Global Liquidity Reserve held by the Parent and operating subsidiaries: AtDecember 31,2011 Average Balance(1)2011 (dollars in billions) Parent $ 75 $ 78 Non Bank Subsidiaries: Domestic 18 12 Foreign 26 23 Total Non Bank Subsidiaries 44 35 Bank Subsidiaries: Domestic 56 57 Foreign 7 7 Total Bank Subsidiaries 63 64 Total $ 182 $ 177 (1) The Company calculates the average Global Liquidity Reserve based upon daily amounts. The Company is exposed to intra day settlement risk in connection with liquidity provided to its major broker dealer subsidiaries for intra day clearing and settlement of its securities and financing activity. As mentioned in Contingency Funding Plan, the CFP assumes that the Parent will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves that are subject to any regulatory, legal or tax constraints. Funding Management. The Companys funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the Companys operations. The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, by investor and by region) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Companys liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. The Company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include the Companys equity capital, long term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, commercial paper, letters of credit and lines of credit. The Company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. Secured Financing. A substantial portion of the Companys total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short term collateralized receivables arising principally from its Institutional Securities business segments sales and trading activities. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company with flexibility in financing these assets with collateralized borrowings. 89 Table of Contents The Companys goal is to achieve an optimal mix of secured and unsecured funding while ensuring continued growth in stable funding sources. The Institutional Securities business segment emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding, which is generally more subject to disruption during periods of financial stress. The ability to fund less liquid assets on a secured basis may be impaired in a stress environment. To manage this risk, the Company obtains longer term secured financing for less liquid assets and has minimal reliance on overnight financing. At December 31, 2011, the weighted average maturity of the Companys secured financing against less liquid collateral was greater than 120 days. The Company defines less liquid collateral as that which is not consistent with the standards of the Global Liquidity Reserve. In addition, the Company minimizes refinancing risk by diversifying across both counterparties and maturities. The Company holds a portion of its Global Liquidity Reserve against a potential disruption to its secured financing capabilities. This potential disruption may be in the form of additional margin or reduced capacity to refinance maturing trades. The Company actively manages its secured financing book in accordance with established limits on tenor by asset class and seeks to build a sufficient buffer to offset various risks discussed above. Unsecured Financing. The Company views long term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding for core inventories and less liquid assets. Securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding, deposits, floating rate long term debt and fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate. The Company uses derivative products (primarily interest rate, currency and equity swaps) to assist in asset and liability management and to hedge interest rate risk (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). In October 2008, the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury invoked the systemic risk exception of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, and the FDIC announced the TLGP. Based on the Final Rule adopted on November 21, 2008, the TLGP provides a guarantee, through the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012, of certain senior unsecured debt issued by participating Eligible Entities (including the Company) between October 14, 2008 and June 30, 2009. Of the $23.8 billion issued by the Company under the TLGP, $12.1 billion was still outstanding at December 31, 2011. Short Term Borrowings. The Companys unsecured short term borrowings consist of commercial paper, bank loans, bank notes and structured notes with maturities of 12 months or less at issuance. The table below summarizes the Companys short term unsecured borrowings: AtDecember 31,2011 AtDecember 31,2010 (dollars in millions) Commercial paper(1) $ 978 $ 945 Other short term borrowings 1,865 2,311 Total $ 2,843 $ 3,256 (1) At December 31, 2011, the majority of the commercial paper balance was issued as part of client transactions and is not used for the Companys general funding purposes. Deposits. The Companys bank subsidiaries funding sources include bank deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, certificates of deposit, money market deposit accounts, commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The vast majority of deposits in Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (the Subsidiary Banks) are sourced from the Companys retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable, low cost funding characteristics. 90 Table of Contents Deposits were as follows: AtDecember 31,2011(1) AtDecember 31,2010(1) (dollars in millions) Savings and demand deposits(2) $ 63,029 $ 59,856 Time deposits(3) 2,633 3,956 Total $ 65,662 $ 63,812 (1) Total deposits subject to FDIC Insurance at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 were $52 billion and $48 billion, respectively. (2) Amounts include non interest bearing deposits of $1,270 million and $30 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (3) Certain time deposit accounts are carried at fair value under the fair value option (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). With the passage of the Dodd Frank Act, the statutory standard maximum deposit insurance amount was permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor and is in effect for the Subsidiary Banks. Long Term Borrowings. The Company uses a variety of long term debt funding sources to generate liquidity, taking CFP requirements into consideration. In addition, the issuance of long term debt allows the Company to reduce reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments (e.g., commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings). Long term borrowings are generally structured to ensure staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients. Availability and cost of financing to the Company can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, the Companys credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. The Company may from time to time engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt retirements) that it believes are in the best interests of the Company and its investors. Long term borrowings at December 31, 2011 consisted of the following: Parent Subsidiaries Total (dollars in millions) Due in 2012 $ 33,811 $ 1,271 $ 35,082 Due in 2013 24,464 554 25,018 Due in 2014 20,493 991 21,484 Due in 2015 17,914 3,974 21,888 Due in 2016 17,557 1,470 19,027 Thereafter 60,522 1,213 61,735 Total $ 174,761 $ 9,473 $ 184,234 Credit Ratings. The Company relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally is impacted by the Companys credit ratings. In addition, the Companys credit ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Issuer specific factors that are important to the determination of the Companys credit ratings include governance, the level and quality of earnings, capital adequacy, funding and liquidity, risk appetite and management, asset quality, strategic direction and business mix. Additionally, the agencies will look at other industry wide factors such as regulatory or legislative changes, macro economic environment, and perceived levels of government support. 91 Table of Contents The rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of uplift from perceived government support in the credit ratings of systemically important banks, including the credit ratings of the Company. Rating agencies continue to monitor progress of U.S. financial reform legislation to assess whether the possibility of extraordinary government support for the financial system in any future financial crises is negatively impacted. Legislative outcomes may lead to reduced uplift assumptions for U.S. banks and thereby place downward pressure on credit ratings. At the same time, proposed U.S. financial reform legislation also has positive implications for credit ratings such as higher standards for capital and liquidity levels. The net result on credit ratings and the timing of any change in rating agency assumptions on support is currently uncertain. At February 17, 2012, the Companys and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.s senior unsecured ratings were as set forth below. The long term credit ratings on the Company by Moodys Investor Services, Inc (Moodys) and Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) are currently at different levels (commonly referred to as split ratings).

A Stable Outlook was assigned. (2) On February 15, 2012, Moodys placed the ratings of 17 banks on review for downgrade in the context of a broad review of global banks with capital markets operations. As part of this review, Moodys placed the Companys and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.As A2/A1 long term and P 1 short term ratings on review for downgrade. (3) On November 29, 2011, Standard & Poors released new bank ratings for the top global banks based upon its revised methodology. The Companys long and short term debt ratings were lowered one notch from A/A 1 to A /A 2 and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.As long term debt rating was lowered from A+ to A. Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.s short term debt rating was affirmed at A 1. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, the Company may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade. The following are the amounts of additional collateral or termination payments that could be called by counterparties under the terms of such agreements in the event of a downgrade of the Companys long term credit rating under various scenarios at December 31, 2011: $919 million (A3 Moodys/A S&P); $3,989 million (Baa1 Moodys/ BBB+ S&P); and $4,743 million (Baa2 Moodys/BBB S&P). Also, the Company is required to pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. At December 31, 2011, the increased collateral requirement at certain exchanges and clearing organizations under various scenarios was $118 million (A3 Moodys/A S&P); $1,183 million (Baa1 Moodys/ BBB+ S&P); and $1,775 million (Baa2 Moodys/BBB S&P). The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is accounted for in the Companys CFP. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements with Unconsolidated Entities. The Company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including VIEs, primarily in connection with its Institutional Securities business segment. Institutional Securities Activities. The Company utilizes SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. The Company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency 92 Table of Contents collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and other types of financial assets. The Company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Retained interests in securitized financial assets were approximately $2.9 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, substantially all of which were related to U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage loan and residential mortgage loan securitization transactions. For further information about the Companys securitization activities, see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has entered into liquidity facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. The Company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). Asset Management Activities. As a general partner in certain private equity and real estate partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations. Guarantees. Accounting guidance for guarantees requires the Company to disclose information about its obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. Guarantees are defined as contracts and indemnification agreements that contingently require a guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, a security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Guarantees are also defined as contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.

The remainder of these lending commitments are carried at fair value. (3) These commitments are recorded at fair value within Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated statements of financial condition (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). (4) The Company enters into forward starting reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements (agreements that have a trade date at or prior to December 31, 2011 and settle subsequent to period end) that are primarily secured by collateral from U.S. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations. These agreements primarily settle within three business days and of the amount at December 31, 2011, $36.4 billion settled within three business days. For further description of these commitments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein. 94 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations include long term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases, purchase obligations and expected contributions for pension and postretirement plans. The Companys future cash payments associated with certain of its obligations at December 31, 2011 are summarized below: Payments Due in: At December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (dollars in millions) Long term borrowings(1) $ 35,082 $ 46,502 $ 40,915 $ 61,735 $ 184,234 Other secured financings(1) 8,361 6,114 1,478 2,743 18,696 Contractual interest payments(2) 6,418 10,830 7,936 21,659 46,843 Contractual interest payments on time deposits(3) 1,228 1,493 2,721 Operating leases office facilities(4) 693 1,229 876 2,453 5,251 Operating leases equipment(4) 210 429 158 162 959 Purchase obligations(5) 814 621 270 54 1,759 Pension and postretirement plans expected contribution(6) 50 50 Total(7) $ 52,856 $ 67,218 $ 51,633 $ 88,806 $ 260,513 (1) See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented for Other secured financings are financings with original maturities greater than one year. (2) Amounts represent estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured long term borrowings based on applicable interest rates at December 31, 2011. Amounts include stated coupon rates, if any, on structured or index linked notes. (3) Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments related to time deposits primarily held at the Subsidiary Banks. (4) See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, printing, computer and telecommunications maintenance agreements, certain license agreements related to MSSB, and certain transmission, transportation and storage contracts related to the commodities business.

(7) Amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable at this time (see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information). Regulatory Requirements. Capital. The Company is a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company, including well capitalized standards, and evaluates the Companys compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Companys national bank subsidiaries (see Other Matters Regulatory Outlook herein). The Company calculates its capital ratios and risk weighted assets (RWA) in accordance with the capital adequacy standards for financial holding companies adopted by the Federal Reserve. These standards are based upon a framework described in the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, July 1988, as amended, also referred to as Basel I. In December 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published final regulations incorporating the Basel II Accord, which requires internationally active banking organizations, as well as certain of their U.S. bank subsidiaries, to implement Basel II standards over the next several years. In July 2010, the Company began reporting its capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to its regulators under Basel I and Basel II as part of a phased implementation of Basel II. 95 Table of Contents In June 2011, the U.S. banking regulators published final regulations implementing a provision of the Dodd Frank Act requiring certain institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, including the Company, be subject to capital requirements that are not less than the generally applicable risk based capital requirements. As a result, the generally applicable capital standards, which are based on Basel I standards, but may themselves change over time, will serve as a permanent floor to minimum capital requirements calculated under the Basel II standards the Company is currently required to implement, as well as future capital standards. Basel III contains new capital standards that raise the quality of capital and strengthen counterparty credit risk capital requirements and introduce a leverage ratio as a supplemental measure to the risk based ratio. Basel III includes a new capital conservation buffer, which imposes a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress, subject to restrictions on capital actions, a new additional loss absorbency capital requirement for global systemically important banks (GSIB) such as the Company, and a new countercyclical buffer which regulators can activate during periods of excessive credit growth in their jurisdiction. The Basel III proposals complement an earlier proposal for revisions to the market risk framework that increases capital requirements for securitizations within the Companys trading book. In 2011, the U.S. regulators issued proposed rules that are intended to implement certain aspects of the market risk framework proposals. The U.S. regulators will require implementation of Basel III subject to an extended phase in period. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve issued final rules on Capital Plans, which require large bank holding companies such as the Company to submit capital plans on an annual basis in order for the Federal Reserve to assess the companies systems and processes that incorporate forward looking projections of revenue and losses to monitor and maintain their internal capital adequacy. The rules also require that such companies to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before making a capital action. Under the Basel Committees proposed framework, based on a preliminary analysis of the guidelines published to date and other factors, the Company estimates its pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III will be in a range between 8% and 10% by the end of 2012. These are preliminary estimates and may change based on guidelines for implementation to be issued by the Federal Reserve. These preliminary estimates are forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the Company, please see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A herein. In accordance with the Federal Reserves new Capital Plans final rule, Tier 1 common capital is calculated as Tier 1 capital less non common elements in Tier 1 capital. Non common elements include perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interests in subsidiaries, trust preferred securities and mandatory convertible preferred securities. The Federal Reserve will work with the other federal banking agencies to implement Basel III and to propose a Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio as a new minimum regulatory capital ratio. The existing supervisory definition of Tier 1 common capital will remain in force under the Capital Plans final rule until the Federal Reserve adopts the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. Pursuant to provisions of the Dodd Frank Act, over time, trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital but will only qualify as Tier 2 capital. This change in regulatory capital treatment will be phased in incrementally during a transition period that will start on January 1, 2013 and end on January 1, 2016. This provision of the Dodd Frank Act accelerates the phasing in of the disqualification of the trust preferred securities as provided for by Basel III. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with Basel I capital requirements with ratios of Tier 1 capital to RWAs of 16.6% and total capital to RWAs of 17.8% (6% and 10% being well capitalized for regulatory purposes, respectively). Also, the ratio of Tier 1 common capital to RWAs was 13.0% (5% being the minimum under the Federal Reserves new capital plan framework). In addition, financial holding companies are also subject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve. The Company calculated its Tier 1 leverage ratio as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets (which reflects adjustments for disallowed 96 Table of Contents goodwill, certain intangible assets, deferred tax assets and financial and non financial equity investments). The adjusted average total assets are derived using weekly balances for the year. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with this leverage restriction, with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.8% (5% being well capitalized for regulatory purposes). The following table reconciles the Companys total shareholders equity to Tier 1 common, Tier 1, Tier 2 and Total allowable capital as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and presents the Companys consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: AtDecember 31,2011 AtDecember 31,2010 (dollars in millions) Allowable capital Common shareholders equity $ 60,541 $ 47,614 Less: Goodwill (6,686 ) (6,739 ) Less: Non servicing intangible assets (4,165 ) (4,526 ) Less: Net deferred tax assets (4,860 ) (3,984 ) Less: After tax debt valuation adjustment (2,296 ) (20 ) Other deductions (1,511 ) (1,986 ) MSSB Goodwill/Intangibles Apportionment 4,317 Tier 1 common capital(2) 41,023 34,676 Qualifying preferred stock 1,508 9,597 Qualifying restricted core capital elements 9,821 12,924 Less: MSSB Goodwill/Intangibles Apportionment (4,317 ) Tier 1 capital 52,352 52,880 Qualifying subordinated debt and restricted core capital elements 4,546 2,412 Other qualifying amounts 17 82 Other deductions (721 ) (897 ) Tier 2 capital 3,842 1,597 Total allowable capital $ 56,194 $ 54,477 Total risk weighted assets(1) $ 315,293 $ 340,884 Capital ratios Total capital ratio(1) 17.8 % 16.0 % Tier 1 common capital ratio(1)(2) 13.0 % 10.2 % Tier 1 capital ratio(1) 16.6 % 15.5 % Tier 1 leverage ratio 6.8 % 6.6 % (1) At December 31, 2010, the Companys RWAs, Total capital ratio, Tier 1 common capital ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio were adjusted to $340,884 million, 16.0%, 10.2% and 15.5%, respectively, from $329,560 million, 16.5%, 10.5% and 16.1%, respectively, based on revised guidance from the Federal Reserve about the Companys capital treatment for OTC derivatives collateral. (2) Tier 1 common capital ratio equals Tier 1 common capital divided by RWA. On December 30, 2011, the Federal Reserve formalized regulatory definitions for Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 common capital ratio. The Federal Reserve defined Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital less non common elements in Tier 1 capital, including perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interest in subsidiaries, trust preferred securities and mandatory convertible preferred securities. Previously, the Companys definition of Tier 1 common capital included all of the items noted in the Federal Reserves definition, but it also included an adjustment for the portion of goodwill and non servicing intangible assets associated with MSSBs noncontrolling interests (i.e., Citis share of MSSBs goodwill and intangibles). The Companys conformance to the Federal Reserves definition under the final rule reduced its Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 common ratio by approximately $4.2 billion and 132 basis points, respectively at December 31, 2011. 97 Table of Contents Total allowable capital is composed of Tier 1 capital, which includes Tier 1 common capital, and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less non common elements in Tier 1 capital, including qualifying perpetual stock and qualifying restricted core capital elements, as per the Capital Plans final rule. Tier 1 capital consists predominately of common shareholders equity as well as qualifying preferred stock and qualifying restricted core capital elements (trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests) less goodwill, non servicing intangible assets (excluding allowable mortgage servicing rights), net deferred tax assets (recoverable in excess of one year), an after tax debt valuation adjustment and certain other deductions, including equity investments. The debt valuation adjustment in the above table represents the cumulative change in fair value of certain long term and short term borrowings that was attributable to the Companys own instrument specific credit spreads and is included in retained earnings. For a further discussion of fair value, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2011, the Company calculated its RWAs in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements of the Federal Reserve, which is consistent with guidelines described under Basel I. RWAs reflect both on and off balance sheet risk of the Company. The risk capital calculations will evolve over time as the Company enhances its risk management methodology and incorporates improvements in modeling techniques while maintaining compliance with the regulatory requirements and interpretations. Market RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and other factors. For a further discussion of the Companys market risks and Value at Risk (VaR) model, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management in Part II, Item 7A herein. Market RWAs incorporate two components: systematic risk and specific risk. Systematic and specific risk charges are computed using either the Companys VaR model or Standardized Approach in accordance with regulatory requirements. Credit RWAs reflect capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its financial obligations. For a further discussion of the Companys credit risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Risk Management Credit Risk in Part II, Item 7A herein. Liquidity. The Basel Committee has developed two standards for supervisors to use in liquidity risk supervision. The first standards objective is to promote the short term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks and bank holding companies. The Basel Committee developed the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets to cover net outflows arising from significant stress lasting 30 calendar days. The standard requires that the value of the ratio be no lower than 100%. The second standards objective is to promote resilience over a longer time horizon. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) has a time horizon of one year and builds on traditional net liquid asset and cash capital methodologies used widely by internationally active banking organizations to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. The NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding to the amount of required stable funding. This ratio must be greater than 100%. After an observation period beginning in 2011, the LCR, including any revisions, will be introduced on January 1, 2015. The NSFR, including any revisions, will move to a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. The Company will continue to monitor the development and the potential impact of these standards. In addition, in December 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement certain requirements of the systemic risk regime, including with respect to liquidity. The proposed rules would require systemically important financial institutions, such as the Company, to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30 day liquidity stress event, to conduct regular liquidity stress tests, and to implement various liquidity risk management requirements. 98 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation and Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. The Companys assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and, therefore, are not significantly affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the Companys financial position and profitability. A significant portion of the Companys business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the Companys financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. 99 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Risk Management. Overview. Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of the Companys business activities. Accordingly, the Company employs an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework to integrate the diverse roles of the risk departments into a holistic enterprise structure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk evaluation into decision making processes across the Company. The Company has policies and procedures in place to identify, assess, monitor and manage the significant risks involved in the activities of its Institutional Securities, Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management business segments as well as at the holding company level. Principal risks involved in the Companys business activities include market, credit, capital and liquidity, operational, legal and regulatory risk. The cornerstone of the Companys risk management philosophy is the execution of risk adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects the Companys capital base and franchise. Five key principles underlie this philosophy: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. The fast paced, complex, and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires that the Company maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of the Companys reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. Risk Governance Structure. Risk management at the Company requires independent company level oversight, accountability of the Companys business segments, and effective communication of risk matters to senior management and across the Company. The nature of the Companys risks, coupled with its risk management philosophy, informs the Companys risk governance structure. The Companys risk governance structure is comprised of the Board of Directors; the Risk Committee of the Board (BRC), the Audit Committee of the Board (BAC), and the Operations and Technology Committee of the Board (BOTC); the Firm Risk Committee (FRC); senior management oversight (including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer); the Internal Audit Department and risk managers, committees, and groups within and across the Companys business segments. A risk governance structure composed of independent but complementary entities facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of the Companys risk exposures and processes. Morgan Stanley Board of Directors. The Board has oversight for the Companys ERM framework and is responsible for helping to ensure that the Companys risks are managed in a sound manner. The Board has authorized the committees within the ERM framework to help facilitate its risk oversight responsibilities. Risk Committee of the Board. The BRC, appointed by the Board, is composed of non management directors. The BRC is responsible for assisting the Board in the oversight of the Companys risk governance structure; the Companys risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies regarding market, credit, and liquidity and funding risk; the Companys risk tolerance; and the performance of the Chief Risk Officer. The BRC reports to the full Board on a regular basis. Audit Committee of the Board. The BAC, appointed by the Board, is composed of independent directors (pursuant to the Companys Corporate Governance Policies and applicable New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules) and is responsible for oversight of the integrity of the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the Companys system of internal controls, the qualifications and independence of the Companys 100 Table of Contents independent auditor, and the performance of the Companys internal and independent auditors. In addition, the BAC assists the Board in its oversight of certain aspects of risk management, including review of the major franchise, reputational, legal and compliance risk exposures of the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, as well as guidelines and policies that govern the process for risk assessment and risk management. The BAC reports to the full Board on a regular basis. Operations and Technology Committee of the Board. The BOTC, established in 2011 and appointed by the Board, is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of the Companys operations and technology strategy and significant investments in support of such strategy and operational risks, reviewing the major operational risk exposures of the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The BOTC is also responsible for the review and approval of operations and technology policies, as well as the review of the Companys risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies regarding operational risk. The BOTC reports to the full Board on a regular basis. Firm Risk Committee. The Board has also authorized the FRC, a management committee appointed and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Company, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to oversee Morgan Stanleys risk management structure. The FRCs responsibilities include oversight of the Companys risk management principles, procedures and limits and the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, liquidity and funding, legal, compliance, operational, franchise and regulatory risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate, and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC reports to the full Board, the BAC, the BOTC and the BRC through the Companys Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer and the BRC, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves exceptions to the Companys risk limits; reviews material market, credit and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the BRC, the BAC, and the BOTC, as appropriate. The Chief Risk Officer also coordinates with the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board to evaluate whether the Companys compensation arrangements encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking, and whether risks arising from the Companys compensation arrangements are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Internal Audit Department. The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the BAC and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department examines the Companys operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories. Independent Risk Management Functions. The independent risk management functions (Market Risk, Credit Risk Management, Operational Risk and Corporate Treasury departments) are independent of the Companys business units. These groups assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controlling the Companys risk through a number of control processes. Each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. Further discussion about the responsibilities of the risk management functions may be found below under Market Risk, Credit Risk, and Operational Risk and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 herein. Control Groups. The Company control groups include the Human Resources Department, the Legal and Compliance Division, the Operations Division, Global Technology and Data, the Tax Department and Finance. The Company control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; the business segments market, credit and operational risk profile; sales practices; reputation; legal enforceability; and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Company and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review. 101 Table of Contents Divisional Risk Committees. Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls. Stress Value at Risk. The Company frequently enhances its market and credit risk management framework to address severe stresses that are observed in global markets during economic downturns. During 2011, the Company expanded and improved its risk measurement processes, including stress tests and scenario analysis, and further refined its market and credit risk limit framework. Stress Value at Risk (S VaR), a proprietary methodology that comprehensively measures the Companys market and credit risks, was further refined and continues to be an important metric used in establishing the Companys risk appetite and its capital allocation framework. S VaR simulates many stress scenarios based on more than 25 years of historical data and attempts to capture the different liquidities of various types of general and specific risks. Additionally, S VaR captures event and default risks that are particularly relevant for credit portfolios. Risk Management Process. The following is a discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (capital and liquidity risk is discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 herein). The discussion focuses on the Companys securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and corporate lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Companys risk exposure generated by the Companys statistical analyses are forward looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below. Market Risk. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of the Companys Value at Risk (VaR) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading related market risk within the Global Wealth Management Group. Asset Management incurs principally Non trading market risk primarily from capital investments in real estate funds and investments in private equity vehicles. Sound market risk management is an integral part of the Companys culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Companys risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains the Companys VaR and scenario analysis systems. These limits are designed to control price and market liquidity risk. Market risk is also monitored through various measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors, and scenario 102 Table of Contents analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC, and the Board of Directors. Sales and Trading and Related Activities. Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management. During 2011, the Company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities. The Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and other trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which the Company is active include, but are not limited to, the following: corporate and government debt across both developed and emerging markets and asset backed debt (including mortgage related securities). The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions (including positions in non public entities). Positions in non public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non U.S. dollar denominated financial instruments. The Company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related derivatives. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production, transportation and storage issues; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities. The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Companys aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management. Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company across all divisions worldwide. Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management. VaR. The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR based risk measures to various levels of management. 103 Table of Contents VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. The Company estimates VaR using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name specific risk in corporate shares, bonds, loans and related derivatives. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors; and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. The Companys VaR model uses four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Companys 95%/one day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. The Companys VaR model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and non linear exposures to implied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives as well as certain basis risks (e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives). Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodologys limitations, which include but are not limited to: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR. The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. The Company is aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and control at the trading desk, division and Company levels. The Companys VaR model evolves over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. The Company is committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors. Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate enhancements to the VaR model to make it more responsive to more recent market conditions while maintaining a longer term perspective. Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95%/one day VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses which, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount. 104 Table of Contents VaR for 2011. The table below presents VaR for the Companys Trading portfolio, on a year end, annual average and annual high and low basis (see Table 1 below). The VaR that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as a higher confidence level for the VaR statistic (99% rather than 95%) or a shorter historical time series of market data (one year rather than four years), are also disclosed (see Table 2 below). The Credit Portfolio VaR is disclosed as a separate category from the Primary Risk Categories. The Credit Portfolio VaR includes the mark to market relationship lending exposures and associated hedges as well as counterparty credit valuation adjustments and related hedges. A key driver of the Credit Portfolio VaR in 2011 was the Companys exposure to Monolines, principally MBIA. For further information on the Companys settlement with MBIA, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Significant Items Monoline Insurers in Part II, Item 7 herein. Trading Risks. The table below presents the Companys 95%/one day Trading VaR: Table 1: 95% VaR 95%/One Day VaR for 2011 95%/One Day VaR for 2010 Market Risk Category PeriodEnd Average High Low PeriodEnd Average High Low (dollars in millions) Interest rate and credit spread $ 66 $ 87 $ 137 $ 49 $ 92 $ 104 $ 127 $ 86 Equity price 25 31 48 21 29 28 52 19 Foreign exchange rate 18 17 27 8 20 24 50 9 Commodity price 28 30 44 23 30 28 35 21 Less: Diversification benefit(1)(2) (67 ) (63 ) N/A N/A (51 ) (66 ) N/A N/A Primary Risk Categories $ 70 $ 102 $ 170 $ 60 $ 120 $ 118 $ 149 $ 98 Credit Portfolio 52 97 124 49 74 67 79 54 Less: Diversification benefit(1)(2) (35 ) (70 ) N/A N/A (76 ) (46 ) N/A N/A Total Trading VaR $ 87 $ 129 $ 168 $ 83 $ 118 $ 139 $ 165 $ 117 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component. (2) N/A Not Applicable. The minimum and maximum VaR values for the total VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter and therefore the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. The Companys average VaR for the Primary Risk Categories for 2011 was $102 million compared with $118 million for 2010. Reduced risk taking in fixed income products was the primary driver of the decrease. The reduction in period end VaR from $120 million for 2010 to $70 million for 2011 more clearly demonstrates the reduced risk taking in fixed income products that occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2011 that continued through the fourth quarter of 2011. The average Credit Portfolio VaR for 2011 was $97 million compared with $67 million for 2010. The increase in the average VaR over the year was from increased counterparty exposure during 2011. A more meaningful comparison for the Credit Portfolio is between the period end VaR for 2011 of $52 million and the period end VaR for 2010 of $74 million. This reduction reflects the settlement with MBIA in December of 2011. The average Total Trading VaR for 2011 was $129 million compared with $139 million for 2010. This reduction was driven by the reduced risk taking in the Primary Risk Categories. The reduction in the period end Total Trading VaR represents both the reduced risk taking in fixed income products as well as the settlement with MBIA. 105 Table of Contents VaR Statistics under Varying Assumptions. VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the breadth of products included in each firms VaR model, in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market risk factors, and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the simulated market conditions. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates for similar portfolios. The impact varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is updated, and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms. Table 2 presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (95% versus 99%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four year versus one year) for market data upon which it bases its simulations. The four year VaR measure continues to reflect the high market volatilities experienced through 2007 and 2008, while the one year VaR is no longer affected by these phenomena.

This benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component. Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for 2011. One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the Companys VaR model as a measure of the Companys potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra day trading, for a 95%/one day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the adequacy of the VaR model could be questioned. Differences between recent market volatility and the historical market volatility used in the VaR model may result in the number of days in which trading losses exceed VaR to be higher or lower than statistically expected. The Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results for both the Company as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the 95% or 99% VaR statistic, the Company examines the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR models accuracy relative to realized trading results. In line with the enhanced transparency of the Companys traded market risk displayed in Tables 1 and 2, the distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues will be presented for both the Primary Risk Categories and the Total Trading populations. 106 Table of Contents Primary Risk Categories. As shown in Table 1, the Companys average 95%/one day Primary Risk Categories VaR for 2011 was $102 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 95%/one day Primary Risk Categories VaR for 2011. The most frequently occurring value was between $115 million and $130 million, while for approximately 41% of the trading days during the year, the Primary Risk Categories VaR was less than $100 million, reflecting the reduction in risk at the end of the third quarter of 2011 that continued through the fourth quarter of 2011. 107 Table of Contents The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net trading revenue for the Companys businesses that comprise the Primary Risk Categories for 2011. This excludes the non trading revenue of these businesses and the revenue associated with the Companys own credit risk. During 2011, the Companys businesses that comprise the Primary Risk Categories experienced net trading losses on 49 days, 1 day of which was in excess of the 95%/one day Primary Risk Categories VaR. 108 Table of Contents Total Trading including the Primary Risk Categories and the Credit Portfolio. As shown in Table 1, the Companys average 95%/one day Total Trading VaR, which includes the Primary Risk Categories and the Credit Portfolio, for 2011 was $129 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 95%/one day Total Trading VaR for 2011. The most frequently occurring value was between $130 million and $145 million, while for approximately 70% of the trading days during 2011, the Total Trading VaR ranged between $115 million and $145 million. 109 Table of Contents The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net trading revenue for the Companys Trading businesses for 2011. This excludes the non trading revenue of these businesses and the revenue associated with the Companys own credit risk. During 2011, the Company experienced net trading losses on 64 days, 4 days of which were in excess of the 95%/one day Trading VaR. Non Trading Risks. The Company believes that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of the Companys non trading risks. Reflected below is this analysis, which covers substantially all of the non trading risk in the Companys portfolio. Counterparty Exposure Related to the Companys Own Spread. The credit spread risk relating to the Companys own mark to market derivative counterparty exposure corresponds to an increase in value of approximately $6 million and $8 million for each 1 basis point widening in the Companys credit spread level for December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Funding Liabilities. The credit spread risk sensitivity of the Companys mark to market funding liabilities corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $12 million and $14 million for each 1 basis point widening in the Companys credit spread level at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. 110 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity on Income from Continuing Operations. The Company measures the interest rate risk of certain assets and liabilities by calculating the hypothetical sensitivity of net interest income to potential changes in the level of interest rates over the next twelve months. This sensitivity analysis includes positions that are mark to market as well as positions that are accounted for on an accrual basis. For interest rate derivatives that are perfect economic hedges to non mark to market assets or liabilities, the disclosed sensitivities include only the impact of the coupon accrual mismatch. This treatment mitigates the effects caused by the measurement basis differences between the economic hedge and the corresponding hedged instrument. Given the currently low interest rate environment, the Company uses the following two interest rate scenarios to quantify the Companys sensitivity: instantaneous parallel shocks of 100 and 200 basis point increases to all points on all yield curves simultaneously. The hypothetical model does not assume any growth, change in business focus, asset pricing philosophy or asset/liability funding mix and does not capture how the Company would respond to significant changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the model does not reflect the Companys expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, nor the actual effect on income from continuing operations before income taxes if such changes were to occur. On December 31, 2011, the Company modified its methodology so that the incremental impact of coupon accrual (net of funding expense) is derived explicitly from the projected cash flows over the next twelve months. This change provides improved accuracy over the previous method of using instantaneous shocks on mark to market positions to estimate the net effect of accrual and funding. The impact of this change on the December 31, 2011, consolidated results is a reduction of $32 million in interest income sensitivity for a +100 basis point scenario, and a reduction of $64 million for a +200 basis point scenario. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 +100 BasisPoints +200 BasisPoints +100 BasisPoints +200 BasisPoints (dollars in millions) Impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 600 $ 1,080 $ 560 $ 1,084 Impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding Citis share of MSSB(1) 370 672 343 664 (1) Reflects the exclusion of the portion of income from continuing operations before taxes associated with MSSBs noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. Principal Investments. The Company makes investments in both public and private companies. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, the majority of which are for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a 10% decline in investment values. 10% Sensitivity Investments December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (dollars in millions) Investments related to Asset Management activities: Hedge fund investments $ 141 $ 169 Private equity and infrastructure funds 108 115 Real estate funds 133 108 Other investments: Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. 144 179 Other Company investments 297 344 111 Table of Contents Credit Risk. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations. The Company incurs credit risk exposure to institutions and sophisticated investors through the Institutional Securities business segment. This risk may arise from a variety of business activities, including, but not limited to, entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to the Company; extending credit to clients through various lending commitments; providing short or long term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount; and posting margin and or collateral to clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties. The Company incurs credit risk in traded securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans. The Company incurs credit risk in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment lending to individual investors, including margin loans collateralized by securities, non purpose loans predominantly collateralized by securities, and through single family residential prime mortgage loans in conforming, nonconforming or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) form. The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of its businesses generates unique credit risks, and the Credit Risk Management Department establishes company wide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk exposure both within and across business segments. The Company employs a comprehensive and global Credit Limits Framework as one of the primary tools used to evaluate and manage credit risk levels across the Company. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within the Companys risk tolerance and includes single name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry and product type. The Credit Risk Management Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure is managed by credit professionals and committees within the Credit Risk Management Department and through various risk committees, whose membership includes the Credit Risk Management Department. The Credit Risk Management Department also works closely with the Market Risk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk exposures, including margin loans, mortgage loans, and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions. See Notes 8 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Companys financing receivables and lending commitments, respectively. Analyzing Credit Risk. Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. In order to protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities, the Credit Risk Management Department ensures lending transactions and derivative exposures are analyzed, that the creditworthiness of the Companys counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The Credit Risk Management Department assigns obligor credit ratings to the Companys counterparties and borrowers, which reflect an assessment of an obligors probability of default. Additionally, the Credit Risk Management Department evaluates the relative position of the Companys particular obligation in the borrowers capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as collateral (if applicable) and other structural elements of the particular transaction. Risk Mitigation. The Company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and trading activities in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, financial covenants, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments that may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign or sub participate funded loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterpartys rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default. 112 Table of Contents Institutional Securities Activities. Corporate Lending. In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business segment activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected corporate clients. Such loans and lending commitments can generally be classified as either relationship driven or event driven. These loans and lending commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, may be secured or unsecured, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by the Company. Relationship driven loans and lending commitments refer to loans and lending commitments used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity purposes. Commitments associated with relationship driven activities may not be indicative of the Companys actual funding requirements, as the commitment may expire unused or the borrower may not fully utilize the commitment. The Company may hedge its exposures in connection with relationship driven transactions, and commitments may be subject to conditions including financial covenants. The Companys relationship driven loans and lending commitments typically consist of revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and certain term loans. These loans are carried either at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings or amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Event driven loans and lending commitments refer to activities associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition or recapitalization activities. Commitments associated with these event driven activities may not be indicative of the Companys actual funding requirements since funding is contingent upon a proposed transaction being completed. In addition, the borrower may not fully utilize the commitment or the Companys portion of the commitment may be reduced through the syndication or sales process. The event driven loans are typically syndicated or sold to third party institutional investors. The Company may have a custodial relationship with these institutional investors, such as, prime brokerage clients. The borrowers ability to draw on the commitment is also subject to certain terms and conditions, among other factors. The Company risk manages its exposures in connection with event driven transactions through various means, including syndication, distribution and or hedging. The Companys event driven loans and lending commitments typically consist of term loans and bridge loans. These loans are carried either at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings or amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. During 2011, the Company, in accordance with its risk management practices, accounted for certain new relationship driven and event driven loans and lending commitments as held for investment. The Company may account for additional new loans and lending commitments as held for investment or held for sale in the future. 113 Table of Contents The tables below present the Companys credit exposure from its corporate lending positions and lending commitments at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The total corporate lending exposure column includes both lending commitments and funded loans. Lending commitments represent legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 for both relationship driven and event driven lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

In connection with these corporate lending activities (which include corporate funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges (which include single name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $35.8 billion and $21.0 billion related to the total corporate lending exposure of $82.9 billion and $69.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the Companys corporate lending exposure carried at fair value includes $15.2 billion of funded loans and $1.3 billion of lending commitments recorded in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Companys corporate lending exposure accounted for as held for investment includes $1.7 billion of funded loans recorded in Loans, with an allowance for loan losses of $6 million, and $8 billion of unfunded commitments with an allowance for credit losses of $17 million recorded in Other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, the Companys corporate lending exposure carried at fair value includes $11.2 billion of funded loans and $0.5 billion of lending commitments recorded in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Companys corporate lending exposure accounted for as held for investment includes $750 million of funded loans recorded in Loans with an allowance for loan losses of $0.4 million in the consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2010.

Included in the total corporate lending exposure amounts in the table above at December 31, 2011 were event driven exposure of $7.2 billion composed of funded loans of $3.0 billion and lending commitments of $4.2 billion. Included in the event driven exposure at December 31, 2011 were $3.8 billion of loans and lending commitments to non investment grade borrowers. The maturity profile of the event driven loans and lending commitments at December 31, 2011 was as follows: 55% will mature in less than 1 year, 9% will mature within 1 to 3 years, 13% will mature within 3 to 5 years, and 23% will mature in over 5 years. Included in the total corporate lending exposure amounts in the table above at December 31, 2010 were event driven exposure of $5.4 billion composed of funded loans of $1.3 billion and lending commitments of $4.1 billion. Included in the $5.4 billion of event driven exposure at December 31, 2010 were $4.9 billion of loans and lending commitments to non investment grade borrowers that were closed. The maturity profile of the event driven loans and lending commitments at December 31, 2010 was as follows: 11% will mature in less than 1 year, 21% will mature within 1 to 3 years, 26% will mature within 3 to 5 years, and 43% will mature in over 5 years. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $301 million and $646 million of the Companys event driven loans were on a non accrual basis, respectively. These loans primarily are those the Company originated prior to the financial crisis in 2008 and was unable to sell or syndicate. For loans carried at fair value that are on non accrual status, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Activity associated with the corporate event driven lending exposure during 2011 was as follows (dollars in millions): Event driven lending exposures at December 31, 2010 $ 5,409 Closed commitments 7,188 Net reductions, primarily through syndication or sales (5,368 ) Mark to market adjustments (72 ) Event driven lending exposures at December 31, 2011 $ 7,157 115 Table of Contents Other Institutional Securities Lending Activities. In addition to the primary corporate lending activity described above, the Institutional Securities business segment engages in other lending activity. At December 31, 2011, $9.2 billion of funded loans carried at fair value were recorded in Financial instruments owned in the consolidated statements of financial condition. These loans include corporate loans purchased in the secondary market, commercial and residential mortgage loans, and financing extended to equities and commodities customers. At December 31, 2011, $2.2 billion of funded loans accounted for as held for investment are recorded in Loans with an allowance for loan losses of $8 million in the consolidated statements of financial condition. These loans are primarily commercial asset backed lending. Derivative Contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and hedging purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams, exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and equity warrants typically have longer maturities. The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Companys exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets, net of cash collateral received. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition to measuring and managing credit exposures referenced to the current fair value of derivative instruments, the Company also measures and manages credit exposures referenced to potential exposure. Potential exposure is an estimate of exposure, within a specified confidence level, that could be outstanding over time based on market movements. For credit exposure information on the Companys credit derivative and other OTC derivative products, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Credit Derivatives. A credit derivative is a contract between a seller (guarantor) and buyer (beneficiary) of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The beneficiary pays a periodic premium (typically quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the guarantor is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation and payment moratorium. Debt restructurings are also considered a credit event in some cases. In certain transactions referenced to a portfolio of referenced entities or asset backed securities, deductibles and caps may limit the guarantors obligations. The Company trades in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities. The Company is an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market maker, the Company works to earn a bid offer spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. Further, the Company uses credit derivatives to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures during the periods presented. The Company actively monitors its counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of the Companys counterparties are banks, broker dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings based termination events but do include provisions related to 116 Table of Contents counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in additional collateral being required by the Company. As with all derivative contracts, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its positions and recognizes credit valuation adjustments as appropriate within Principal transactions Trading. The Companys exposure to Monolines was significantly reduced following a comprehensive settlement with MBIA on December 13, 2011. For further information on the Companys settlement with MBIA, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Significant Items Monoline Insurers in Part II, Item 7 herein. The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the Companys credit derivative portfolio by counterparty at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The fair values shown are before the application of any counterparty or cash collateral netting. At December 31, 2011 Fair Values(1) Notionals Receivable Payable Net Beneficiary Guarantor (dollars in millions) Banks and securities firms $ 123,821 $ 117,125 $ 6,696 $ 2,099,438 $ 2,039,555 Insurance and other financial institutions 13,467 13,334 133 326,633 386,720 Monolines(2) 298 5 293 18,647 Non financial entities 1,205 262 943 17,543 6,129 Total $ 138,791 $ 130,726 $ 8,065 $ 2,462,261 $ 2,432,404 (1) The Companys credit default swaps are classified in both Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Approximately 11% of receivable fair values and 7% of payable fair values represent Level 3 amounts. (2) Credit derivatives used to hedge the Companys credit exposure to Monolines (including derivative counterparty exposure) are included in the table based on the counterparties writing such hedges. None of these hedges are written by other Monolines.

Approximately 13% of receivable fair values and 8% of payable fair values represent Level 3 amounts. (2) Amounts do not include the effect of hedges of Monoline derivative counterparty exposure. Securitizations. The Company may extend short or long term funding to clients through loans and lending commitments that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, commercial and industrial company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement or a decline in the underlying collateral value. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the Companys securitization activities. Other. In addition to the activities noted above, there are other credit risks managed by the Credit Risk Management Department and various business areas within the Institutional Securities business segment. The Company incurs credit risk through margin and collateral transactions with clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties. Certain risk management activities as they pertain to establishing appropriate collateral amounts for the Companys prime brokerage and securitized product 117 Table of Contents businesses are primarily monitored within those respective areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Companys collateralized transactions. Country Risk Exposure. Country risk exposure is the risk that events within a country, such as currency crises, regulatory changes and other political events, will adversely affect the ability of the sovereign government and or obligors within the country to honor their obligations to the Company. Country risk exposure is measured in accordance with the Companys internal risk management standards and includes obligations from sovereign governments, corporations, clearinghouses and financial institutions. The Company actively manages country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals as well as scenario analysis, and allows the Company to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. Country risk exposure before and after hedges are monitored and managed, with stress testing and scenario analysis conducted on a continuous basis, to identify exposure concentrations, wrong way risk and the impact of idiosyncratic events. In addition, indirect exposures are captured and monitored through regular stress testing and counterparty, market and systemic vulnerability analysis. The Company reduces its country risk exposure through the effect of risk mitigants, such as netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Company to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties, obtaining collateral from counterparties, and by hedging. In addition to the Companys country risk exposure, the Company discloses its cross border outstanding information in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Financial Data Supplement (Unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 herein. It is based on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councils (FFIEC) regulatory guidelines for reporting cross border information and represents the amounts that the Company may not be able to obtain from a foreign country due to country specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies. There can be substantial differences between the Companys country risk exposure and cross border risk exposure. For instance, unlike the cross border risk exposure, the Companys country risk exposure includes the effect of certain risk mitigants such as obtaining collateral from counterparties. In addition, the basis for determining the domicile of the country risk exposure is different from the basis for determining the cross border risk exposure. Cross border risk exposure is reported based on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guarantor. Besides country of jurisdiction, the Company also considers factors such as physical location of operations or assets, location and source of cash flows/revenues, and location of collateral (if applicable) in order to determine the basis for country risk exposure. Furthermore, cross border risk exposure only incorporates CDS where protection is purchased while country risk exposure incorporates CDS where protection is both purchased and sold. 118 Table of Contents The Companys sovereign exposures consist of financial instruments entered into with sovereign and local governments. Its non sovereign exposures comprise exposures to corporations and financial institutions. The following table shows the Companys significant non U.S. country risk exposure, except for select European countries (see Country Risk Exposure Select European Countries herein), at December 31, 2011.

In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business segment activities, the Company has country risk exposure to many foreign countries. During 2011, certain European countries, which include Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (the European Peripherals) and France, experienced varying degrees of credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations. The following table shows the Companys country risk exposure to European Peripherals and France at December 31, 2011. Such country risk exposure is measured in accordance with the Companys internal risk management standards and includes obligations from sovereign and non sovereigns, which includes governments, corporations, clearinghouses and financial institutions.

(2) For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Global Wealth Management Group Activities. The principal Global Wealth Management Group activities that result in credit risk to the Company include margin lending, non purpose lending, and residential mortgage lending. Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Margin loans are extended on a demand basis and are not committed facilities. Factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification and in the 121 Table of Contents case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. Additionally, transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. The Company, through agreements with Citi relating to the formation of MSSB, retains certain credit risk for margin and non purpose loans that are held at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in its capacity as clearing broker for certain MSSB clients. The related loans are generally subject to the same oversight as similar margin and non purpose loans held by the Company and its subsidiaries. Non purpose securities based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any suitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carrying margin stock or refinancing margin debt. Similar to margin lending, non purpose securities based loans are structured as demand facilities. This lending activity has primarily been conducted through the Portfolio Loan Account (PLA) product platform. The Company establishes approved lines and advance rates against qualifying securities and monitors limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of non purpose securities based lending are amount of the loan, the degree of concentrated or restricted positions, and the overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification, and, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies. Underlying collateral for non purpose securities based loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. An additional non purpose lending platform, Tailored Lending (TL), provides lending to high net worth clients of MSSB, predominantly collateralized by securities. In addition to review of collateral security, credit assessment for the platform also incorporates a comprehensive analysis of the obligors financial profile and overall creditworthiness. Consequently, TL advance rates are generally higher than those offered in the PLA platform and TL facilities may be offered on a committed basis. The Global Wealth Management Group business segment also provides structured credit facilities to high net worth individuals and their small and medium sized domestic businesses, with a suite of products that includes working capital lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and commercial real estate mortgages. Decisions to extend credit are based on an analysis of the borrower, the guarantor, the collateral, cash flow, liquidity, leverage and credit history. With respect to first mortgages and second mortgages, including HELOC loans, a loan evaluation process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting policies and collateral valuation. The Companys underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis of applicable industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., FICO scores), debt ratios and reserves of the borrower. Loan to collateral value ratios are determined based on independent third party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. Historically, all mortgages were originated to be sold or securitized. Eligible conforming loans are currently held for sale, while most non conforming and HELOC loans are held for investment in the Companys portfolio. In certain instances, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions to acquire securities to cover short positions, to settle other securities obligations and to accommodate customers needs. The Company also engages in securities financing transactions for customers through margin lending. In addition, the Global Wealth Management Group business segment has employee loans that are granted primarily in conjunction with a program established by the Company to retain and recruit certain employees. These loans, recorded in Receivables Fees, interest and other in the consolidated statements of financial condition, are full 122 Table of Contents recourse, require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from four to 12 years. The Company establishes a reserve for loan amounts it does not consider recoverable from terminated employees, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense. At December 31, 2011, Global Wealth Management Group had $11.4 billion of loans held for investment with an allowance for loan losses of $3 million and $114 million of loans held for sale classified in Loans in the consolidated statements of financial condition. See Notes 2, 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Companys allowance for loan losses, collateralized transactions and financing receivables, respectively. Operational Risk. Operational risk refers to the risk of financial or other loss, or potential damage to a firms reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events (e.g., fraud, legal and compliance risks or damage to physical assets). The Company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and control groups (e.g., information technology and trade processing). Legal and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under Legal and Regulatory Risk. The Company has established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Company. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the Company and in response to the changing regulatory and business environment. The Company has implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, business environment and internal control factors and perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysis results are direct inputs to the capital model while external operational incidents, business environment internal control factors and metrics are indirect inputs to the model. Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managers therein. The business managers generally maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. Each business segment has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports to senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk matters with senior management. Oversight of operational risk is provided by regional risk committees and senior management. In the event of a merger, joint venture, divestiture, reorganization, or creation of a new legal entity, a new product or a business activity, operational risks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes or controls are implemented. Enterprise Operational Risk and Control (EORC) and the independent Operational Risk Department (ORD) work with the business segments and control groups to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive program for managing operational risk within each area and across the Company globally. ORD is responsible for the design, ownership and independent validation of the operational risk framework, analysis of operational risk data and senior governance reporting. EORC is responsible for the execution of the operational risk framework including, but not limited to facilitating, collecting and validating operational risk data. Business Continuity Management is responsible for identifying key risks and threats to the Companys resiliency and planning to ensure a recovery strategy and required resources are in place for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a company wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed 123 Table of Contents appropriate. The key components of the Companys disaster recovery plans include: crisis management; business recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing. The Company maintains an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and satisfies regulatory requirements. Information security policies are designed to protect the Companys information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These policies cover a broad range of areas, including: application entitlements, data protection, incident response, Internet and electronic communications, remote access and portable devices. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computers and other assets from unauthorized access. The Company utilizes the services of external vendors in connection with the Companys ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of means, including service level and other contractual agreements, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the future. The Supplier Risk Management program is responsible for the policies, procedures, organizations, governance and supporting technology to ensure adequate risk management controls between the Company and its third party suppliers as it relates to information security, disaster recoverability, and other key areas. The program ensures Company compliance with regulatory requirements. Legal and Regulatory Risk. Legal risk includes the risk of exposure to fines, penalties, judgments, damages and or settlements in connection with regulatory or legal actions as a result of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see also Business Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Legal and Compliance Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Companys policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company. 124 Table of Contents
