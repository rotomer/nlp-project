ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2002, 2003, AND 2004 Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Issues and Uncertainties and elsewhere in this report. OVERVIEW The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes (Notes). We generate revenues, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (PCs), and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games and peripherals. Online communication services and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world. We also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products. Delivering breakthrough innovation and high value solutions through our integrated platform are the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. We believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long term growth, delivering innovative new products, creating opportunity for partners, improving customer satisfaction with key audiences, putting some of our most significant legal challenges behind us, and solidifying internal processes. Our focus in fiscal 2005 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas, including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform, delivering compelling value propositions to customers, responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and continuing to focus internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. Key market opportunities include: Meeting the needs of a growing worldwide base of PC users, which we project will top 1 billion by 2010; Delivering new scenarios such as collaboration, authoring, communicating, planning, and analysis for information workers; Continuing to compete against Linux and Unix for commercial workloads; Reducing complexity and cost for IT professionals and developers; Delivering IT services for smaller business, and consumers; Creating and delivering business solutions for small and mid market segments; Creating non PC consumer electronics in areas such as mobile phones, handheld devices, home entertainment and TV; Delivering compelling entertainment experiences in areas such as music, TV, movies, photos, and games; Expanding online advertising, and advances in search, music and other information services; Delivering integrated communications services for consumers and information workers. For fiscal 2005, we believe industry wide factors such as PC unit growth and the success of non commercial software could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. PC unit growth was very strong in fiscal 2004, increasing approximately 13% from fiscal 2003. We do not expect similar growth to occur in fiscal 2005. PAGE 15 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 We believe that PC unit shipments will grow 7% to 9%, resulting in a forecasted fiscal 2005 Client revenue growth rate that we believe will be between 5% and 7%. We continue to watch the evolution of open source software development and distribution, and continue to differentiate our products from competitive products including those based on open source software. We believe that Microsofts share of server units grew modestly in fiscal 2004, while Linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis. The increase in Linux distributions reflects some significant public announcements of support and adoption of open source software in both the server and desktop markets in the last year. To the extent open source software products gain increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, which could result in a reduction in our revenue and operating margins. Additionally, due primarily to our announced special dividend and quarterly dividend payments, if continued, we expect investment balances and resulting investment income to decrease significantly in fiscal 2005. We have approximately $1.1 billion in original Upgrade Advantage contract value that will reach their expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. This revenue was recognized over the last two years and in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 the contract period expires. Summary (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 28,365 $ 32,187 13 % $ 36,835 14 % Operating income $ 8,272 $ 9,545 15 % $ 9,034 (5 )% Our revenue growth for fiscal 2004 was driven by licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs; Windows Server operating systems, Office, and other server applications as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments; and the continuing impact from multi year licensing that occurred prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 program in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We estimate growth in PC shipments was 13% during fiscal 2004, reflecting global economic improvement, which led to strength in the consumer segment in the first half of fiscal 2004 and to replacement PC and notebook sales in the enterprise segment in the second half of fiscal 2004. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 18% in fiscal 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal 2004, primarily due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $1.10 billion lower. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposure. Prior to the July 31, 2002 Licensing 6.0 transition date, we experienced a significant increase in multi year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs, primarily Upgrade Advantage. Revenue growth in fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by multi year licensing that occurred before the Licensing 6.0 transition date in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The revenue growth also reflected a $933 million or 13% increase associated with OEM licensing of Microsoft Windows operating systems and a $309 million or 23% increase in revenue from Microsoft Xbox video game consoles. Revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of $1.35 billion of Xbox video game system revenue and $1.20 billion of revenue growth from Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Home operating systems. For fiscal 2004, the operating income decline of $511 million was primarily caused by the $2.53 billion of charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and a fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $2.21 billion of stock based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Operating income was positively influenced by the revenue growth described above and operational improvements in our MSN business. In fiscal 2003, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.82 billion in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $2.55 billion in operating expenses, primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses, primarily the Time Warner settlement charge of $750 million. In fiscal 2002, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.07 billion in revenue, substantially offset by an increase of $3.14 billion in operating expenses, which included the onset of costs related to Xbox video game systems. We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for PAGE 16 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Stock based compensation expenses are included in operating expenses as part of headcount related costs. Total stock based compensation costs included in operating expenses were $5.73 billion in fiscal 2004, $3.75 billion in fiscal 2003, and $3.78 billion in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2005, we do not expect revenue to grow at similarly high rates as fiscal 2004, even if information technology spending continues to improve. While we expect general economic conditions to remain stable with the improvements seen in the second half of fiscal 2004, we expect PC and server unit shipment growth rates to decline in fiscal 2005 from the high growth rates in fiscal 2004. We estimate PC shipments will grow from 7% to 9% and Server unit shipments will grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. These lower growth rates may cause slower revenue growth in fiscal 2005. We are anticipating little or no year over year foreign exchange rate benefit in fiscal 2005. We anticipate that we will renew between 10% and 30% of the expiring Upgrade Advantage program revenue through conversions to Software Assurance or migration to Enterprise Agreements. Total revenue expected to be recognized in our Information Worker, Server and Tools, and Client businesses from previously deferred Upgrade Advantage revenue is $56 million. MSN had a strong year in fiscal 2004 with revenue growth of 13% driven by over 40% growth in advertising revenue. In fiscal 2005, we expect MSN to see growth in advertising revenue and subscription and transaction revenue from premium Web services, partially offset by a reduction in access revenue as narrowband subscribers continue to decline. Accordingly, we do not expect the same level of revenue growth for MSN in fiscal 2005. Home and Entertainment revenue grew moderately in fiscal 2004. We do not expect significant growth in Home and Entertainment in fiscal 2005 as price reductions in the second half of fiscal 2004 related to the late stage of the Xbox lifecycle are expected to lead to lower revenue for the Xbox business. We expect our operating income growth in fiscal 2005 to exceed our revenue growth. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to the absence of certain legal settlements which occurred in fiscal 2004, lower stock based compensation costs, and benefits achieved through continued progress in our previously announced cost efficacy initiative. We expect that our segments in fiscal 2004 that reported a segment operating loss Mobile and Embedded Devices, Microsoft Business Solutions, and Home and Entertainment will make significant progress toward segment profitability in fiscal 2005 with improved operations. SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses were $3.08 billion, $3.74 billion and $4.66 billion in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Segment information appearing in Note 18 Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The tables that follow below for each segment present our segment revenue and operating income, determined on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP: Client (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentage inc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentage inc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 9,360 $ 10,394 11 % $ 11,546 11 % Operating income $ 7,105 $ 8,017 13 % $ 8,015 nm PAGE 17 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. The growth of the Client segments revenue is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre install versions of Windows operating systems. Client revenue increase was driven by a 14% growth in OEM licenses and 16% growth in OEM revenue on increased consumer PC unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business PC unit shipments in the second half of fiscal 2004. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 4% due to lower revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and lower packaged product sales. In fiscal 2003, Client revenue growth was driven by OEM licensing revenue growth of $933 million and a 9 percentage point increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the OEM channel. Windows Professional revenue growth for fiscal 2003 was $1.59 billion, or 31%, compared to fiscal 2002. The Windows Professional growth in fiscal 2003 was partially offset by a $573 million decline in revenue from earlier versions of Windows operating systems. Client operating income was flat for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased operating expenses primarily related to the charge for the Sun Microsystems settlement of $700 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $307 million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, offset by growth in revenue. Operating income for fiscal 2003 increased primarily as a result of the 11% growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs. We estimate that PC market growth will be from 7% to 9% in fiscal 2005. We expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates and we expect to hold our share in these respective markets. The differential market growth rate is expected to result in lower unit license growth in the OEM business and lower revenue growth, as piracy continues to be problematic in emerging markets, and significant price changes are not anticipated. We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix but expect to see only modest improvements in fiscal 2005. The Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth. We expect operating profits as a percentage of Client revenue to improve in fiscal 2005, due to the legal settlements expenses and stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in fiscal 2004. Major investments in fiscal 2005 include development of the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn), security programs, and marketing initiatives, including those related to Windows XP Service Pack 2 and other new products. Server and Tools (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentage inc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentage inc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 6,157 $ 7,140 16 % $ 8,483 19 % Operating income $ 747 $ 1,121 50 % $ 96 (91 )% Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Growth in the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software, is the principal driver for Server and Tools revenue growth. The segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Products are sold through OEMs, distributors, direct to customers, and through one time licenses or multi year volume license agreements. We estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 16% in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.28 billion or 25% driven primarily by an estimated 18% increase in Windows based server shipments resulting in 15% growth in new Windows Server licenses, and by favorable conversion of revenue billed in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue increased $189 million or 19% compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, and Microsoft Press and other services declined $128 million or 14% compared to fiscal 2003 due to recognition of revenue deferred in prior years. Foreign exchange rates contributed approximately $350 million or 5% of Server and Tools revenue growth. PAGE 18 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Total Server and Tools revenue grew $983 million or 16% in fiscal 2003, driven by an increase in Windows based server shipments and growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Windows Server and CALs revenue grew $787 million or 18% from fiscal 2002 as a result of increased new and anniversary multi year licensing agreements. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $91 million or 10% compared to fiscal 2002. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, and other services increased $105 million or 13% from fiscal 2002. Server and Tools operating income for fiscal 2004 declined primarily due to the charge for the Sun Microsystems settlement of $1.22 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $651 million of stock based compensation costs from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Server and Tools operating income for fiscal 2003 grew 50%, primarily as a result of the 16% increase in revenue. We anticipate that overall server hardware shipments will grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 and new licenses of Windows Server operating system will grow slightly faster than the overall market. We believe that Windows Server 2003 shipments will create opportunities for sales of Windows Server System products. However, we face strong competition from the Linux based, Unix, and other server operating systems. In addition, Server and Tools net revenue for fiscal 2005 will be unfavorably affected by the absence of revenue earned from our Upgrade Advantage program and no anticipated foreign exchange benefit. Information Worker (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentage inc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentage inc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 8,212 $ 9,229 12 % $ 10,800 17 % Operating income $ 5,932 $ 6,486 9 % $ 7,151 10 % Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and professional product support services. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other Information Worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration. Revenue growth for fiscal 2004 from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre installed versions of Office in Japan was 15% in aggregate. This increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi year licenses signed prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 programs and approximately $110 million related to the launch of Office 2003. OEM licensing revenue grew 29% or $325 million. Foreign exchange rates provided approximately $485 million or 5% of total Information Worker revenue growth. The $1.02 billion or 12% increase in revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to growth in Office suites revenue associated with new and anniversary multi year licensing agreements and a $264 million or 28% increase in revenue from the combined total of Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, and other stand alone applications. Information Worker operating income in fiscal 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to $351 million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses. Information Worker operating profit for fiscal 2003 grew 9% compared to fiscal 2002, led by the 12% increase in revenue and partially offset by a 20% growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses. Fiscal 2005 Information Worker revenue is expected to be similar to fiscal 2004. We are expecting a reduction in revenue earned from our Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and no anticipated foreign exchange rate benefit. The significant reduction in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue is expected to be offset by sustained momentum in our OEM and multi year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of Office System 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations. PAGE 19 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Microsoft Business Solutions (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 308 $ 567 84 % $ 667 18 % Operating loss $ (301 ) $ (309 ) 3 % $ (255 ) (17 )% Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, MBN/Retail Manager and other business applications and services. Our revenue is generally derived from developing and marketing integrated, end to end business applications and services designed to help small and mid market businesses. The small and mid market business applications market is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors. Microsoft Business Solutions revenues are affected by the general economic environment and enterprise information technology spending in particular. The revenue increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision and Axapta ERP products, and new sales of Microsoft CRM. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $259 million from fiscal 2002, of which $246 million was attributable to the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year. The operating loss for fiscal 2004 declined from fiscal 2003 due to the increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including $42 million of lower amortization costs, partially offset by $27 million in stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to operating losses associated with Navision, increases in sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and acquisition related costs. We announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a plan to align and include the Small and Mid Market Solutions & Partners (SMS&P) organization in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. This change is designed to optimize our focus on delivering business applications to small and mid market segment businesses. The SMS&P organization is currently part of the Information Worker segment. This reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the Microsoft Business Solutions and Information Worker reported results, primarily from the reorganization of approximately $100 million in revenue and costs associated with our Partner program offerings, which will move from Information Worker segment to Microsoft Business Solutions. In fiscal 2005, we expect continued growth for Microsoft Business Solutions through CRM, Axapta, Navision, and Great Plains product lines with increased sales and marketing focus from the SMS&P organization, and new product launches for Great Plains and Navision. MSN (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 1,571 $ 1,953 24 % $ 2,216 13 % Operating income/(loss) $ (909 ) $ (567 ) (38 )% $ 121 nm The MSN segment includes personal communications services, such as e mail and instant messaging, and information services, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the World. MSN also provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment including MSN Internet Access, and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. In fiscal 2004, MSN advertising revenue increased $360 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. This increase was partially offset by a decline of $168 million or 15% in Internet access revenue, primarily from the migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscription and transaction services other than Internet access increased $71 million in fiscal 2004 to $95 million. At the end of the current fiscal year, MSN had 4.3 million internet access subscribers compared to 6.5 million at the end of the prior fiscal year and 8.8 million total subscribers compared to 8.6 million at the end of the prior year. In addition, MSN has over 350 million unique users PAGE 20 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 monthly, 187 million active Hotmail accounts, and 135 million active Messenger accounts. Compared to fiscal 2002, MSN advertising revenue grew $270 million or 48% in fiscal 2003 as a result of growth in paid search and strong online advertising sales across all geographic regions. MSN subscription revenue grew $112 million or 11% in fiscal 2003 reflecting an increase in the number of paying non promotion subscribers. MSN reached segment profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and was profitable for the full fiscal year. The improvement in profitability was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from advertising in both display and paid search, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet access business, efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses, and a $48 million refund of prior year taxes, partially offset by $144 million of stock based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. MSN operating loss for fiscal 2003 decreased from fiscal 2002, primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription acquisition and support costs. MSN expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for premium Web services to increase in fiscal 2005. Advertising revenue should benefit from expected increases in Internet spending and additions to the advertising platform including music download service, communication innovations, and an improved search engine. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet access to decline in fiscal 2005 as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband Internet access. We announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 an increase to the amount of storage we will provide for select MSN and Hotmail email accounts which will increase operating costs and may impact the revenues from our extra storage customers. However, we expect the segment to increase its profitability in fiscal 2005, led by continued operational efficiencies and lower unit margin costs in both the subscriber and advertising businesses. Mobile and Embedded Devices (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 112 $ 156 39 % $ 247 58 % Operating loss $ (275 ) $ (277 ) 1 % $ (224 ) (19 )% Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The segments products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile phones and Pocket PCs. The segment is also responsible for managing sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunications, cable and wireless companies, and host and network equipment providers. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles that affect our continuing revenue streams. Unit volume increases drove revenue growth for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 in all product lines. The growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of OEMs and mobile operators shipping Windows Mobile software for SmartPhones, increases in market share for our Pocket PC and embedded products and increased usage by existing customers of our MapPoint Web Service. Revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $44 million driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing. Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for fiscal 2004 decreased compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in revenue and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by $58 million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Operating loss for fiscal 2003 grew 1% from the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcount related costs associated with product development offset the growth in revenue. We expect demand for mobile and embedded devices based on Windows Mobile software to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity as well as by an increase in the number of OEMs and mobile operators offering Windows based devices. PAGE 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Home and Entertainment (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentage inc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentage inc./ (dec.) Revenue $ 2,453 $ 2,748 12 % $ 2,876 5 % Operating loss $ (1,135 ) $ (1,191 ) 5 % $ (1,215 ) 2 % Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The relative success of competing video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the relative market share of the console. We are a relatively new entrant in the video game console businesses with our first release in fiscal 2002, and have established ourselves as one of the leaders. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since 2002, but revenue growth moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this stage in the console lifecycle. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, providing higher margins to offset the decreasing price trend on consoles sold. In fiscal 2004, Xbox revenue increased $144 million or 9% with $269 million related to higher Xbox software volumes and $117 million due to higher Xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $242 million decline related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Overall, Xbox console volumes increased 11% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The Xbox life to date U.S. games attach rate increased to 6.9 games per console according to industry analyst NPD as of June 30, 2004. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $16 million or 1% compared to fiscal 2003 due to lower PC games software and PC gaming devices sales, partially offset by the new release of Mac Office. The increase in Home and Entertainment revenue in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 was the result of sales of Xbox video game systems and related games which were available for all of fiscal 2003. Xbox revenue grew $309 million or 23% in fiscal 2003 reflecting a $779 million increase from higher volumes for Xbox consoles, games, and peripherals partially offset by a $470 million decrease due to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $14 million or 1% in fiscal 2003, driving the decrease in Home Products revenue. The increase in operating loss in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $141 million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, increased sales of negative margin consoles, and costs associated with the next generation console development efforts, partially offset by increased Xbox and Mac Office software sales. The operating loss increase from fiscal 2003 also included a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately $90 million, reflecting the current stage in the lifecycle of the Xbox console. Operating loss in 2003 increased by $56 million or 5% from the prior year as the product costs associated with the increased Xbox console sales and increased marketing expense more than offset the 12% increase in revenue. In fiscal 2005, we expect Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 consistent with this stage of the Xbox console lifecycle, partially offset by increased unit volumes driven by the launch of software titles such as Halo2. In fiscal 2005 we expect PC games revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 driven by fewer new game titles. Other HPD revenue are expected to increase moderately as a result of the launch of the latest version of Mac Office late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we expect operating margins to improve from fiscal 2004 driven by lower unit volumes of negative margin consoles and increased sales of high margin software. We expect development spending to be higher in fiscal 2005 driven by investment in the next generation Xbox platform design. Cost of revenue (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.) Cost of revenue $ 5,699 $ 6,059 6 % $ 6,716 11 % As a percent of revenue 20.1 % 18.8 % (1.3 )pp 18.2 % (0.6 )pp PAGE 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased product support and consulting services costs of $508 million, $214 million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, and a lower of cost or market adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by approximately $90 million, reflecting the current stage of the life cycle of the Xbox console, partially offset by $365 million decrease in MSN services costs. In fiscal 2003, the primary driver of the increase was a 4.4 percentage point increase from Home and Entertainment products and a 1.6 percentage point decrease from MSN product and service costs in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Research and development (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.)

Research and development expenses also include third party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $1.31 billion of stock based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 as well as other headcount related payroll and other employee costs related to a 3% growth in research and development headcount from fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the increase reflects an increase in headcount related costs, a 25% increase in third party product development costs, and a 29% increase in testing laboratory equipment and expense. Sales and marketing (In millions, except percentages) 2002 2003 Percentageinc./ (dec.) 2004 Percentageinc./ (dec.)

Sales and marketing costs increased in fiscal 2004 due to $400 million of stock based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and other headcount related costs related to a 9% growth in sales and marketing headcount. In fiscal 2003, the sales and marketing expense increase of $1.31 billion dollars was due to an increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions, principally related to the Enterprise and Small/Medium Business sales forces, and a 21% increase in marketing expenses.

General and administrative costs increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to legal expenses including $1.92 billion of charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement, a $605 million fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $280 million of stock based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, other legal costs of approximately $104 million, and other headcount related costs. General and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 increased $583 million from fiscal 2002 due to a charge of $750 million related to a settlement with Time Warner in the fourth quarter of 2003 and a $256 million charge reflecting an increase in our estimate of costs related to resolving pending antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits. Investment Income/(Loss), and Income Taxes Investment Income/(Loss) The components of investment income/(loss) in each fiscal year are as follows: (In millions) / Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 Dividends and interest $ 2,119 $ 1,957 $ 1,892 Net recognized gains (losses) on investments (1,807 ) 44 1,563 Net losses on derivatives (617 ) (424 ) (268 ) Investment income /(loss) $ (305 ) $ 1,577 $ 3,187 Dividends and interest income decreased $65 million in fiscal 2004 mainly due to lower dividend income resulting from the exchange of AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of Comcast during fiscal 2003 and declining interest rates, partly offset by a larger investment portfolio. Net recognized gains (losses) on investments include other than temporary impairments of $82 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.15 billion in the prior year as well as higher net realized gains on sales in fiscal 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes. Net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal 2004 and $1.19 billion in fiscal 2003. The decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions. Derivative losses decreased $156 million to $268 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities. In fiscal 2003, dividends and interest income decreased $162 million driven primarily by a reduction in dividend income of $97 million resulting from the exchange of AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of Comcast during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and declining interest rates partially offset by a larger investment portfolio. Net recognized gains (losses) on investments includes other than temporary impairments of $1.15 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $4.32 billion in fiscal 2002 and net realized gains on investments of $1.19 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $2.52 billion in fiscal 2002. The decrease in other than temporary impairments in 2003 was also due to the reduced cost basis of investments resulting from significant 2002 impairments of investments in the cable and telecommunications sectors. In fiscal 2002, other than temporary impairments of $4.32 billion primarily related to our investment in AT&T and other cable and telecommunication investments. Net realized gains on the sales of investments of $2.52 billion included a $1.25 billion gain on sale of our interest in Expedia. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. PAGE 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 33%. A benefit of $208 million was recorded during the fourth quarter from the reversal of previously accrued taxes from resolving the remaining open issue remanded by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in December 2002. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately 27%. During the third quarter the tax rate increased due to the European Commission fine, which is not tax deductible. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 32% each year. The fiscal 2003 rate reflected a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the initial items from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling referred to above, that reversed, in part, a previous Tax Court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%. Stock based Compensation. We implemented changes in fiscal 2004 in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Generally, employees are now granted stock awards instead of stock options. The stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher (eligible options) to JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan). The unvested eligible options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. The price paid by JPMorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of Microsoft common stock during the period from November 14, 2003 to December 8, 2003, which was $25.5720. Note 13 Employee Stock and Savings Plan of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides additional information on employee stock and savings plans. In addition, effective July 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes. Given these changes the following table provides stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2002 through 2004 by segment. (In millions, except expense per share)(1) 2002 2003 2004 Client $ 471 $ 450 $ 738 Server and Tools 1,301 1,274 1,862 Information Worker 516 510 848 Microsoft Business Solutions 125 129 147 MSN 268 262 392 Mobile and Embedded Devices 118 129 170 Home and Entertainment 261 257 381 Corporate 724 738 1,196 Stock based employee compensation expense $ 3,784 $ 3,749 $ 5,734 After tax stock based employee compensation expense $ 2,573 $ 2,512 $ 3,842 After tax stock based employee compensation expense per diluted share $ 0.23 $ 0.23 $ 0.35 (1) The amounts for fiscal 2004 include $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after tax or $0.14 per diluted share) due to the completion of the employee stock option transfer program. PAGE 25 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash and short term investment portfolio totaled $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. Equity and other investments were $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the related products life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post delivery support services to be performed in the future. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2004 decreased $838 million from June 30, 2003, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi year licensing that has outpaced additions by $397 million, primarily due to recognition from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and a $489 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. Starting April 1, 2003 revenue deferred for undelivered elements reflected lower deferral rates, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. We earned approximately $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion from the Upgrade Advantage programs for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively and expect to earn approximately $56 million in fiscal 2005 from those programs. Cash Flows Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. The decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the European Commission fine mentioned above partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. Cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflects that we did not repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. We repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2004. Cash used for investing was $2.75 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $4.47 billion from fiscal 2003, due to a $3.63 billion decrease in net investment purchases and a $1.06 billion decrease in acquisition spending. Cash flow from operations was $15.80 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of $1.29 billion from fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels. Cash used for financing was $5.22 billion in fiscal 2003, an increase of $651 million from the prior year. The increase reflects a cash dividend payment of $857 million in 2003 and an increase of $417 million in common stock repurchase, offsetting $623 million received for common stock issued. We repurchased 238.2 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2003. Cash used for investing was $7.21 billion in fiscal 2003, a decrease of $3.63 billion from fiscal 2002, due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments. Cash flow from operations was $14.51 billion for fiscal 2002, an increase of $1.09 billion from fiscal 2001. The increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased Upgrade Advantage during the Licensing 6.0 transition period. This resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount. Cash used for financing was $4.57 billion in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.01 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year. PAGE 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 We repurchased 245.6 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002. In addition, 10.2 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction. We entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001, which gave us the right to acquire 10.2 million of our shares in exchange for an up front net payment of $264 million. Cash used for investing was $10.85 billion in fiscal 2002, an increase of $2.11 billion from fiscal 2001. We have no material long term debt. Stockholders equity at June 30, 2004 was $74.8 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $129 million on June 30, 2004. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $318 million, $290 million, and $331 million in fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2004, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. On July 20, 2004, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share payable on September 14, 2004, to shareholders of record on August 25, 2004. In addition, the board approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft Common stock over the next four years. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using our cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The board also approved a one time special dividend of $3.00 per share, or approximately $32 billion, subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee equity compensation awards to offset the impact of the special dividend. The special dividend will be payable on December 2, 2004, to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004, conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held November 9, 2004. We believe existing cash and short term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and our special dividend as well as regular quarterly dividends. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. Off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations Off balance sheet arrangements We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiters new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $11 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of either repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we might recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiters assets. The proceeds from an asset liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the many factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds. PAGE 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2004: (In millions)(1) Payments due by period 2005 2006 2008 2009 2011 2012 andthereafter Total Long term debt $ $ $ $ $ Construction commitments(2) 127 2 129 Lease obligations: Capital leases 7 17 10 34 Operating leases(3) 141 250 86 24 501 Purchase commitments(4) 1,340 130 90 1,560 Other long term liabilities(5) 204 14 4 222 Total contractual obligations $ 1,615 $ 603 $ 200 $ 28 $ 2,446 (1) We have excluded the recorded $1.04 billion contingent liability related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits referred to in the third paragraph of Note 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements as the timing and amount to be resolved in cash versus vouchers is subject to uncertainty. (2) We have certain commitments for the construction of buildings. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (3) Our future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases comprise the majority of the operating lease obligations presented above. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (4) Purchase commitments represent obligations under agreements which are not unilaterally cancelable by us, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices. We generally require purchase orders for vendor and third party spending. The amount presented above as purchase commitments includes an analysis of all known contracts exceeding $5 million in the aggregate as well as all known open purchase orders. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (5) We have excluded unearned revenue of $1.66 billion from other long term liabilities presented above as these will not be settled in cash. We have also excluded the liability recorded for the Jupiter guarantee of $11 million. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 46R (FIN 46R), a revision to Interpretation 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46 prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of FIN 46R or elect early adoption of FIN 46R. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB ratified the recognition and measurement guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The recognition and measurement guidance will be PAGE 28 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning with our first fiscal quarter 2005. We do not believe the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF Issue No. 03 1 will have a material impact on our financial statements. In July 2004, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) consensus on Issue No. 02 14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock, which provides guidance regarding application of the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock. EITF Issue No. 02 14 will be effective beginning with our second quarter of fiscal 2005. We do not believe the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02 14 will have a material impact on our financial statements. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes. We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97 2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the products estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse affect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary. In the past, we have had substantial impairments in our portfolio as discussed in Note 4 Investment Income/(Loss). If market, industry and or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer PAGE 29 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report, which, among others, should be considered in evaluating our future financial performance. Challenges to our Business Model. Since our inception, our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us. Under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products. We believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. In recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model. Under the non commercial software model, open source software produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and made available for license to end users without charge is distributed by firms at nominal cost that earn revenue on complementary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. The most notable example of open source software is the Linux operating system. While we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity, and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software, the popularization of the non commercial software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model, including recent efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. To the extent opens source software gains increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline. Intellectual Property Rights. We defend our intellectual property rights, but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us. While this adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the United States is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of PAGE 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively, and revenue could be adversely affected by further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers. From time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow. Responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. If we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions, our operating margins may decline as a result. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross licenses of broad patent portfolios. Unauthorized Disclosure of Source Code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and software programs, is the most significant asset we own. While we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described below under Security. New Products and Services. We have made significant investments in research, development and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including Longhorn, Microsoft .NET, Xbox, business applications, MSN, and mobile and wireless technologies. Significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, these products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. Litigation. As discussed in Note 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. There exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Security. Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for us and our customers. There are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. While this is an industry wide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms, our customers in particular have been victims of such attacks and will likely continue to be so. We are devoting significant resources to addressing these critical issues. We are focusing our efforts on engineering more secure products, optimizing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products, and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment. In addition, we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released. We are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed. We are also advising customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools, our published security guidance, and the deployment of security software such as firewalls, antivirus, and other security software. These steps could adversely affect our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to purchase competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. PAGE 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Declines in Demand for Software. If overall market demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Additionally, our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers. A significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to Licensing 6.0 in July 2002. These agreements generally expired throughout fiscal 2004 and will largely be expired by the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2005. The rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenue. We are making significant investments in the next release of the Windows operating system, code named Longhorn. If this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers, our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected. Product Development Schedule. The development of software products is a complex and time consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products, particularly any delays in the Longhorn operating system, could adversely affect our revenue. General Economic and Geo Political Risks. Softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue. Terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. Competition. We continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Taxation of Extraterritorial Income. In August 2001, a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 (ETI) constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The U.S. government appealed the panels decision and lost its appeal. On March 1, 2004, the European Union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on a specified list of U.S. source goods. In May, the U.S. Senate passed the Jumpstart our Business Strength (JOBS) Act that would repeal ETI, provide a three year phase out of current ETI benefits, and would replace ETI with a phased in 9% domestic production activity deduction that would not be fully effective until 2012. The U.S. House of Representatives passed similar legislation in June that would repeal ETI effective December 31, 2004, provide a two year phase out of ETI benefits, and replace ETI with a 3% tax rate reduction for income from domestic production activities that would be full phased in by 2006. Neither bill will fully replace our current ETI tax benefits. Both bills must still be reconciled in conference, and significant changes could be made to the final legislation, so we remain unable to assess the ultimate form and financial impact of this legislation, if enacted. If the ETI provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted, the loss of the ETI tax benefit to us could be significant. Other Potential Tax Liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result. Insurance Programs. In addition to conventional third party insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. As of June 30, 2004, the face value of captive insurance arrangements was $2.0 PAGE 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7, 7A billion. Actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles, exclusions, other restrictions, and claims. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks, the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed in this document or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. Business Disruptions in the Event of a Catastrophic Event. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake, cyber attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. Other. Other issues and uncertainties may include: warranty and other claims for hardware products such as Xbox; sales channel disruption, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor; the effects of the Consent Decree in U.S. v. Microsoft and Final Judgment in State of New York v. Microsoft on the Windows operating system and server business, including those associated with protocol and other disclosures required by the Decree and Final Judgment and the ability of PC manufacturers to hide end user access to certain new Windows features; currency fluctuations; our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; the continued availability of third party distribution channels for MSN service and other online services; factors associated with our international operations, as described under Operations in Part I, Item 1 of this report; and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments, such as the Comcast Corporation securities held by us that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, and fixed income and equity price risks. A portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position. We hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. However, we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. We use a value at risk (VAR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VAR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies and equities is geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, the mean reverting geometric Brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixed income securities prices revert to maturity value over time. Value at risk is calculated by, first, simulating 10,000 market price paths over 20 days for equities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices. Each PAGE 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A resulting unique set of equities prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates is then applied to substantially all individual holdings to re price each holding. The 250th worst performance (out of 10,000) represents the value at risk over 20 days at the 97.5 percentile confidence level. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. We hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars. In these arrangements, we hedge a securitys equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the securitys appreciation above the sold call strike, in exchange for premium received for the sold call. We also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. We have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in prior periods. The VAR amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. Losses in fair value over a 20 day holding period can exceed the reported VAR by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the 20 day holding period used in the VAR analysis. VAR amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The VAR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency, and equity risks. These VAR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. We use historical data to estimate VAR. Given the reliance on historical data, VAR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation in VAR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. The following table sets forth the VAR calculations for substantially all of our positions: (In millions) Year ended June 30, 2004 Risk Categories 2003 2004 Average High Low Interest rates $ 448 $ 298 $ 625 $ 817 $ 298 Currency rates $ 141 $ 207 $ 217 $ 326 $ 117 Equity prices $ 869 $ 773 $ 969 $ 1,174 $ 770 The total VAR for the combined risk categories is $835 million at June 30, 2004 and $987 million at June 30, 2003. The total VAR is 35% less at June 30, 2004 and 32% less at June, 30 2003 than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table, due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. The change in the absolute value of VAR is primarily due to asset allocation shifts and portfolio growth. PAGE 34 Table of Contents Part II Item 8
