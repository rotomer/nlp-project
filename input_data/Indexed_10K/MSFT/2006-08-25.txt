Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies of this report. We operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks. We operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. Pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might PAGE 16 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the United States and other countries. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. While we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues. General economic and geo political risks may affect our revenue and profitability. Inflation, softness in corporate information technology spending, or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or generally and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. Catastrophic events may disrupt our business. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake, cyber attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. Acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we dont realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make, or that we may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of managements attention from our other businesses. These factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. We have limited insurance. We maintain third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss. Because of the unavailability or high cost of conventional insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. As of June 30, 2006, the face value of captive insurance arrangements was $2.0 billion. Actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles, exclusions, other restrictions, and claims. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with the risks discussed in this report or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. We store and process significant amounts of personally identifiable information as we offer a large array of products and services to our customers. It is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products also enable our customers to store and process personal data. Perceptions that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products. Other risks that may affect our business. Other factors that may affect our performance may include: sales channel disruption, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor; our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; the continued availability of third party distribution channels for MSN service and other online offerings; and disruption to our operations as a result of weather related events. PAGE 17 Table of Contents Part I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2006 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices consist of approximately 11.0 million square feet of office building space located in King County, Washington: 8.5 million square feet of owned space that is situated on approximately 500 acres of land we own in our corporate campus and approximately 2.5 million square feet of space we lease. We own approximately 533,000 square feet of office building space domestically (outside of the Puget Sound corporate campus) and lease many sites domestically totaling approximately 2.7 million square feet of office building space. We occupy many sites internationally, totaling approximately 6.9 million square feet that is leased and approximately 883,000 square feet that is owned. These facilities include our European Operations Center that leases a 187,000 square foot campus in Dublin, Ireland, a 56,000 square foot disk duplication facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico, and a 159,000 square foot facility in Singapore for our Asia Pacific Operations Center and Regional headquarters. Leased office building space includes the following locations: Tokyo, Japan 408,000 square feet; Unterschleissheim, Germany 381,000 square feet; Les Ulis, France 262,000 square feet; Reading, England 241,000 square feet; and Mississauga, Canada 161,000 square feet. In addition to the above locations, we have various product development facilities, both domestically and internationally, as described in Operations above. Our facilities are fully used for current operations of all segments, and suitable additional space is available to accommodate expansion needs. We own 63 acres of land in Issaquah, Washington, which can accommodate 1.2 million square feet of office space and we have an agreement with the City of Redmond under which we may develop an additional 2.2 million square feet of facilities at our campus in Redmond, Washington. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On May 22, 2006, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) denied our motion for reconsideration of the formal written ruling against us in its competition law investigation of the company. As part of its decision, however, the KFTC dropped the requirement prohibiting us from including Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger, or any feature with similar functionality, in any product other than the Windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. Our request to stay the KFTC corrective order was denied on July 31, 2006. Our appeal of the KFTCs decision to the Seoul High Court is still pending. On July 12, 2006, the European Commission announced its determination that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements in its 2004 Decision against us, and levied a fine of 281 million ($351 million). We intend to appeal this fine to the Court of First Instance. We have completed the written and oral procedures in our appeal of the Commissions underlying March 2004 decision finding Microsoft in violation of European competition law and accompanying 497 million ($605 million) fine and are awaiting a decision by the Court of First Instance. See Note 17 Contingencies in 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2006, 2005, AND 2004 OVERVIEW The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (Notes). We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world. Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, Home and Entertainment has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future. We intend to sustain the long term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security, and value of Windows operating systems. We also are increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets. In addition, we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing the easiest to deploy and manage and most secure with the lowest total cost of ownership. We continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business, including business solutions, mobile computing, communication, entertainment, and others that we believe may contribute to our long term growth. We also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products. We believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. We believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long term growth by delivering innovative products, creating opportunities for partners, improving customer satisfaction with key audiences, putting some of our most significant legal cases behind us, and improving our internal business processes. Our focus in fiscal year 2007 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas, including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform, responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and continuing to focus internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. Key market opportunities include: Strengthening core businesses through new product launches, upgrades, making inroads against software piracy, and extending PC accessibility to new consumers in emerging markets. Succeeding in adjacent businesses by offering extensions of our technologies targeted towards specific customer needs either as new products or as higher value versions of existing products. Entering new markets as we redefine how people create, deliver, and experience entertainment. Delivering software services through online consumer services and services for businesses that enable workers to collaborate interactively. PAGE 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games and Internet service offerings. We expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. As open source software development and distribution evolves, we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competing products that are based on open source software. We believe that Microsofts share of server unit operating systems increased in fiscal year 2006. Summary of Results for Fiscal Years 2006, 2005, and 2004 (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 44,282 $ 39,788 $ 36,835 11% 8% Operating income $ 16,472 $ 14,561 $ 9,034 13% 61% Our revenue growth for fiscal year 2006 was driven primarily by growth in SQL Server following the launch of SQL Server 2005 in the second quarter, Windows Server and other server applications, increased Xbox revenue resulting from the Xbox 360 launch in the second quarter, growth in licensing of Windows client operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 11% to 13% during fiscal year 2006. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year. Revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, licensing of Windows client operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. The November 2004 launch of the Halo 2 Xbox game also contributed to overall revenue growth for the company. Total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 11% to 13% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a $1.08 billion decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage in fiscal year 2005. This revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired. Fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of Windows client operating systems through OEMs, Windows Server operating systems, Office and other server applications as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments. The worldwide PC shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13% and the Windows server shipment was estimated at 18% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. This resulted in approximately $1.10 billion growth in total revenue. Operating income for fiscal year 2006 increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by a $1.62 billion increase in cost of revenue primarily related to Xbox 360 and a $1.26 billion increase in sales and marketing expense primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch related spending. Headcount related costs, including stock based compensation expense, increased $682 million or 7% resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16% growth in headcount over the past twelve months. Stock based compensation expense decreased $733 million or 30% reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense. Operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 due to a decline in stock based compensation expense; increased revenue in Server and Tools, Client and Information Worker, which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments; and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation. In addition, strong sales of Halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the Home and Entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005. The $3.29 billion decrease in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. General and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the settlement of Sun PAGE 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the European Commission in fiscal year 2004. This effect was partially offset by legal expenses of $2.08 billion related to settlements with IBM, Novell, Gateway, and end user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters. In fiscal year 2004, the operating income decline was caused primarily by $2.53 billion of legal charges and $2.21 billion of stock based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program, mainly offset by an increase in revenue. We implemented changes in employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan). The unvested options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. A total of 345 million of the 621 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. As a result of these changes, stock based compensation expense decreased in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and we expect stock based compensation expense related to stock options to continue to decrease in fiscal year 2007. Fiscal Year 2007 Outlook In fiscal year 2007, we expect continued double digit revenue growth primarily as a result of the upcoming launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow between 8% and 10%. We expect that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. We estimate worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 10% and 12% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. We do not expect a significant impact from year over year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2007. We expect our operating income growth rate to lag our revenue growth rate in the first half of fiscal year 2007 due to an increasing mix of Xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments in preparation for the launches of our flagship products. We expect this trend to reverse in the second half of the fiscal year when we expect operating income to grow faster than revenue. SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) Our seven segments were Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. On July 17, 2006, we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in September 2005. These changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007; the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004. The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. The segment information appearing in Note 18 Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Companys internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the fiscal year 2006 presentation. Client (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 13,209 $ 12,151 $ 11,556 9% 5% Operating income $ 10,203 $ 9,464 $ 8,740 8% 8% PAGE 23 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Client consists of premium edition operating systems, including Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems, including Windows XP Home. Premium offerings are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. Client revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in OEM revenue driven by 17% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. During the year, the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (OEM Premium Mix) increased two percentage points to 52%. OEM revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with OEM distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other Microsoft channels. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the OEM Premium Mix, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders. Client revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12% growth in OEM license units and $886 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. The OEM Premium Mix remained flat at 50% of total OEM Windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. Revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue. Client operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in OEM revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and Windows Vista pre launch programs. Headcount related costs increased 6% in fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Client operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in OEM revenue and a $444 million decrease in stock based compensation expense. These factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with Start Something, a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. The additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of Windows Vista. Server and Tools (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 11,467 $ 9,938 $ 8,590 15% 16% Operating income $ 4,323 $ 3,291 $ 1,474 31% 123% Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CAL) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one time licenses and as multi year volume licenses. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools revenue increased during fiscal year 2006 mainly driven by growth in SQL Server, Windows Server, and Core CAL. SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. Revenue is impacted by overall server hardware shipments which we estimate grew 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue grew $1.31 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 30% for PAGE 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 the year. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $218 million or 15% primarily due to higher demand for services. In fiscal year 2005, Server and Server application revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.10 billion or 17%. Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue increased $241 million or 19% compared to the previous year. Foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for $284 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth, which was offset by a $314 million decline in Upgrade Advantage revenue earned. Server and Tools operating income increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses. Excluding headcount related costs, sales and marketing expenses increased $274 million due to additional spending to support long term strategies and marketing expenses primarily related to the launch of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Total Server and Tools headcount related costs increased 5% related to both an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. In fiscal year 2005, Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue and a $1.07 billion decrease in stock based compensation expense. This increase was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount related costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Information Worker (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 11,756 $ 11,169 $ 10,748 5% 4% Operating income $ 8,285 $ 8,025 $ 7,458 3% 8% Information Worker primarily consists of the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers, solutions, and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CAL, and other information worker products including Office Communications Server and OneNote. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Information Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $521 million or 5% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, while OEM revenue increased $66 million or 4%. Information Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily reflecting a $269 million or 3% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged product, and pre installed versions of Office in Japan, a $91 million or 6% increase in OEM revenue, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by reduced Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005, offset by a $663 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Information Worker operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by a $283 million or 15% increase in sales and marketing expenses related to supporting field sales efforts and a $71 million or 10% increase in research and development expenses. Headcount related costs increased 14% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount related to supporting field sales efforts and research and development investments in future products and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Information Worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a $304 million decrease in stock based compensation expense. Operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of Office 2003. This decline was offset by an increase in headcount related costs as a result of an increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. PAGE 25 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Microsoft Business Solutions (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 919 $ 784 $ 742 17% 6% Operating income (loss) $ 24 $ (171 ) $ (291 ) * 41% * Not meaningful Microsoft Business Solutions provides business management software solutions targeted to businesses of varying sizes. The main products consist of enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, customer relationship management (CRM) software, retail solutions, Microsoft Partner Program (MSPP), and related services. Microsoft Business Solutions also includes the Small and Mid market Solutions and Partners (SMS&P), which focuses on sales to customers and partners in the small and mid market customer segments. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide services and local support. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 driven by new users for Microsoft CRM and existing Dynamics ERP customers purchasing functionality and user licenses. The increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to 10% revenue growth in software partially offset by 25% decline in services revenue. The software revenue increase was driven by 9% growth in license revenue and 16% growth in enhancement revenue and was attributed to growth in ERP and CRM solutions and an increase in MSPP subscriptions. Microsoft Business Solutions operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in revenue accompanied by a $56 million decrease in sales and marketing expense as a result of decreased net SMS&P spending. Headcount related costs increased 3% reflecting both a 10% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a $175 million decline in stock based compensation expense, an increase in product revenue, and a decline in amortization of acquired intangibles. The reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental costs in the SMS&P organization. In addition, we increased our marketing and product development spending in our ERP and CRM portfolios. MSN (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 2,298 $ 2,344 $ 2,270 (2)% 3% Operating income (loss) $ (77 ) $ 412 $ 98 * 320% * Not meaningful MSN includes personal communications services, such as e mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. In fiscal year 2006, we launched MSN adCenter our internally developed advertising platform in certain international markets and throughout the U.S. where it now serves 100 percent of paid search traffic on our online properties. We believe MSN adCenter will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenues by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded PAGE 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. We announced in fiscal year 2006, Windows Live, a set of Internet services and software designed to improve the users connected experience, including Windows Live Local and Windows Live Messenger. MSN revenue decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $195 million or 28% decline in access revenue, partially offset by a $126 million or 9% increase in advertising revenue and a $23 million or 9% increase in revenue from subscription and transaction services other than access. As of June 30, 2006, MSN had 2.1 million access subscribers compared with 2.7 million at June 30, 2005. In addition, MSN had over 261 million active Hotmail accounts and over 243 million active Messenger accounts as of June 30, 2006. The increase in advertising revenue reflects growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the transition to adCenter. In fiscal year 2005, MSN revenue increased reflecting $193 million or 16% growth in advertising revenue primarily as a result of industry and market growth and continued growth of MSN display advertising revenue and $84 million or 88% growth in subscription and transaction services revenue. These increases were partially offset by the search clarity in advertising program, the impact of the homepage redesign, and a decline of $219 million or 24% in access revenue, driven by the continued migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. MSN operating income decreased in fiscal year 2006 due to a $230 million or 39% increase in research and development costs, a $126 million or 22% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $67 million or 9% increase in cost of revenue as we continue to invest in MSN adCenter, Windows Live, and other new platforms. Headcount related costs increased 25% reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation. In fiscal year 2005, MSN operating income increased mainly due to a $241 million decrease in stock based compensation expense, reduced costs associated with the Internet Access business, and increased advertising and subscription revenue. Partially offsetting the decreased expenses were increased headcount related costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Mobile and Embedded Devices (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 377 $ 262 $ 193 44% 36% Operating income (loss) $ 2 $ (65 ) $ (237 ) * 73% * Not meaningful Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to unit volume increases in major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for phone enabled devices, partially offset by a decline in shipments for stand alone PDAs. In fiscal year 2006, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $55 million or 37% while revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $49 million or 47%, which was primarily due to the product being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. Unit volume increases in major product lines drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal PAGE 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 year 2004, primarily driven by increased market demand for phone enabled devices, and increased growth in shipments for standalone PDAs. In fiscal year 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $46 million or 45% and revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $19 million or 21%. Unit volume increases in major product lines drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004, primarily driven by increased market demand for phone enabled devices, and increased growth in shipments for standalone PDAs. Mobile and Embedded Devices generated operating income for fiscal year 2006 as opposed to the operating loss in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by a $42 million or 21% increase in both research and development and general and administrative expenses. Headcount related costs increased 15% reflecting both a 24% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. The operating loss for fiscal year 2005 decreased compared to fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a $95 million decrease in stock based compensation, as well as the growth in revenue and a decrease in sales and marketing expense. This improvement was partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased headcount, and increased investment in research and development. Home and Entertainment (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 4,256 $ 3,140 $ 2,737 36% 15% Operating loss $ (1,262 ) $ (485 ) $ (1,337 ) (160)% 64% Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, CPxG (consumer software and hardware products), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. Our Xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the Xbox 360, which launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We believe that the functionality of our new console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well positioned relative to forthcoming competitive consoles. We also believe launching in advance of competitive consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long term success of Xbox 360. Revenue from the first generation of Xbox products has declined and is expected to continue to decline as a result of the introduction of Xbox 360. Home and Entertainment revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the launch of the Xbox 360 console partially offset by a decline in first party Xbox game sales primarily resulting from the significant impact of Halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. We sold approximately 5 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2006. The revenue growth was also attributable to $140 million or 15% growth from our other product lines, primarily as a result of an increase in PC games sales due to significant new game releases, especially Age of Empires III, and an increase in MSTV revenue due to deployments in fiscal year 2006. Revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to significant new product launches, which resulted in a $416 million or 23% increase in Xbox revenue. Halo 2 was introduced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and generated over $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2005. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms declined $50 million or 5% compared to fiscal year 2004 due to lower PC games software sales. Home and Entertainment operating loss increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily as a result of a $1.64 billion increase in cost of revenue resulting from the number of Xbox 360 consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs, partially offset by the revenue growth. Our fiscal year 2006 operating loss increased due to the significant impact of Halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. Headcount related costs increased 5% reflecting both a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. The fiscal year 2005 operating loss decreased primarily due to an increase in high margin Xbox software sales, lower Xbox console units costs, a $90 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment recorded in fiscal year 2004, and a $219 million decrease in stock based compensation expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with Xbox 360 console development and related launch efforts. PAGE 28 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Corporate Level Activity (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Corporate level expenses $ 5,026 $ 5,910 $ 6,871 (15 )% (14 )% Certain corporate level expenses are not allocated to our segments. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies. Corporate level expenses decreased in fiscal year 2006, primarily reflecting a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by an $84 million increase in headcount related costs. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 including settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, and the 281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission in July 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft, as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during the prior year primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc., Gateway, IBM, and other antitrust and competition law matters. Headcount related costs increased 5% during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation. Corporate level expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005, primarily as a result of a $736 million reduction in stock based compensation expense and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. In fiscal year 2005, we recognized $2.31 billion in legal charges as compared to $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2004 which included a $1.92 billion charge for a settlement with the Sun Microsystems, Inc., and the fine of 497 million ($605 million) imposed by the European Commission. Change to Financial Reporting Structure On July 17, 2006, we announced that effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, we will report our businesses under five operating segments, reflecting completion of the previously announced changes in our organizational structure and how we will manage our business beginning in fiscal year 2007. Each of the five segments will be organized under one of the three operating divisions announced earlier in fiscal year 2006: Platforms and Services Division Microsoft Business Division Entertainment and Devices Division The five operating segments are described below. The first three of these will comprise the Platforms and Services Division. Client will include the former Client segment. Products will include Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools will include the former Server and Tools segment, excluding the Exchange Server business and certain client access licenses related to products residing in the Microsoft Business Division. Products will include the Windows Server operating system, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Consulting Services, product support services, Visual Studio, System Center products, the Forefront security family of products, and Biz Talk Server, among others. Online Services Business will include the former MSN segment and Windows Live. Products will include MSN Search, MapPoint, MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services, MSN Mobile Services, and Windows Live. Microsoft Business Division will include the former Information Worker and Microsoft Business Solutions segments, as well as the Exchange Server business and certain client access licenses, formerly included in the Server and Tools segment. Products will include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CAL, Microsoft Live Meeting, One Note, Office Communication Server, Microsoft Dynamics AX, Microsoft PAGE 29 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Dynamics GP, Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Microsoft Dynamics SL, Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System, Microsoft Partner Program, and Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting. Entertainment and Devices Division will include the former Home and Entertainment and Mobile and Embedded Devices segments. Products will include Xbox 360, Xbox, Xbox Live, CPxG (consumer software and hardware products), IPTV, Windows Mobile software platform, Windows Embedded device operating system, and Windows Automotive. Our historical results under this new segmentation for the four quarters in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Revenue For the quarter ended For the quarter ended (In millions) September 30,2005 December 31,2005 March 31,2006 June 30,2006 Fiscal Year2006 September 30,2004 December 31,2004 March 31,2005 June 30,2005 Fiscal Year2005 Segments Client $ 3,187 $ 3,459 $ 3,187 $ 3,376 $ 13,209 $ 2,980 $ 3,193 $ 2,964 $ 3,014 $ 12,151 Server and Tools 2,127 2,438 2,398 2,690 9,653 1,906 2,161 2,058 2,245 8,370 Online Services Business 564 594 561 580 2,299 559 606 581 598 2,344 Microsoft Business Division 3,283 3,689 3,608 3,908 14,488 3,086 3,413 3,384 3,637 13,520 Entertainment and Devices 580 1,657 1,146 1,250 4,633 658 1,445 633 667 3,403 Total revenue $ 9,741 $ 11,837 $ 10,900 $ 11,804 $ 44,282 $ 9,189 $ 10,818 $ 9,620 $ 10,161 $ 39,788 Operating Income / (Loss) For the quarter ended For the quarter ended (In millions) September 30,2005 December 31,2005 March 31, 2006 June 30, 2006 Fiscal Year2006 September 30,2004 December 31,2004 March 31, 2005 June 30, 2005 Fiscal Year2005 Segments Client $ 2,569 $ 2,638 $ 2,471 $ 2,504 $ 10,182 $ 2,387 $ 2,513 $ 2,331 $ 2,172 $ 9,403 Server and Tools 606 762 746 903 3,017 455 660 515 479 2,109 Online Services Business 81 58 (26 ) (190 ) (77 ) 79 130 101 101 411 Microsoft Business Division 2,251 2,466 2,414 2,544 9,675 2,160 2,355 2,316 2,285 9,116 Entertainment and Devices (182 ) (296 ) (422 ) (437 ) (1,337 ) (202 ) 28 (198 ) (235 ) (607 ) Corporate Level Activity (1,279 ) (971 ) (1,295 ) (1,443 ) (4,988 ) (1,385 ) (937 ) (1,736 ) (1,813 ) (5,871 ) Total operating income $ 4,046 $ 4,657 $ 3,888 $ 3,881 $ 16,472 $ 3,494 $ 4,749 $ 3,329 $ 2,989 $ 14,561 Our outlook for fiscal year 2007 based on the five operating segments is as follows: Client We expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to our upcoming launch of Windows Vista. We expect revenue generated from OEMs to grow slower than the PC hardware market due to increased concentration among larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets. We expect PC shipments to grow 8% to 10% for fiscal year 2007. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. Server and Tools We expect continued momentum from recent product launches and the expansion of our products in security, management and designer tools will help drive our overall revenue growth in fiscal year 2007. We estimate overall server hardware unit shipments will grow 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2007. However, we face competition from Linux based, Unix, and other server operating systems as well as competition in server applications. PAGE 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Online Services Business We expect increased growth in display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising industry continues to expand. Our search revenue is expected to grow in fiscal year 2007 as a result of continued ramp up of adCenter. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue to decline in fiscal year 2007. Microsoft Business Division We expect Microsoft Business Division revenue to grow in fiscal year 2007. We feel that our customers continued preference to purchase annuity contracts indicates enthusiasm for the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We also expect continued demand for our Dynamics products, building on the fiscal 2006 momentum. Entertainment and Devices Division We expect revenue to increase from fiscal year 2006 due to the increased availability of the Xbox 360 console unit during the entire fiscal year, including the second holiday season after the launch in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2007, we expect to introduce a music and entertainment device, the first in a new family of hardware and software products for the consumer market. The availability of a commercial IPTV product is expected to drive significant growth in MSTV revenue across several geographies. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. Xbox 360 console unit costs are expected to decline. As we implement our long term growth strategy, we expect to increase our level of spending in four key areas in fiscal year 2007: increased product costs associated with Xbox consoles; marketing and field sales spending including launch costs; quickening the pace of development in growth areas such as business intelligence, security, management and unified communications (including acquisitions); and increased costs to execute on our online services strategy. While these investments will translate into increased operating expenses in fiscal year 2007, we believe they will help lay the groundwork for future growth and profitability. Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Cost of revenue $ 7,650 $ 6,031 $ 6,596 27% (9)% As a percent of revenue 17% 15% 18% 2ppt (3)ppt Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue in fiscal year 2006 increased mainly due to a $1.64 billion increase in Home and Entertainment as a result of an increase in the number of total Xbox consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs. Cost of revenue in fiscal year 2005 decreased due to a $363 million decrease in stock based compensation expense, a $140 million reduction in costs associated with a decrease in the MSN Internet Access subscriber base, and a $169 million reduction in other product costs mainly due to Xbox consoles cost efficiency, partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services costs. Research and Development (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Research and development $ 6,584 $ 6,097 $ 7,735 8% (21)% As a percent of revenue 15% 15% 21% ppt (6)ppt Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock based compensation expense, and other headcount related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also PAGE 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 include third party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased development costs associated with new and upcoming offerings such as MSN adCenter, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Windows Vista, Xbox 360, and corporate research activities. Headcount related costs increased 3% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 17% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to a $1.88 billion decrease in stock based compensation expense. This expense decline was partially offset by increased headcount and product development costs associated with the Xbox 360 console and related games, SQL Server 2005, Windows Vista, and product development in Mobile and Embedded Devices. Sales and Marketing (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Sales and marketing $ 9,818 $ 8,563 $ 8,195 15% 4% As a percent of revenue 22% 22% 22% ppt ppt Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock based compensation expense and other headcount related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased headcount related costs, investments in partner marketing and product launch related spending. Headcount related costs increased 13% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 20% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. For fiscal year 2005, sales and marketing expense increased slightly due to $470 million higher headcount related costs from increased headcount and general salary increases; higher sales and marketing costs driven by product planning, reseller marketing, and advertising campaign costs mainly related to launch of the Start Something campaign; launch of Halo 2; and launch arrangements for Xbox 360. The increase was offset mainly by a $660 million decrease in stock based compensation expense. General and Administrative (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 General and administrative $ 3,758 $ 4,536 $ 5,275 17% 14% As a percent of revenue 8% 11% 14% (3)ppt (3)ppt General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock based compensation expense and other headcount related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during fiscal year 2005. Headcount related costs increased 7% during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. General and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2005 primarily reflecting decreased stock based compensation expense and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. In fiscal year 2005, we recognized $277 million of stock based compensation expense as compared to $664 million in fiscal year 2004. In fiscal year 2005, we recognized $2.31 billion in legal charges as compared to $2.83 billion in fiscal year 2004. PAGE 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Investment Income and Other The components of investment income and other were as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Dividends and interest $ 1,510 $ 1,460 $ 1,892 Net gains on investments 161 856 1,563 Net losses on derivatives (99 ) (262 ) (268 ) Income/(losses) from equity investees and other 218 13 (25 ) Investment income and other $ 1,790 $ 2,067 $ 3,162 For fiscal year 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004, and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006. Dividends and interest income declined $432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes in preparation for the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004, and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend. For fiscal year 2006, net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments, net losses on sales of fixed income investments and other than temporary impairments on both equity and fixed income investments. Net recognized gains decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed income investments, higher other than temporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in the current period as compared to fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2006, other than temporary impairments were $408 million, as compared to $152 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in other than temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on July 20, 2006. Net gains on investments declined $707 million in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on December 2, 2004. Net gains on investments also include other than temporary impairments of $152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $82 million in fiscal year 2004. Net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to enhance investment income. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net losses on derivatives were as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net gain/(losses) on equity derivatives $ 192 $ (202 ) $ 118 Net gains on commodity derivatives 101 46 Net losses on interest rate derivatives (79 ) (53 ) (102 ) Net losses on foreign currency contracts (313 ) (53 ) (284 ) Net losses on derivatives $ (99 ) $ (262 ) $ (268 ) During fiscal year 2006, we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on non designated equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to net losses in the prior PAGE 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 fiscal year and higher net gains on commodity positions in the current fiscal year driven by increases in the related commodity indices. These gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts. The net gains on equity derivatives during fiscal year 2006 are primarily due to changes in the market value of non designated equity derivatives. Gains and losses arising from non designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income Net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. During fiscal year 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $53 million. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $53 million, related to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income. Net losses on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. Gains on commodity positions were $46 million during fiscal year 2005. Derivative losses were $268 million in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we entered into an agreement with NBC Universal, Inc. (NBC) that restructured our joint venture relationships for MSNBC Cable L.L.C. (CJV) and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. (IJV). As a result, we divested 32% of CJV for $331 million and NBC acquired the right, exercisable in the following two years, to buy the remaining 18% interest. In addition, we modified our agreement with NBC to grant to IJV a U.S. content license and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both NBC and Microsoft for local and non U.S. news content. As part of the MSNBC restructuring agreements, we paid a $200 million fee to effectively terminate IJVs prior content license agreement and we also prepaid the remaining $14 million license fee to NBC. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, NBC exercised its option to buy our remaining 18% interest in CJV. For fiscal year 2006, we recognized a net gain of $195 million related to the above transactions. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 31% as compared to 26% for fiscal year 2005. During fiscal year 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits. The increased rate in fiscal year 2006 resulted primarily from the European Commission fine of 281 million ($351 million) which is not tax deductible, and a lower rate in fiscal year 2005 as a result of reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an Internal Revenue Service examination for fiscal year 1997 1999 and a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2004 was 33%. Financial Condition Cash and equivalents and short term investments totaled $34.16 billion and $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2006, and 2005, respectively. This investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. Equity and other investments were $9.23 billion and $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $18.90 billion at June 30, 2006. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position. PAGE 34 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, advertising, and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006, increased $1.74 billion from June 30, 2005, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $1.66 billion, a $53 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $127 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services. The following table outlines the expected recognition of $10.9 billion of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006: (In millions) Recognition ofUnearned Revenue Three months ended: September 30, 2006 $ 3,483 December 31, 2006 2,687 March 31, 2007 1,899 June 30, 2007 1,069 Thereafter 1,764 Unearned revenue $ 10,902 Cash Flows Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2006 decreased 13% to $14.40 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a $987 million increase in inventory and product costs related to Xbox 360 and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16% growth in headcount. These factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11% revenue growth and $1.74 billion increase in unearned revenue. Cash used in financing was $20.56 billion in fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $20.52 billion from the previous year driven by a $32.57 billion reduction in cash dividend payments. This impact was partially offset by an $11.15 billion increase in common stock repurchases. Net cash from investing was $8.00 billion in fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $7.02 billion from fiscal year 2005 driven primarily by an $8.93 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase, sales, and maturities of investments and a $766 million increase in additions to property and equipment. These factors were partially offset by $3.12 billion of cash proceeds from our securities lending program. Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14% to $16.61 billion primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8% revenue growth combined with a 12% increase in unearned revenue. Cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately $1.8 billion lower than in the previous year, adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7% increase in full time employees. Cash used for financing was $41.08 billion in fiscal year 2005, driven by $36.11 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1.73 billion paid in fiscal year 2004. The increase was also partially driven by $8.06 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases, an increase of $4.67 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year, reflecting 312 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005, an increase of 188.5 million shares compared to the previous year. Net cash from investing was $15.03 billion in fiscal year 2005, an increase of $18.37 billion from fiscal year 2004, primarily due to a $23.59 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by a $5.32 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity. PAGE 35 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. The decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the European Commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. Cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the previous year. The decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. We repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004. Cash used for investing was $3.34 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $3.88 billion from fiscal year 2003. We have no material long term debt. Stockholders equity at June 30, 2006, was $40.10 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $234 million on June 30, 2006. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $276 million, $299 million, and $331 million fiscal year 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. In fiscal year 2006, our Board of Directors declared $0.35 per share cash dividends, with $2.69 billion paid as of June 30, 2006. A quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share (or $906 million) was declared by our Board of Directors on June 21, 2006 to be paid to shareholders of record as of August 17, 2006, on September 14, 2006. On July 20, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our Board of Directors on July 20, 2004 to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft common stock. The repurchases were made using our cash resources. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754 million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under this plan. On July 20, 2006, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized new share repurchase programs, comprised of a $20 billion tender offer which was completed on August 17, 2006, and an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 1.5% of the common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the ongoing share repurchase program, previously announced on July 20, 2006, had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, the company is authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. We believe existing cash and short term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the PAGE 36 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2006: (In millions)(1) Payments due by period Fiscal Years 2007 2008 2010 2011 2013 2014 andthereafter Total Long term debt $ $ $ $ $ Construction commitments(2)(4) 234 234 Lease obligations: Capital leases Operating leases(3) 250 436 158 41 885 Purchase commitments(4) 2,219 9 2,228 Other long term liabilities(5) 4 66 1 71 Total contractual obligations $ 2,707 $ 511 $ 159 $ 41 $ 3,418 (1) We have excluded the $970 million long term contingent liability related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits referred to in Note 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements as the timing and amount to be resolved in cash versus vouchers is subject to uncertainty. (2) We have certain commitments for the construction of buildings. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (3) Our future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases comprise the majority of the operating lease obligations presented above. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (4) The amount presented above as purchase and construction commitments includes all known open purchase orders and all known contracts that are take or pay contracts. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and our cash flows from operations. (5) We have excluded other obligations of $5.22 billion from other long term liabilities presented above as the amount that will be settled in cash is not known. We have also excluded unearned revenue of $1.76 billion. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) FAS123(R) 3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. This FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An entity that adopts SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may make a one time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP. An entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election. We elected to adopt the transition method as described in the FSP as of July 1, 2005. This method change did not have an impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50% probability threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. We are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our financial statements. PAGE 37 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43. EITF Issue No. 06 2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06 2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock based compensation. We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97 2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the products estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SEC SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. PAGE 38 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material, and accordingly, we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. PAGE 39 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Statement of Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and managements report on its assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors and our independent auditors to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Steven A. Ballmer Chief Executive Officer Christopher P.

Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer PAGE 40 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed income, equity, and commodity price risks. A portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position. We hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed income securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk. The portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. However, we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. Commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk. We use a value at risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed income security prices revert to maturity value over time. VaR is calculated by computing the exposures of each holdings market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. The exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. The VaR is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. We hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars. In these arrangements, we hedge a securitys equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the securitys appreciation above the sold call strike, in exchange for the premium received for the sold call. We also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. We have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods. At the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006, we changed the methodology we use to calculate VaR. We previously used a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology to calculate VaR. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we adopted a factor based parametric methodology. The factor based parametric methodology can be performed more frequently (resulting in more timely data), divides the aggregated VaR into its component risk factor groups, and is incrementally more accurate than the previously used simulation based methodology in evaluating diversification effects of commodity risk factors and interactions between equity and currency factors. While we believe the efficiencies gained by changing to the parametric methodology are significant, we do not believe this methodology produces results that are significantly different from the simulation based methodology. The VaR amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. Losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VaR by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the VaR analysis. VaR amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. VaR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. These VaR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. We use historical data to estimate VaR. Given the reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation in VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. PAGE 41 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A The following table sets forth the one day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006: (In millions) Year ended June 30, 2006 Risk Categories 2006 2005 Average High Low Interest rates $ 66 $ 88 $ 82 $ 127 $ 62 Currency rates 91 52 33 91 11 Equity prices 88 164 116 168 84 Commodity prices 12 14 15 18 12 Total one day VaR for the combined risk categories was $158 million at June 30, 2006 and $195 million at June 30, 2005. The total VaR is 38% less at June 30, 2006 and 39% less at June, 30 2005 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.
