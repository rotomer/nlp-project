ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2007, 2006, AND 2005 OVERVIEW The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (Notes). We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals, channels around the world, and through our search products. Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. In fiscal year 2007, our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of $1.67 billion of revenue previously deferred from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system when those products became available to consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. With the exception of fiscal year 2007, we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future. We intend to sustain the long term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security, and value of Windows operating systems and to develop operating system versions targeted at emerging markets. We also are increasing our focus on selling our products in emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software used in those markets. In addition, we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing software that is easiest to deploy and manage, and that is most secure with the lowest total cost of ownership. We continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business, including business solutions, mobile computing, communication, entertainment, and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth. We also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products. We believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. We believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long term growth by delivering innovative products, creating opportunities for partners, improving customer satisfaction with key audiences, and improving our internal business processes. Our focus in fiscal year 2008 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas, including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform, responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and continuing to focus internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. Key market opportunities include: Consumer technology. We are focused on delivering consumer software products that we believe are compelling in terms of design and features. We are also working to define the next era of consumer electronics through innovating software that powers todays consumer devices. PAGE 20 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Software plus services. The ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the Internet represents an opportunity across every one of our businesses. We believe our software plus services approach will enable us to deliver new experiences to end users and new value to businesses. Expanding our presence on the desktop and server. Through our ability to deliver additional value in security, messaging, systems management, and collaboration, and new technology for high performance computing, unified communications, healthcare, and business intelligence, we believe we are well positioned to build on our strength with businesses of all sizes. The expansion of our Unlimited Potential program provides the foundation for our efforts to reach the five billion people around the globe who do not have access to PCs and digital technology today. Summary of Results for Fiscal Years 2007, 2006, and 2005 (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Revenue $ 51,122 $ 44,282 $ 39,788 15% 11% Operating income $ 18,524 $ 16,472 $ 14,561 12% 13% Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 Revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Windows Vista, increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio, and increased Xbox 360 console sales. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated revenue during the year. Operating income growth was driven primarily by the increased revenue and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated with Xbox 360 and Windows Vista, increased OSB data centers costs, and increased sales and marketing expenses. In July 2007, we expanded our global Xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. As a result, we recorded a $1.06 billion charge for anticipated costs under the warranty policy, inventory write downs, and product returns. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount related costs and marketing costs related to recent product launches. Headcount related costs increased 15%, driven by a 10% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 Revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in SQL Server following the launch of SQL Server 2005 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, Windows Server and other server applications, increased Xbox revenue resulting from the Xbox 360 launch in November 2005, growth in licensing of Windows PC operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other MBD software. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year. Operating income increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue primarily related to Xbox 360 and an increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch related spending. Headcount related costs increased 7%, driven by an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16% growth in headcount. Fiscal Year 2008 Outlook Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. We expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2008. We also expect continued double digit revenue growth. Given our product launches in the second half of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half of fiscal year 2008 than in the second half. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow between 9% and 11%. We do not expect a significant PAGE 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 impact from changes in year over year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2008. We expect our operating income growth rate to exceed our revenue growth rate. SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) In July 2006, we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting previously announced reorganizations. We have five operating segments: Client, Server and Tools, the Online Services Business, the Microsoft Business Division, and the Entertainment and Devices Division. Prior fiscal year information has been recast to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal year 2007. The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. The segment information appearing in Note 18 Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) is presented on a basis consistent with the Companys internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is analyzed separately. Client (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Revenue $ 14,972 $ 13,089 $ 12,042 14% 9% Operating income $ 11,603 $ 10,297 $ 9,442 13% 9% Client offerings consist of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, XP Media Center Edition, XP Tablet PC Edition, Vista Business, Vista Home Premium, and Vista Ultimate. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Basic. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (OEM premium mix), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders. Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 Client revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista. OEM revenue increased $1.46 billion or 13% driven by 13% growth in OEM license units while revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $422 million or 21%. During the year, the OEM Premium Mix increased 16 percentage points to 68%. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 10% to 12% driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets. Client operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue and decreased research and development costs, partially offset by increased Windows Vista product costs and increased sales and marketing expenses for launch related programs. The decrease in research and development costs reflects the capitalization of certain Windows Vista software development costs and completion of product development on Windows Vista. Headcount related costs decreased 3%, driven by a 1% decrease in headcount and a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 Client revenue increased reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in OEM revenue driven by 17% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. During the year, the OEM premium mix increased two percentage points to 52%. OEM revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of PAGE 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 our billings associated with OEM distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other Microsoft channels. Client operating income increased reflecting the increase in OEM revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and Windows Vista pre launch programs. Headcount related costs increased 6%, driven by a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Server and Tools (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Revenue $ 11,175 $ 9,652 $ 8,367 16% 15% Operating income $ 3,900 $ 3,035 $ 2,072 29% 46% Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (CAL) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one time licenses and as multi year volume licenses. Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training, and certification revenue increased $1.12 billion or 14%. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server which grew over 20%. Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue increased $404 million or 24% primarily due to higher demand for Premier services in corporate enterprises. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $165 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue. Server and Tools operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by growth in headcount related costs and cost of revenue for services. Headcount related costs increased 12%, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Cost of revenue increased $243 million or 13% reflecting growth in services provided. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 Server and Tools revenue increased mainly driven by growth in SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio. SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. Server and Server applications revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training and certification revenue increased $1.07 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 30% for the year. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $217 million or 15% primarily due to higher demand for services. Server and Tools operating income increased primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to supporting long term strategies and the launches of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Headcount related costs increased 5%, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. PAGE 23 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Online Services Business (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Revenue $ 2,474 $ 2,299 $ 2,344 8% (2)% Operating income (loss) $ (732 ) $ (74 ) $ 402 * * * Not meaningful The Online Services Business (OSB) provides personal communications services, such as e mail and instant messaging, online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services and OneCare. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. We have transitioned to adCenter, our own platform, for online delivery of advertising in the U.S. and certain international markets. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. In fiscal year 2007, we launched Windows Live Search and Live.com in 54 international markets, Live Local Search in the U.S. and U.K., beta versions of MSN Soapbox (our expansion of the MSN Video experience), Virtual Earth 3D, Windows Live Hotmail, and other offerings. Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 OSB revenue increased driven primarily by advertising revenue which grew $314 million or 21% to $1.84 billion. This increase was primarily due to growth in advertising for search, home page, email, and messaging services. The increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a $156 million or 31% decrease in access revenue. At June 30, 2007, we estimate that OSB had over 310 million active Hotmail accounts and over 280 million Messenger accounts. OSB operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue which grew $352 million or 45% and increased headcount related costs as a result of continued search and advertising platform investments. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and royalties. Headcount related costs increased 30%, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 OSB revenue decreased primarily reflecting a $195 million or 28% decline in access revenue, partially offset by a $126 million or 9% increase in advertising revenue and a $23 million or 9% increase in revenue from subscription and transaction services other than access. Advertising revenue for fiscal year 2006 was $1.52 billion. The increase in advertising revenue reflects growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the transition to adCenter. As of June 30, 2006, OSB had 2.1 million access subscribers compared with 2.7 million at June 30, 2005. In addition, OSB had over 261 million active Hotmail accounts and over 243 million active Messenger accounts as of June 30, 2006. OSB operating income decreased due to a $230 million or 39% increase in research and development costs, a $126 million or 22% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $67 million or 9% increase in cost of revenue as we continued to invest in adCenter, Windows Live, and other new platforms. Headcount related costs increased 25%, reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation. PAGE 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Microsoft Business Division (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Revenue $ 16,396 $ 14,486 $ 13,520 13% 7% Operating income $ 10,838 $ 9,620 $ 9,116 13% 6% MBD offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts business revenue which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue, and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales, OEM revenue, and sales of pre installed versions of Office in Japan. Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Revenue from consumer sales increased $371 million or 11% while revenue from business sales increased $1.54 billion or 14%. The increase in business revenue includes a 21% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $248 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue. MBD operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue primarily associated with the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects increased headcount related expenses, increased sales support costs from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners, and increased launch related marketing expenses. Headcount related costs increased 10%, driven by a 6% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock based compensation expense. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 MBD revenue increased reflecting an increase in business sales of $1.01 billion or 10%, partially offset by a decrease in consumer sales of $44 million or 1%. The increase in business sales reflects a 16% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. MBD operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to supporting field sales efforts and increased research and development expenses. Headcount related costs increased 8%, driven by a 14% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock based compensation expense. PAGE 25 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Entertainment and Devices Division (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Revenue $ 6,083 $ 4,756 $ 3,515 28% 35% Operating loss $ (1,892 ) $ (1,284 ) $ (539 ) (47)% (138)% The Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD) products include the Xbox video game system; PC games; consumer software and hardware products; the Zune digital music and entertainment device; Mediaroom, our Internet protocol television software; and Mobile and Embedded devices (Windows Mobile software platform, Windows Embedded device operating system and Windows Automotive). The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation and quality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well positioned relative to recently launched competitive consoles. Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 EDD revenue increased primarily due to increased Xbox 360 console sales, Zune sales, and increased Xbox accessories and video game sales. We shipped 6.6 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2007 as compared to 5.0 million consoles during fiscal year 2006. Xbox and PC game revenue increased $650 million or 19% as a result of increased Xbox 360 platform sales, partially offset by decreased sales of the first generation Xbox console and related accessories and video games. Zune, which was launched in November 2006, consumer hardware and software, and TV platforms revenue increased $539 million or 65%. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $138 million or 28% driven by sales growth in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems. EDD operating loss increased primarily due to the $1.06 billion Xbox 360 charge recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and Zune launch related expenses. The increase in operating loss was partially offset by increased Xbox 360 platform sales and decreased Xbox 360 console manufacturing costs. Headcount related costs increased 15%, driven by a 9% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 EDD revenue increased primarily due to the launch of the Xbox 360 console in November 2005, partially offset by a decline in first party Xbox game sales primarily resulting from the significant impact of Halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. The revenue growth was also attributable to $140 million or 15% growth from our other product lines, primarily as a result of an increase in PC games sales due to significant new game releases, especially Age of Empires III, and an increase in TV platform revenue due to deployments in fiscal year 2006. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $115 million or 44% driven by unit volume increases in major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. EDD operating loss increased primarily as a result of a $1.64 billion increase in cost of revenue resulting from the number of Xbox 360 consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs, partially offset by the revenue growth. The significant impact of Halo 2 in fiscal year 2005 also contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2006 operating loss. Headcount related costs increased 8%, driven by a 21% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. PAGE 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Corporate Level Activity (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 Corporate level activity $ (5,193 ) $ (5,122 ) $ (5,932 ) (1)% 14% Certain corporate level results are not allocated to our segments. Those results include expenses related to corporate operations associated with broad based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies. Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 Corporate level expenses increased primarily driven by increased headcount related costs offset by decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. Headcount related costs increased 25%, driven by a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. We incurred $511 million in legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2007, primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 which included settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, a 281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission in July 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft, and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 Corporate level expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by increased headcount related costs. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during fiscal year 2005 primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc., Gateway, IBM, and other antitrust and competition law matters. Headcount related costs increased 5%, driven by a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation. Outlook Our outlook for fiscal year 2008 is as follows: Client We expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to increased acceptance of Windows Vista. We expect PC shipments to grow 9% to 11% for fiscal year 2008. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. Server and Tools We expect continued momentum from recent product launches and to benefit from the upcoming launches of the new versions of SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio in the second half of fiscal year 2008. Online Services Business We expect increased growth in online advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising industry continues to expand. In May 2007, we agreed to acquire aQuantive, Inc., a digital marketing company, for approximately $6 billion in cash. We expect to complete this transaction in August 2007. This acquisition will enable us to strengthen relationships with advertisers, agencies and publishers by enhancing our advertising platforms and services. The acquisition also provides us with increased depth in building and supporting next generation advertising solutions and environments such as cross media planning and video on demand. Microsoft Business Division We expect revenue to continue to increase in fiscal year 2008 due to increased customer acceptance of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We continue to develop plans to grow revenue in new areas such as unified communications, enterprise content management, collaboration tools, business intelligence, and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products. PAGE 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Entertainment and Devices Division We expect revenue to increase due to the increased installed base of the Xbox 360 console and from the release of Halo 3, a new Xbox 360 game. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems.

Sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily because of increased headcount related costs, investments in partner marketing and product launch related spending. Headcount related costs increased 13% during fiscal year 2006, driven by a 20% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. General and Administrative (In millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 PercentChange 2007 versus 2006 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 General and administrative $ 3,329 $ 3,758 $ 4,536 (11)% (17)% As a percent of revenue 7% 8% 11% (1)ppt (3)ppt General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock based compensation expense and other headcount related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs decreased during fiscal year 2007 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased headcount related costs. During fiscal year 2007, we incurred $511 million of legal charges primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. as compared to $1.32 billion of legal charges in fiscal year 2006. Headcount related costs increased 15% during fiscal year 2007, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. General and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. During fiscal year 2006, we incurred $1.32 billion of legal charges primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. Legal charges in fiscal year 2006 also included settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. and the 281 million ($351 million) European Commission fine. Headcount related costs increased 7% during fiscal year 2006, driven by an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries for existing headcount. We incurred $2.31 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2005. PAGE 29 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Investment Income and Other The components of investment income and other were as follows: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Dividends and interest $ 1,319 $ 1,510 $ 1,460 Net gains on investments 650 161 856 Net losses on derivatives (358 ) (99 ) (262 ) Other, net (34 ) 218 13 Investment income and other $ 1,577 $ 1,790 $ 2,067 For fiscal year 2007, dividends and interest income declined, reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest bearing investments, partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments. For fiscal year 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004, and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006. For fiscal year 2007, net gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other than temporary impairments and gains on sales of fixed income investments in the current period as compared to losses in fiscal year 2006, partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments. Other than temporary impairments in fiscal year 2007 were not material and were $408 million in fiscal year 2006. Net gains on investments decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed income investments, higher other than temporary impairments, and fewer net gains on equity investments in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2006, other than temporary impairments were $408 million, as compared to $152 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in other than temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on July 20, 2006. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. We anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Derivative losses during fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. During fiscal year 2006, we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on non designated equity derivatives in fiscal 2006 as compared to net losses in fiscal 2005 and higher net gains on commodity positions in fiscal 2006 driven by increases in the related commodity indices. These gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts in fiscal 2006. Net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts, partly offset by gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. PAGE 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Other, net in fiscal year 2006 includes $195 million of gains that resulted from the restructuring of joint venture relationships between Microsoft and NBC related to MSNBC Cable L.L.C. and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 30%, 31%, and 26%, respectively. The fiscal year 2007 rate reflects a recurring effective tax rate of 31% offset by a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments. During fiscal year 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits and recorded a charge of 281 million ($351 million) from the European Commission fine which was not tax deductible. The 2005 tax rate was lower from the reversal of previously accrued taxes and from an IRS settlement. Financial Condition Cash and equivalents and short term investments totaled $23.41 billion and $34.16 billion as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Equity and other investments were $10.12 billion and $9.23 billion as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our investments consist primarily of fixed income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $29.46 billion at June 30, 2007. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solution products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, and TV platform for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2007: (In millions) Recognition ofUnearned Revenue Three months ended: September 30, 2007 $ 4,021 December 31, 2007 3,245 March 31, 2008 2,264 June 30, 2008 1,249 Thereafter 1,867 Unearned revenue $ 12,646 PAGE 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Cash Flows Fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 Cash flow from operations increased $3.39 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 15% revenue growth, along with a $1.64 billion decrease in cash outflow for other current assets primarily reflecting changes in inventory. Cash used for financing increased $3.98 billion. Several events occurred during fiscal year 2007 that affected cash used for financing. We issued $6.78 billion of common stock, including $3.25 billion related to 113 million call options exercised by JPMorgan in December 2006. We also completed our tender offer on August 17, 2006, which was included in the $27.58 billion of common stock repurchases. Cash from investing decreased $1.91 billion due to a $3.49 billion decline in securities lending activity where cash collateral is received from the counterparty along with $1.19 billion spent on acquisitions of companies and additions to property and equipment. These impacts were partially offset by a $2.77 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 Cash flow from operations decreased $2.20 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a $987 million increase in Xbox 360 inventory and product costs and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16% growth in headcount. These factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11% revenue growth and a $1.74 billion increase in unearned revenue. Cash used in financing decreased $20.52 billion driven by a $32.57 billion reduction in cash dividend payments. This impact was partially offset by an $11.15 billion increase in common stock repurchases. Net cash from investing decreased $7.02 billion driven primarily by an $8.93 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase, sales, and maturities of investments and a $766 million increase in additions to property and equipment. These factors were partially offset by $3.12 billion of net cash proceeds from our securities lending program. We have no material long term debt. Stockholders equity at June 30, 2007, was $31.10 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $821 million on June 30, 2007. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $326 million, $276 million, and $299 million in fiscal year 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. In May 2007, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase aQuantive, Inc. for approximately $6 billion in cash. We expect to complete this transaction in August 2007. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends: Declaration Date Per Share Dividend Record Date Total Amount Payment Date (in millions) (Fiscal year 2007) September 13, 2006 $ 0.10 November 16, 2006 $ 980 December 14, 2006 December 20, 2006 $ 0.10 February 15, 2007 $ 978 March 8, 2007 March 26, 2007 $ 0.10 May 17, 2007 $ 952 June 14, 2007 June 27, 2007 $ 0.10 August 16, 2007 $ 938 September 13, 2007 (Fiscal year 2006) September 23, 2005 $ 0.08 November 17, 2005 $ 846 December 8, 2005 December 14, 2005 $ 0.09 February 17, 2006 $ 926 March 9, 2006 March 27, 2006 $ 0.09 May 17, 2006 $ 916 June 8, 2006 June 21, 2006 $ 0.09 August 17,2006 $ 897 September 14, 2006 PAGE 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 On July 20, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our Board of Directors on July 20, 2004 to buy back up to $30.00 billion in Microsoft common stock. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754 million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under this plan. On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.00 billion tender offer, which was completed on August 17, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.84 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.16 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.16 billion through June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2007, approximately $15.14 billion remained of the $36.16 billion approved repurchase amount. We believe existing cash and equivalents and short term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. PAGE 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2007: (In millions)(1) Payments due by period Fiscal Years 2008 2009 2011 2012 2014 2015 andthereafter Total Long term debt $ $ $ $ $ Construction commitments(2)(4) 821 821 Lease obligations: Capital leases Operating leases(3) 349 618 258 116 1,341 Purchase commitments(4) 1,824 19 1,843 Other long term liabilities(5) 1 519 520 Total contractual obligations $ 2,995 $ 1,156 $ 258 $ 116 $ 4,525 (1) We have excluded the $768 million long term contingent liability related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits referred to in Note 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) as the timing and amount to be resolved in cash versus vouchers is subject to uncertainty. (2) We have certain commitments for the construction of buildings. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (3) Our future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases comprise the majority of the operating lease obligations presented above. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (4) The amount presented above as purchase and construction commitments includes all known open purchase orders and all known contracts that are take or pay contracts. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and our cash flows from operations. (5) We have excluded other obligations of $5.86 billion from other long term liabilities presented above as the amount that will be settled in cash is not known. We have also excluded non cash items of $71 million and unearned revenue of $1.87 billion. In May 2007, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with aQuantive, Inc. to acquire the company for approximately $6 billion in cash. As part of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we are required to pay $500 million if certain events occur that result in the merger not being completed. Due to the nature of this obligation, this amount has not been accrued for or included in the above schedule. The acquisition is expected to be completed in August 2007. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN No. 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. Based on our current assessment, the adoption of FIN No. 48 is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by $200 million to $400 million upon adoption. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43. EITF Issue No. 06 2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit PAGE 34 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06 2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements. In fiscal year 2007, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have an impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 157 would have on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial statements. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock based compensation. We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97 2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is PAGE 35 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. This is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. We determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. PAGE 36 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. PAGE 37 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Statement of Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and managements report on its assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors and our independent auditors to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Steven A. Ballmer Chief Executive Officer Christopher P.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed income, equity, and commodity price risks. A portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed income securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk. The portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. However, we use put call collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. Commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk. We use a value at risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed income security prices revert to maturity value over time. VaR is calculated by computing the exposures of each holdings market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. The exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. The VaR is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. We hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars. In these arrangements, we hedge a securitys equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the securitys appreciation above the sold call strike. We also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. We have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods. The VaR amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. Losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VaR by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the VaR analysis. VaR amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. VaR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. These VaR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. We use historical data to estimate VaR. Given the reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation in VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. The following table sets forth the one day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006: (In millions) Year ended June 30, 2007 Risk Categories June 30, 2007 June 30, 2006 Average High Low Interest rates $ 34 $ 66 $ 43 $ 67 $ 32 Currency rates 55 91 52 101 15 Equity prices 60 88 59 89 49 Commodity prices 7 12 7 12 4 Total one day VaR for the combined risk categories was $95 million at June 30, 2007 and $158 million at June 30, 2006. The total VaR is 39% less at June 30, 2007, and 38% less at June 30, 2006, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.
