ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (Notes). We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console and accessories, the Zune digital music and entertainment device and accessories, and Microsoft PC hardware products. Online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through Bing, Windows Live, Microsoft Office Web Apps, our MSN portals and channels, and to businesses through Microsoft Online Services offerings, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Online, Windows Azure, SQL Azure and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform. Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its annual segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding the deferral of revenue related to eligible sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the 2010 Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the Office 2010 Deferral) and sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of Windows 7 to original equipment manufacturers and retailers before general availability (the Windows 7 Deferral). Global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. The unfavorable global economic environment adversely affected our business in fiscal year 2009 as consumers and businesses cut back on spending, which reduced PC shipments and IT investments. During fiscal year 2010, the environment began to improve. However, the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and uncertain and are likely to remain so into 2011. Irrespective of global economic conditions, we are positive about our relative market position, our current product portfolio and future product pipeline. Because we offer a wide range of products and services that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs, including cloud based services, we believe that Microsoft is well positioned to create new opportunities to increase revenue as the global economy improves. We remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses. Technological innovation is the foundation of our long term growth and we intend to maintain our commitment to investment in research and development, engineering excellence, and delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners. We continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance information worker productivity, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid sized businesses. To sustain growth in the face of competition from other vendors of proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing software that is easiest to deploy and manage, and that is most secure with the lowest total cost of ownership. 22 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 In addition, we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business, including cloud computing, search, online solutions, business solutions, mobile computing, communication, entertainment, and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth. We also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products. We believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. This long term focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products, creating opportunities for partners, and improving customer satisfaction. Our focus in fiscal year 2011 is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform, by responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and by focusing internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. Summary of Results for Fiscal Years 2010, 2009, and 2008 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Revenue $ 62,484 $ 58,437 $ 60,420 7% (3)% Operating income $ 24,098 $ 20,363 $ 22,271 18% (9)% Diluted earnings per share $ 2.10 $ 1.62 $ 1.87 30% (13)% Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Revenue increased mainly due to strong sales of Windows 7, which was released during fiscal year 2010, and PC market improvement. Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $335 million or 3%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7 and Bing and increased sales force expenses related to Windows 7. General and administrative expenses increased $304 million or 8% due mainly to increased legal charges and transition expenses associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement, offset in part by a reduction in headcount related expenses. Cost of revenue increased $240 million or 2%, primarily reflecting increased online costs and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone, offset in part by decreased Xbox 360 console costs and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts. Research and development expenses decreased $296 million or 3%, primarily reflecting a decrease in third party development and programming costs and increased capitalization of certain software development costs. Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380 million shares during fiscal year 2010. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global PC market and the unfavorable economic environment. Primary factors contributing to the decline include the following: Revenue from Windows operating systems declined reflecting PC market weakness, especially PCs sold to businesses. Revenue from our Entertainment and Devices Division decreased across most lines of business including Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue which declined primarily as a result of decreased revenue per console due to price reductions during the prior 12 months, partially offset by increased console sales and Xbox LIVE revenue. 23 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 The above declines were partially offset by increased server and server application revenue, reflecting recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the Windows Server Platform and applications through SQL Server, Enterprise CAL Suites, and System Center products. Foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $486 million on revenue. Operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue. Operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcount related expenses, cost of revenue, and employee severance charges. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.4 billion or 28%, primarily due to decreased costs for legal settlements and contingencies. We incurred $283 million of legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $1.8 billion during the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. The prior year costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million). Sales and marketing expenses decreased $381 million or 3%, primarily driven by the resource management program. As part of that program, we reduced marketing and advertising expenses. Headcount related expenses, excluding $330 million of employee severance charges, increased 7%, driven by a 2% increase in headcount during the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Cost of revenue increased $557 million or 5%, primarily reflecting increased online costs, including online traffic acquisition, data center and equipment, and headcount related costs, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 platform costs. In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. As part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by June 30, 2010. During fiscal year 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount. Diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased net income, partially offset by share repurchases during the prior 12 months. We repurchased 318 million shares during fiscal year 2009. SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 22 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this MD&A to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving Windows Live from Online Services Division to Windows & Windows Live Division, and Razorfish from Online Services Division to Corporate. Razorfish was sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Windows & Windows Live Division (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Revenue $ 18,491 $ 14,974 $ 17,211 23% (13)% Operating income $ 12,977 $ 9,982 $ 12,422 30% (20)% 24 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Windows & Windows Live Division (Windows Division) offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems and online software and services through Windows Live. Premium Windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, and Windows Vista Enterprise. Standard editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows Vista Starter, Windows Vista Home Basic, and Windows XP Home. Windows Live primarily generates revenue from online advertising. Windows Division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that pre install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Windows Division revenue. The remaining approximately 20% of Windows Division revenue (other revenue) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and online advertising from Windows Live. Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Windows Division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 16% to 18%. OEM revenue increased $2.6 billion or 22%, while OEM license units increased 21%. The OEM revenue increase was driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, and the mix of versions of Windows licensed, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer PCs versus business PCs. Fiscal year 2009 OEM revenue reflects a $273 million Windows 7 Deferral, as discussed under Overview and Outlook above. This amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010. Other revenue increased $912 million or 29% driven primarily by Windows 7 retail sales. Windows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $296 million or 22%, primarily driven by royalties and other product costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $256 million or 11% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Windows Division revenue decreased primarily as a result of PC market weakness, especially PCs sold to businesses. OEM revenue decreased $2.3 billion or 16% while OEM license units declined 2%. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources experienced a decline of approximately 1% to growth of approximately 2%, driven by changes in demand in emerging and developed markets. Windows Division operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $100 million or 5%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing. Server and Tools (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Revenue $ 14,866 $ 14,191 $ 13,195 5% 8% Operating income $ 5,491 $ 4,803 $ 4,149 14% 16% Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and delivers Enterprise Services, all of which are designed to make information technology professionals, developers and their systems more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings consist of Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure 25 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 and other cloud and server offerings. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server product offerings can be run on site, in a partner hosted environment, or in a Microsoft hosted environment. We use multiple sales channels, including pre installed OEM versions, sales through partners and sales directly to end customers. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes from annuity volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services. Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Server and Tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. Product revenue increased $652 million or 6%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server and Enterprise CAL Suites revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. Enterprise Services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in Premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services. Server and Tools operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth and reduced research and development expenses, offset in part by increased cost of revenue. Research and development expenses decreased $38 million or 2%, primarily driven by reduced third party development and programming costs and headcount related expenses, offset in part by increased hosting, localization and lab costs. Cost of revenue increased $25 million. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. Product revenue increased $741 million or 7%, primarily driven by growth in SQL Server, Enterprise CAL Suites, and System Center revenue. This growth reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the Windows Server Platform and applications. Enterprise Services revenue increased $255 million or 10%, primarily due to revenue from annuity support agreements. Server and Tools revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $140 million. Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in product revenue, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and cost of revenue. Research and development expenses increased $242 million or 12%, primarily driven by increased headcount related expenses. Cost of revenue increased $82 million or 3%, reflecting the growth in support, online, and consulting services. Online Services Division (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Revenue $ 2,199 $ 2,121 $ 2,198 4% (4)% Operating loss $ (2,355 ) $ (1,652 ) $ (578 ) (43)% (186)% Online Services Division (OSD) offerings include Bing, MSN, and advertiser and publisher tools. Yahoo! Commercial Agreement On December 4, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! Web sites. We believe this agreement will allow us over time to improve the effectiveness and increase the value of our search offering through greater scale in search 26 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 queries and an expanded and more competitive search and advertising marketplace. See Note 16 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K) for additional information about the agreement. Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 OSD revenue increased reflecting increased online advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased Access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $146 million or 8% to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased advertiser and publisher tools revenue. Access revenue decreased $57 million or 31%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced service providers. OSD operating loss increased due to increased operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $565 million, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs and Yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs. General and administrative expenses increased $136 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased $56 million or 5% due mainly to increased marketing of Bing, offset in part by decreased headcount related expenses. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 OSD revenue decreased primarily as a result of decreased Access revenue, partially offset by increased online advertising revenue. Access revenue decreased $72 million or 28%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced service providers. Online advertising revenue increased $6 million to $1.8 billion, reflecting an increase in search revenue, partially offset by a decrease in display advertising revenue. OSD revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of $28 million. OSD operating loss increased due to increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses, and decreased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $700 million or 82%, primarily driven by increased online traffic acquisition, data center and equipment, and headcount related costs. Research and development expenses increased $153 million or 17%, primarily due to increased headcount related expenses. Microsoft Business Division (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Revenue $ 18,642 $ 18,910 $ 18,899 (1)% 0% Operating income $ 11,776 $ 11,664 $ 11,859 1% (2)% Microsoft Business Division (MBD) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue. 27 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 MBD revenue decreased primarily as a result of the net deferral of $254 million of revenue related to eligible sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the 2010 Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the Office 2010 Deferral). Consumer revenue decreased $166 million or 5%, primarily due to the Office 2010 Deferral, offset in part by growth in the PC market and sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Business revenue decreased $102 million or 1%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by growth in multi year volume licensing agreement revenue and licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers. Microsoft Dynamics revenue was flat. MBD operating income increased due mainly to decreased operating expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $266 million or 6%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses decreased $187 million or 11%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs and lower headcount related expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $53 million or 18% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer ASA (FAST) and lower headcount related expenses. These decreases were offset in part by a $126 million or 11% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 MBD revenue was flat reflecting increased business revenue offset by decreased consumer revenue. Business revenue increased $458 million or 3%, primarily reflecting growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and included a 7% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. The growth in volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements. Consumer revenue decreased $447 million or 12%, primarily as a result of PC market weakness, a shift to lower priced products, and pricing promotions on the 2007 Microsoft Office system. MBD revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $378 million. MBD operating income decreased reflecting increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $134 million or 14% primarily driven by expenses associated with FAST, which we acquired in April 2008, as well as online services infrastructure costs. Research and development expenses increased $118 million or 8%, primarily driven by an increase in headcount related expenses associated with FAST. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $79 million or 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount related costs associated with our corporate sales force. Entertainment and Devices Division (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Revenue $ 8,058 $ 8,035 $ 8,495 0% (5)% Operating income $ 679 $ 108 $ 445 529% (76)% Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD) offerings include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), the Zune digital music and entertainment platform (Zune), PC software games, online games and services, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), Windows Phone and Windows Embedded device platforms, application software for Apples Macintosh computers, Microsoft PC hardware products, and other devices. EDD is also responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and Windows operating systems. 28 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 EDD revenue was nearly flat reflecting increased revenue from the non gaming portion of the business, partially offset by decreased revenue from Xbox 360 platform and PC games. Non gaming revenue increased $35 million or 1% primarily reflecting increased sales of Windows Embedded device platforms, offset in part by decreased Zune and Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $12 million, primarily reflecting a reduction in Xbox 360 consoles sold and revenue per console, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 10.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fiscal year 2010, compared with 11.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2009. EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $528 million or 11%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalty costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third party content sales and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone. Research and development expenses decreased $34 million or 2%, primarily reflecting decreased third party development and programming costs. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 EDD revenue decreased across most lines of business. Revenue from our non gaming business decreased $300 million or 11%, primarily reflecting decreased Zune and PC hardware product revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $160 million or 3%, primarily as a result of decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console due to price reductions during the past 12 months, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 console sales and increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 11.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2009, compared with 8.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2008. EDD revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of $74 million. EDD operating income decreased primarily due to decreased revenue and increased research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased cost of revenue. Research and development expenses increased $275 million or 17%, primarily reflecting increased headcount related expenses associated with the Windows Phone device platform, driven by recent acquisitions. Cost of revenue decreased $344 million or 7%, primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 platform costs. Corporate Level Activity (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Corporate level activity $ (4,470 ) $ (4,542 ) $ (6,026 ) 2% 25% Certain corporate level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance. Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Corporate level expenses decreased due mainly to employee severance charges of $330 million incurred in the prior year, decreased partner payments, and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts. These decreases in expenses were offset in part by an increase in legal charges and costs associated with broad based sales and marketing activities. Legal charges were approximately $533 million compared to $283 million in the prior year. 29 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Corporate level expenses decreased during fiscal year 2009, primarily reflecting decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by employee severance charges of $330 million. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.4 billion or 36%, primarily due to decreased costs for legal settlements and contingencies. We incurred $283 million of legal charges during fiscal year 2009 as compared to $1.8 billion during fiscal year 2008. The prior year costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million). Sales and marketing expenses decreased $513 million or 82%, reflecting the resource management program implemented in January 2009.

Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 General and administrative expenses increased due to increased legal charges, as discussed above within Corporate Level Activity, and transition expenses associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. These increases were offset in part by a 6% reduction in headcount related expenses. 31 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 General and administrative expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. We incurred legal charges of $283 million in fiscal year 2009, as compared with $1.8 billion during fiscal year 2008. The fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million). Employee Severance In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce employee headcount. We completed this program in fiscal year 2010, reducing our overall headcount by approximately 5,300 in various functions, including research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we recorded employee severance expense of $59 million and $330 million, respectively. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND INCOME TAXES Other Income (Expense) The components of other income (expense) were as follows: (In millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 PercentageChange 2010Versus 2009 PercentageChange 2009Versus 2008 Dividends and interest income $ 843 $ 744 $ 994 13% (25)% Interest expense (151 ) (38 ) (106 ) (297)% 64% Net recognized gains (losses) on investments 348 (125 ) 346 * * Net gains (losses) on derivatives (140 ) (558 ) 226 75% * Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements 1 (509 ) 226 * * Other 14 (56 ) (143 ) * 61% Total $ 915 $ (542 ) $ 1,543 * * * Not meaningful We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed income investments. Interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in May 2009. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other than temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period. Other than temporary impairments were $69 million during fiscal year 2010, as compared with $862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period. Net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of $509 million in the prior year, which had resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the prior year. For fiscal year 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish. 32 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed income investments. Interest expense decreased due to lower average collateral balances on loaned securities and related rates. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher other than temporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. Other than temporary impairments were $862 million during fiscal year 2009, as compared with $312 million during fiscal year 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in fiscal year 2009 as compared with gains in the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 2009. Income Taxes Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 25% and 27%, respectively. The fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 27% and 26%, respectively. While the fiscal year 2009 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year 2008 rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settling the 2000 2003 examination, partially offset by the European Commission fine which was not tax deductible. As a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years, we paid the IRS approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $36.8 billion as of June 30, 2010, compared with $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2009. Equity and other investments were $7.8 billion as of June 30, 2010, compared with $4.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. Our short term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of investment grade fixed income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also include foreign currency denominated securities in order to diversify risk. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all 33 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 of our broker priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period over period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. While we own certain mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities, our portfolio as of June 30, 2010 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association. We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Debt In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. As of June 30, 2010, we had $6.0 billion of issued and outstanding debt comprised of $1.0 billion of commercial paper and $5.0 billion of long term debt including $1.25 billion of convertible debt. Short term Debt As of June 30, 2010, our $1.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 216 days. In November 2009, we replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a $2.25 billion 364 day credit facility, which expires on November 5, 2010. This facility serves as a back up for our commercial paper program. In June 2010, we reduced the size of our credit facility from $2.25 billion to $1.0 billion due to the reduction in commercial paper outstanding. As of June 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility agreement, which requires a coverage ratio be maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented. Long term Debt Notes As of June 30, 2010, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively the Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. Convertible Debt In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses which were capitalized. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper, leaving $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of June 30, 2010. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. 34 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsofts common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million, with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price initially equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and were charged to stockholders equity. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue at June 30, 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2010 also included payments for: post delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, Xbox LIVE subscriptions; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis for Windows XP; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; technology guarantee programs, including the 2010 Microsoft Office technology guarantee program; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2010: (In millions) Three Months Ending, September 30, 2010 $ 5,150 December 31, 2010 4,239 March 31, 2011 2,815 June 30, 2011 1,448 Thereafter 1,178 Total $ 14,830 Cash Flows Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Cash flow from operations increased $5.0 billion, primarily due to payment of $4.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000 2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year. Cash used for financing increased $5.8 billion, primarily due to a $5.6 billion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of short term and long term debt. Financing activities also included a $1.9 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, which was offset in part 35 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 by a $1.7 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued. Cash used for investing decreased $4.5 billion due to a $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities along with a $1.1 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Cash flow from operations decreased $2.6 billion due to payment of approximately $4.1 billion to the IRS in connection with our settlement of the 2000 2003 audit examination. This impact was partially offset by the fiscal year 2008 payment of the $1.4 billion (899 million) European Commission fine. Cash used for financing decreased $5.5 billion primarily due to $5.7 billion of net cash proceeds from issuance of short term and long term debt in fiscal year 2009. Financing activities also included a $3.2 billion decrease in common stock repurchased, which was offset by a $2.9 billion decline in common stock issued. Cash used for investing increased $11.2 billion due to a $15.9 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a $1.7 billion decrease in cash from investment sales and maturities. These impacts were partially offset by a $7.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies, including the purchase of aQuantive in fiscal year 2008. Share Repurchases On September 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 (the 2007 Programs) to buy back up to $40.0 billion of Microsoft common stock. On September 22, 2008, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of September 30, 2013 (the 2008 Program). As of June 30, 2010, approximately $23.7 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. During the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 380 million shares for $10.8 billion during fiscal year 2010; 318 million shares for $8.2 billion during fiscal year 2009; and 402 million shares for $12.4 billion during fiscal year 2008. All shares repurchased in fiscal year 2010 were repurchased under the 2008 Program, while all shares repurchased in fiscal year 2008 were repurchased under the 2007 Programs. Of the shares repurchased in fiscal year 2009, 101 million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the 2007 Programs, while the remainder were repurchased under the 2008 Program. Dividends During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends: Declaration Date Dividend Per Share Record Date Total Amount Payment Date (In millions) Fiscal Year 2010 September 18, 2009 $ 0.13 November 19, 2009 $ 1,152 December 10, 2009 December 9, 2009 $ 0.13 February 18, 2010 $ 1,139 March 11, 2010 March 8, 2010 $ 0.13 May 20, 2010 $ 1,130 June 10, 2010 June 16, 2010 $ 0.13 August 19, 2010 $ 1,127 September 9, 2010 Fiscal Year 2009 September 19, 2008 $ 0.13 November 20, 2008 $ 1,157 December 11, 2008 December 10, 2008 $ 0.13 February 19, 2009 $ 1,155 March 12, 2009 March 9, 2009 $ 0.13 May 21, 2009 $ 1,158 June 18, 2009 June 10, 2009 $ 0.13 August 20, 2009 $ 1,157 September 10, 2009 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating 36 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2010. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and cash flows from operations. (In millions) 2011 2012 2014 2015 2017 2018 andThereafter Total Long term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 0 $ 3,250 $ 0 $ 1,750 $ 5,000 Interest payments 140 420 243 942 1,745 Construction commitments (b) 347 0 0 0 347 Operating leases (c) 437 784 407 270 1,898 Purchase commitments (d) 3,994 184 0 0 4,178 Other long term liabilities (e) 0 72 9 1 82 Total contractual obligations $ 4,918 $ 4,710 $ 659 $ 2,963 $ 13,250 (a) See Note 12 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K) (b) These amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements. (c) These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. (d) These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take or pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (e) We have excluded long term tax contingencies and other tax liabilities of $7.1 billion and other long term contingent liabilities of $236 million (related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits) from the amounts presented, as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue of $1.2 billion and non cash items of $240 million. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. 37 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $16.7 billion at June 30, 2010. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position. RECENT LEGISLATION In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the United States. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this legislation will largely be funded through tax increases to both insurers and the insured. We do not expect any near term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation. One provision that will impact certain companies significantly is the elimination of the tax deductibility of the Medicare Part D subsidy. This provision does not affect us because we do not provide retiree health benefits. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB on business combinations. The guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred. We have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since July 1, 2009. On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB that changes the accounting and reporting for non controlling interests. Non controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parents equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to a non controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope 38 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, stock based compensation, and product warranties. Revenue Recognition Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method, and the deferred revenue is recognized as the elements are delivered. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. A portion of the revenue related to Windows XP is recorded as unearned due to the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when and if available basis. Revenue related to Windows Vista and Windows 7 is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. 2007 Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the 2010 Microsoft Office system technology guarantee program, which started March 5, 2010. This program allows customers who purchased certain versions of the 2007 Microsoft Office system to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of the 2010 Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost when the product becomes generally available. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2010 Microsoft Office system is deferred until the product is delivered. Impairment of Investment Securities Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. 39 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In addition to the impairment test performed on May 1, 2010, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our Online Services Division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 in connection with the disposal of Razorfish. No impairment of goodwill was identified. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax 40 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted. Product Warranties We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. 41 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Steven A. Ballmer Chief Executive Officer Peter S. Klein Chief Financial Officer Frank H.

QUANTATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements. Foreign Currency. Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate. Our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage backed securities. Equity. Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity. We use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. VALUE AT RISK We use a value at risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. The following table sets forth the one day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2010 and 2009 and for the year ended June 30, 2010: (In millions) June 30,2010 June 30,2009 Year Ended June 30, 2010 Risk Categories Average High Low Foreign currency $ 57 $ 68 $ 53 $ 86 $ 20 Interest rate $ 58 $ 42 $ 54 $ 69 $ 43 Equity $ 183 $ 157 $ 184 $ 206 $ 142 Commodity $ 19 $ 16 $ 17 $ 20 $ 14 Total one day VaR for the combined risk categories was $235 million at June 30, 2010 and $211 million at June 30, 2009. The total VaR is 26% less at June 30, 2010, and 25% less at June 30, 2009, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. 43 Table of Contents PART II Item 8
