Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments MT Bank Corporation (MT) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $31.5 billion at December 31, 2001. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects MT and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. MTs wholly owned bank subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (MT Bank) and MT Bank, National Association (MT Bank, N.A.). MT Bank, with total assets of $30.8 billion at December 31, 2001, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 469 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. MT Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. MT Banks subsidiaries include: MT Credit Corporation, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; MT Financial Corporation, a commercial leasing company; MT Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; MT Real Estate, Inc., a commercial mortgage lender; MT Securities, Inc., a broker/dealer; Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company; and Matthews, Bartlett Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency. MT Bank, N.A., with total assets of $810 million at December 31, 2001, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. MT Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products are offered by MT Bank, N.A. through banking offices of MT Bank. On February 9, 2001, MT acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (Premier), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York. Premier National Bank, Premiers bank subsidiary, was merged into MT Bank on that date. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in the mid Hudson Valley region of New York State. As of the merger date, assets acquired totaled approximately $1.8 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion of loans and leases, and liabilities assumed were approximately $1.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion of deposits. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, 24 Table of Contents accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier have been included in MTs financial results subsequent to the acquisition date. Premiers stockholders received $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of MT common stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178 million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit intangible. On October 6, 2000, MT completed the acquisition of Keystone Financial, Inc. (Keystone), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A., Keystones bank subsidiary, was merged into MT Bank on that date. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A. operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Keystone have been included in MTs financial results since the acquisition date. Keystones stockholders received $375 million in cash and 15,900,292 shares of MT common stock in exchange for the Keystone shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. The Company recorded approximately $475 million of goodwill and $121 million of core deposit intangible as a result of the Keystone acquisition. Following the completion of an actuarial review and merger of the pension and other post retirement benefits plans of MT and Keystone, in 2001 the Company adjusted the net prepaid benefit cost obtained in the acquisition of Keystone. The effect of such adjustment was to increase net prepaid benefit costs by approximately $28 million and, after applicable tax effect, to decrease goodwill by approximately $18 million. Reflecting such adjustments, the accompanying table provides a summary of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company on October 6, 2000 in the Keystone transaction. (in thousands) Assets Investment securities $ 1,167,646 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 4,847,013 Allowance for possible credit losses (49,518 ) Loans and leases, net 4,797,495 Goodwill and core deposit intangible 596,157 Other assets 858,602 Total assets $ 7,419,900 Liabilities Deposits $ 5,182,893 Short term borrowings 348,842 Long term borrowings 670,924 Other liabilities 178,699 Total liabilities $ 6,381,358 In connection with the acquisitions described above, the Company incurred nonrecurring expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming the acquired operations with and into the operations of MT Bank. Nonrecurring expenses associated with the Premier and Keystone acquisitions totaled approximately $8 million ($5 million after tax) and $26 million ($16 million after tax) during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Such expenses consisted largely of expenses for professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and or integration of operations; recruiting and other incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce MT Bank to customers; travel; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Premier merger were charges totaling $4 million, net of applicable income taxes, for severance of former Premier 25 Table of Contents employees; legal and other professional fees; and termination of Premier contracts for data processing and other services. As of December 31, 2001, unpaid Premier merger related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill were insignificant. The resolution of any preacquisition contingencies is not expected to have a material impact on the allocation of the purchase price or the amount of goodwill recorded as part of the Premier acquisition. Included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Keystone merger were charges totaling $30 million, net of applicable income taxes, for severance of former Keystone employees; investment banking, legal and other professional fees; and termination of Keystone contracts for data processing and other services. As of December 31, 2001, unpaid Keystone merger related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill were insignificant. Unpaid Keystone merger related expenses and goodwill charges were $2 million and $7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000. In anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions, MT Bank issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000. The subordinated notes are included in total regulatory capital of MT and MT Bank. The notes pay interest semi annually on April 1 and October 1, and will mature on October 1, 2010. In addition to providing regulatory capital, the proceeds were used to fund the cash portions of the Keystone and Premier merger consideration. In 1999, the Company completed acquisitions of FNB Rochester Corp. (FNB), which through a subsidiary operated 17 banking offices in western and central New York State, and 29 upstate New York banking offices from The Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase). Loans and leases acquired in the merger with FNB totaled $393 million on the June 1, 1999 acquisition date and deposit liabilities assumed were $511 million. At the time of the September 1999 acquisition of the 29 banking offices from Chase, such offices had $634 million of deposits and $44 million of loans. Chase also transferred trust accounts associated with customers of the acquired offices to the Company. Such accounts had transfer date balances of approximately $433 million. Such balances represent customer assets in investment management and custody accounts and, accordingly, are not recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the acquisitions described in the preceding paragraph, the Company recorded $116 million of goodwill and $36 million of core deposit intangible and incurred $5 million ($3 million after tax) of nonrecurring expenses similar in nature to those previously described as having been incurred in connection with the Keystone and Premier mergers. Overview MT reported net income in 2001 of $378 million or $3.82 of diluted earnings per common share, increases of 32% and 11%, respectively, from $286 million or $3.44 per diluted share in 2000. Basic earnings per common share rose 11% to $3.95 in 2001 from $3.55 in 2000. Net income in 1999 totaled $266 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $3.28 and $3.41, respectively. The after tax impact of nonrecurring expenses associated with the previously described acquisitions was $5 million ($8 million pre tax) or $.05 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2001, $16 million ($26 million pre tax) or $.20 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2000, and $3 million ($5 million pre tax) or $.03 of diluted earnings per share and $.04 of basic earnings per share in 1999. Net income represented a return on average assets in 2001 of 1.23%, compared with 1.21% in 2000 and 1.26% in 1999. The return on average common stockholders equity was 12.78% in 2001, 14.07% in 2000 and 15.30% in 1999. 26 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of merger related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity in 2001 were 1.24% and 12.94%, respectively, compared with 1.28% and 14.88%, respectively, in 2000 and 1.28% and 15.47%, respectively, in 1999. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 36% to $1.176 billion in 2001 from $865 million in 2000, largely due to a $6.3 billion or 29% increase in average earning assets to $27.8 billion in 2001 from $21.5 billion in 2000 and a widening of the Companys net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Including the impact of the loans obtained at the time of the acquisitions of Keystone and Premier, average loans and leases increased $5.9 billion or 32%, to $24.4 billion in 2001 from $18.5 billion in 2000. Net interest margin improved by 21 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.23% in 2001 from 4.02% a year earlier, due largely to the declining interest rate environment throughout 2001. A 13% increase in average earning assets in 2000 was the most significant factor contributing to the rise in that years net interest income from $767 million in 1999. The increase in average earning assets resulted primarily from growth in average loans and leases. Despite the impact of the securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2000, average loans and leases during 2000 rose $2.1 billion or 13% from $16.4 billion in 1999. Excluding the impact of the securitization, average loans and leases grew approximately $2.7 billion in 2000, approximately half of which was due to new originations, net of repayments. The remaining increase was largely the result of the $4.8 billion of loans and leases obtained in the October 2000 acquisition of Keystone. Reflecting the weakened economy, nationally and in the markets directly served by the Company, the provision for credit losses increased to $104 million in 2001 from $38 million in 2000 and $45 million in 1999. Net charge offs totaled $75 million in 2001, up significantly from $29 million in 2000 and $40 million in 1999. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding rose to .31% in 2001 from .16% and .25% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the entitys approach to managing risk. The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS No. 133 was not material to the Companys consolidated financial position or its results of operations. As a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 133, hedged residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to 27 Table of Contents originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans are now generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value, rather than at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value, which was the Companys policy prior to January 1, 2001. As a result of recording such items at estimated fair market value, the Company recognized approximately $8 million of additional mortgage banking revenues in 2001. If not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 133, such revenues would have generally been recognized in 2002 as the residential mortgage loans to which they related were sold. The impact on the Companys results of operations resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as related to the Companys use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was not significant. Noninterest income totaled $477 million in 2001, 47% above the $325 million in 2000. Noninterest income was $282 million in 1999. Approximately 55% of the increase from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to revenues related to operations in market areas associated with the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Growth in mortgage banking revenues, including the impact of adopting SFAS No. 133 described in the preceding paragraph, and higher service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the increase in noninterest income. Contributing to the higher noninterest income in 2000 as compared with 1999 were increases in service charges on deposit accounts, income from leasing activities and brokerage services income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities. Approximately 40% of the increase in 2000s noninterest income from 1999 was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the Keystone acquisition. Noninterest operating expenses, which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and nonrecurring merger related expenses, were $819 million in 2001, 37% higher than $599 million in 2000. Nonrecurring merger related expenses excluded from noninterest operating expenses were $8 million and $26 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Charges for goodwill and core deposit intangible amortization excluded from noninterest operating expenses were $69 million and $53 million, respectively, in 2001 and $44 million and $26 million, respectively, in 2000. Expenses related to the acquired operations of Keystone and Premier significantly contributed to the higher operating expense levels in 2001 compared with 2000. Also contributing to such higher expense levels were increased expenses for salaries and employee benefits, including incentive based compensation arrangements, advertising, professional and other services, and amortization of capitalized servicing rights. Noninterest operating expenses were 14% higher in 2000 than 1999s total of $525 million. Excluded from MTs operating expenses in 1999 were $5 million of nonrecurring merger related expenses, $36 million of amortization of goodwill and $14 million of amortization of core deposit intangible. Higher salaries and employee benefits expenses, including merit salary increases, incentive based compensation arrangements, and increased staffing levels as a result of acquisitions in 2000 and 1999, contributed to 2000s increase in noninterest operating expenses. The efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income measures how much of a companys revenue is consumed by operating expenses. The Companys efficiency ratio, calculated using the operating expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income, was 49.6% in 2001, improved from 50.2% in 2000 and 50.1% in 1999. 28 Table of Contents Cash Operating Results MT has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting, unlike many other banking companies. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting predominately of goodwill and core deposit intangible totaling $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $648 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Included in such intangible assets at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was goodwill of $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $572 million, respectively. Charges for amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible, after tax effect, were $66 million ($.67 per diluted share) and $33 million ($.33 per diluted share), respectively, during 2001. Comparable after tax amortization charges in 2000 were $40 million ($.48 per diluted share) for goodwill and $16 million ($.19 per diluted share) for core deposit intangible, and in 1999 were $34 million ($.43 per diluted share) for goodwill and $8 million ($.10 per diluted share) for core deposit intangible. Since the amortization of these acquired intangible assets does not result in a cash expense, MT believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on a cash, or tangible, basis (which excludes the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the related asset balances) represents a relevant measure of financial performance. The supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of other non cash operating expenses such as depreciation, provision for credit losses, or deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations. Unless noted otherwise, cash basis data do, however, exclude the after tax impact of nonrecurring merger related expenses associated with acquisitions. Cash net income increased 34% to $482 million in 2001 from $359 million in 2000. Diluted and basic cash earnings per share in 2001 both increased by 13% to $4.87 and $5.04, respectively, from $4.31 and $4.45, respectively, in 2000. In 1999, cash net income totaled $311 million, while diluted and basic cash earnings per share were $3.84 and $3.99, respectively. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, cash net income was 1.63% in 2001, compared with 1.56% in 2000 and 1.52% in 1999. Cash return on average tangible common equity was 28.50% in 2001, compared with 27.65% and 26.71% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Including the effect of merger related expenses, the cash return on average tangible assets for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 1.62%, 1.49% and 1.50%, respectively, and the cash return on average tangible common equity was 28.22%, 26.38% and 26.45%, respectively. As further discussed under the heading Recently Issued Accounting Standards, effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions will no longer be amortized, but rather it will be tested for impairment no less frequently than annually. However, goodwill associated with most branch acquisitions, core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets will continue to be amortized subsequent to January 1, 2002. Amortization expense relating to such assets is expected to approximate $51 million ($33 million after tax) in 2002. Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 36% to $1.176 billion in 2001 from $865 million in 2000, largely the result of growth in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin. 2000s taxable equivalent net interest income represented a 13% increase from $767 million in 1999. That increase was also largely due to higher balances of average earning assets. The Companys average earning assets were $27.8 billion, $21.5 billion and $19.1 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 29 Table of Contents growth in such assets in 2001 and 2000 was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $24.4 billion in 2001, up 32% from $18.5 billion in 2000 and 49% higher than $16.4 billion in 1999. The higher levels of loans and leases in 2001 reflect the impact of loans obtained in the Keystone and Premier mergers as well as growth from new loan originations, net of customer repayments. On the October 6, 2000 acquisition date, Keystones loans totaled $4.8 billion and included approximately $1.2 billion of commercial loans, $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans and $1.2 billion of consumer loans and leases. Loans obtained in the Premier acquisition on February 9, 2001 totaled $994 million and included $127 million of commercial loans, $317 million of commercial real estate loans, $356 million of residential real estate loans, and $194 million of consumer loans. Approximately one fourth of the increase in average loans and leases during 2001 was attributable to net loan origination activities. Of such increase, approximately $450 million was attributable to higher average balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale. Growth in average loans and leases in 2000 resulting from origination and acquisition activities was partially offset by the impact of the securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans during 2000s second quarter. The resulting mortgage backed securities, which are fully guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, are included in the Companys portfolio of available for sale investment securities. Excluding the impact of the securitization, average loans and leases grew by approximately $2.7 billion, or 17%, from 1999 to 2000. Approximately half of such growth was attributable to new originations, net of the impact of repayments. The remaining increase was largely the result of the $4.8 billion of loans obtained in the October 2000 acquisition of Keystone. The accompanying table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2001 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years. Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 64% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2001, compared with 65% in 2000 and 66% in 1999. At December 31, 2001, the Company held approximately $9.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $5.4 billion of consumer real estate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $1.5 billion of outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit, compared with $8.7 billion, $4.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2000. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are largely secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates, including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Hudson Valley and Southern Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in central Pennsylvania, Maryland, Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. In response to customer needs, in recent years the Company has also originated fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years. The Company also originates adjustable rate commercial real estate loans, which represented approximately 38% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2001. The accompanying table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2001. Of the $3.9 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York 30 Table of Contents City metropolitan area, approximately 41% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 23% by retail space and 14% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up approximately 34% of the total. Less than 7% of loans secured by commercial real estate properties in the New York City metropolitan area at December 31, 2001 were secured by properties located in lower Manhattan. The Company did not experience any significant losses or delinquencies in its loan portfolios as a direct result of the events of September 11, 2001. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in New York State and in Pennsylvania tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 76% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for $5 million or less, while approximately 83% of the outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania were for $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New York State and Pennsylvania, and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 10% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2001. Of the $539 million of commercial construction loans presented in the accompanying table, $289 million represent loans for which the Company has also committed to provide permanent financing. Commercial construction loans represented 2% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2001. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2001, including approximately 48% secured by properties located in New York State and 24% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2001, $1.0 billion of residential real estate loans were held for sale by MT Mortgage Corporation, the Companys residential mortgage banking subsidiary, compared with $525 million at December 31, 2000. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $491 million at December 31, 2001, or approximately 2% of total loans and leases. Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 19% of the average loan portfolio during 2001, up from 18% during 2000 and 1999. Automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 83% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2001 were secured by properties in New York State and 14% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2001, 33% and 43% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers, however, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 9% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2001, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 6%. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $587 million in 2001, and $375 million in both 2000 and 1999. Automobile leases acquired in the Keystone transaction totaled $231 million on October 6, 2000. The investment securities portfolio averaged $3.3 billion in 2001, up from $2.8 billion in 2000 and $2.1 billion in 1999. Investment securities obtained in the acquisition of Keystone added approximately $359 and $185 31 Table of Contents million to the average balances in 2001 and 2000, respectively, while investment securities obtained in the Premier acquisition added approximately $300 million to the average balance in 2001. The remaining increase in 2000 from 1999 was generally the result of the previously described securitization of approximately $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2000. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial real estate mortgage backed securities, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. The Company has also invested in debt securities issued by municipalities and debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or following completion of a business combination. Investment securities obtained in the Keystone transaction totaled approximately $1.2 billion on October 6, 2000 and in the Premier transaction totaled $453 million on February 9, 2001. Money market assets, which are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks, interest earning trading account assets, Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities, averaged $80 million in 2001, compared with $239 million in 2000 and $517 million in 1999. The size of the investment securities and money market assets portfolios are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which consist of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by MT Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Average core deposits were $17.6 billion in 2001, up from $13.6 billion in 2000 and $11.9 billion in 1999. The increase in average core deposits in 2001 was largely due to the full year impact of the $4.7 billion of core deposits obtained on October 6, 2000 in connection with the Keystone transaction, as well as the $1.2 billion of core deposits obtained on February 9, 2001 in connection with the Premier acquisition. The Company experienced a shift in the composition of core deposits throughout 2001, largely as a result of the lower interest rate environment. Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average savings deposits rose to $8.0 billion during the fourth quarter of 2001 from $6.8 billion in the years first quarter. In contrast, average time deposits under $100,000 decreased to $5.3 billion in the final 2001 quarter from $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2001. Average core deposits of MT Bank, N.A. were $521 million in 2001, $643 million in 2000 and $429 million in 1999. Funding provided by core deposits totaled 63% of average earning assets in 2001 and 2000, compared with 62% in 1999. The accompanying 7 table summarizes average core deposits in 2001 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered certificates of deposit. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.0 billion in 2001, compared with $1.8 billion in 2000 and $1.6 billion in 1999. Offshore branch deposits, comprised primarily of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $327 million in 2001, compared with $250 million 32 Table of Contents and $254 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Brokered deposits, which have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings, averaged $794 million in 2001, $696 million in 2000 and $1.1 billion in 1999, and totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2001. The weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at December 31, 2001 was .5 years. Certain of the brokered deposits have provisions that allow early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms similar to the amounts and terms of $334 million of brokered deposits. Additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (together, the FHLB), and others as sources of funding. Short term borrowings averaged $3.3 billion in 2001, $2.7 billion in 2000 and $2.1 billion in 1999. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short term borrowings averaged $814 million in 2001, $574 million in 2000 and $356 million in 1999. The average balance of long term borrowings was $3.5 billion in 2001, $2.1 billion in 2000 and $1.7 billion in 1999. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $2.4 billion in 2001, $1.4 billion in 2000 and $1.2 billion in 1999 and subordinated capital notes issued by MT Bank of $674 million in 2001, $295 million in 2000 and $175 million in 1999. As previously noted, MT Bank issued $500 million of 8% subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000 in anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Trust preferred securities with a carrying value of $318 million that were issued in 1997 are also included in average long term borrowings. Information regarding trust preferred securities, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain interest rate swap agreements have been entered into by the Company as part of its management of interest rate risk relating to long term FHLB borrowings. Further information on such interest rate swaps is provided in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements. Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Throughout 2001, the Federal Reserve took numerous actions to lower the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by 475 basis points. In general, such actions resulted in a greater and more rapid decline in short term rates as compared with the decline in longer term rates. The decline in short term interest rates and the general steepening of the yield curve had a positive effect on the Companys net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, in 2001. The yield on the Companys earning assets decreased 68 basis points to 7.62% in 2001 from 8.30% in 2000, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2001 was 3.91%, down 100 basis points from 4.91% in 2000. The impact of the more rapid repricing of interest bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the magnitude of the interest rate reductions led to a 32 basis point increase in the Companys net interest spread, from 3.39% in 2000 to 3.71% in 2001. In 1999, the net interest spread was 3.48%, the yield on earning assets was 7.79% and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 4.31%. The yield on earning assets increased 51 basis points in 2000 from 7.79% in 1999 and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased even further, rising 60 basis points from 4.31% in 1999. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 1999 and the first five months of 2000 contributed to the rising level of interest rates in 2000. 33 Table of Contents Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets that include goodwill and core deposit intangible. Average net interest free funds totaled $3.7 billion in 2001, $2.8 billion in 2000 and $2.4 billion in 1999. The rise in average net interest free funds in 2001 as compared with 2000 was due largely to increases in noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity. Net interest free funds contributed .52% to net interest margin in 2001, compared with .63% in 2000 and .54% in 1999. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2001 from 2000 resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. The increase in the contribution in 2000 (as compared with 1999) resulted from the impact of that years higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities and a $390 million increase in the average balance of net interest free funds, largely comprised of higher average balances in noninterest bearing deposits and retained earnings. Goodwill and core deposit intangible assets averaged $1.3 billion in 2001, $766 million in 2000 and $594 million in 1999, while the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $573 million in 2001, $458 million in 2000 and $379 million in 1999. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest margin and net interest income. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or, as appropriate, the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 2001 was approximately $576 million. In general, under the terms of these swaps, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates. However, under the terms of $117 million of swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate. In anticipation of the previously noted issuance of $500 million of fixed rate subordinated notes in October 2000, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements during September 2000, including forward starting swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $421 million. Under the terms of the terminated swaps, the Company would have made fixed rate payments and received variable rate payments. The termination of these swaps, which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed rate commercial real estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately $15.5 million which is being recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the swaps. The impact on the Companys results of operations in 2001 and 2000 from amortizing the net deferred gain was not significant. The amounts of net deferred gain to be recognized in future years is included in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements. As previously discussed, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001. As a result, $476 million of the Companys interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2001 had been designated as fair value hedges and $100 million had been designated as cash flow hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair 34 Table of Contents value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in 2001 was not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was a gain of approximately $5 million at December 31, 2001. The fair value of such swaps was substantially offset by unrealized losses on the fair value of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately $461 thousand at December 31, 2001. Net of applicable income taxes, such loss was approximately $298 thousand and has been included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, the fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was not recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The unrecognized fair value associated with such interest rate swaps at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were pre tax gains of approximately $1 million and $25 million, respectively. The average notional amounts of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in the accompanying table 8. Provision For Credit Losses A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the Companys allowance for credit losses to a level that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $104 million in 2001, up from $38 million in 2000 and $45 million in 1999. Reflecting general weakness in the U.S. economy and in markets directly served by the Company, net loan charge offs in 2001 were $75 million, significantly higher than $29 million in 2000 and $40 million in 1999. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding increased to .31% in 2001 from .16% in 2000 and .25% in 1999. The Company did not experience any significant charge offs or delinquencies in its portfolio of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area that were directly related to the events of September 11, 2001. A summary of loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in the accompanying table 9. Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, totaled $190 million or .76% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2001, compared with $111 million or .49% at December 31, 2000 and $72 million or .41% at December 31, 1999. The higher level of nonperforming loans in 2001 reflects the weakened economy and its impact on the Companys customers. The recent years increase in nonperforming loans also reflects two larger balance commercial loans totaling $40 million at 2001s year end that were classified as non performing during the year. The increase in nonperforming loans at the end of 2000 as compared with a year earlier reflects the impact of loans obtained in the October 6, 2000 acquisition of Keystone. Nonperforming loans obtained in such acquisition were $50 million at December 31, 2001 and $43 million at December 31, 2000. Nonperforming loans obtained in the February 9, 2001 acquisition of Premier were $7 million at December 31, 2001. No loans were reported as nonperforming at December 31, 2001 as a direct result of the events of September 11, 2001. 35 Table of Contents Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $147 million or .58% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2001, compared with $142 million or .62% at December 31, 2000 and $31 million or .18% at December 31, 1999. In general, such loans are either guaranteed by government agencies or well secured by collateral. The increases from 1999 resulted largely from the inclusion of $108 million and $93 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company and repurchased from the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies. The loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with the loans, including a requirement to advance to GNMA principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Several factors influence the Companys credit loss experience, including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Net charge offs of commercial real estate loans in 2001 were $5 million. During 2000 and 1999, the Company realized net recoveries of previously charged off commercial real estate loans of $383 thousand and $2 million, respectively. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled $39 million at December 31, 2001, compared with $37 million and $13 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Commercial real estate loans obtained in the Keystone acquisition that were classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $20 million and $23 million, respectively. Similar loans obtained in the Premier acquisition were $2 million at December 31, 2001. During 2001, net charge offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $32 million, compared with $6 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. The higher level of charge offs in 2001 compared with 2000 was mainly a function of 2001s economic downturn, while the higher level of charge offs in 1999 compared with 2000 was largely the result of two commercial loans with partial charge offs aggregating $15 million. Reflecting the weakened economy and the two previously noted loans totaling $40 million, nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled $85 million at December 31, 2001, up from $26 million and $21 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Commercial loans acquired in the Keystone acquisition that were classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $10 million and $13 million, respectively. Similar loans acquired in the Premier acquisition were $1 million at December 31, 2001. Net charge offs of residential real estate loans were $6 million in 2001, compared with $5 million and $4 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Residential real estate loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2001 totaled $40 million, compared with $36 million and $26 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due ninety days or more and accruing interest totaled $135 million, $115 million and $14 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As noted earlier, the higher level of such loans in 2001 and 2000 as compared with 1999 resulted largely from the inclusion at December 31, 2001 and 2000 of $108 million and $93 million, respectively, of loans repurchased from GNMA. The repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies. Residential real estate loans obtained in the Keystone acquisition that were classified at December 31, 2001 as nonperforming and accruing loans past due 36 Table of Contents ninety days or more were $14 million and $12 million, respectively. Such loans were $7 million and $8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000. Similar loans obtained in the Premier acquisition were $3 million and $2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Net charge offs of consumer loans and leases were $32 million in 2001, representing .68% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the year, compared with $19 million or .56% in 2000 and $22 million or .72% in 1999. Charge offs of indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant type of consumer loans charged off during the past three years. Net indirect automobile loan and lease charge offs during 2001 were $12 million, compared with $7 million in 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases totaled $26 million or .50% of outstanding consumer loans at December 31, 2001, compared with $12 million or .29% at December 31, 2000 and $12 million or .37% at December 31, 1999. Accruing consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more were $5 million, $21 million and $16 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company began classifying non guaranteed consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more as nonaccrual. Previously, such loans accrued interest until the loan balances were charged off. The change in classification did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial condition. Consumer loans and leases obtained in the Keystone acquisition that were past due ninety days or more and accruing interest were $1 million and $6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Despite the existence of loan collateral in many cases, management conservatively evaluated the collectability of delinquent consumer loans and leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral. Management cautiously evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. In addition to the impact of loans obtained in acquisitions and economic conditions in geographic areas entered through acquisitions, factors considered by management when performing its assessment included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area that have historically experienced significantly less economic growth than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) significant growth in loans to individual consumers. The level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. In ascertaining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components, which are described in the following paragraphs. 37 Table of Contents The amount of specific loss components in the loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans. Specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $100,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the specific loss components are typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive ten point loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Items considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other factors; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national and local economic conditions and trends; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically New York State and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties 38 Table of Contents in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan product types, including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years; and, (v) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 further dampened the economic outlook for the United States, which is now experiencing its first significant downturn in many years. The economies of New York State, and New York City in particular, were specifically damaged by the events of September 11. Economic growth outside of New York City, especially in the industrialized upstate New York markets, continues to lag the rest of the country. Furthermore, consistent with other regions of the country, the unemployment rate in New York State grew significantly in 2001, rising to 5.8% at year end. Slower job growth, coupled with a declining population base, has left the upstate New York region susceptible to credit problems, particularly related to commercial customers. After a brief stabilization in 2000, the central Pennsylvania economy again lagged the rest of the United States in 2001. Employment in central Pennsylvania declined by an average of .2% in 2001, compared with a .3% average increase nationally. The accompanying table 10 presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components. Increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 reflect weakened economic conditions and an increased level of impaired and other classified loans. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 increased to $140 million at December 31, 2001 from $81 million at December 31, 2000. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to such loans was $21 million and $12 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from December 31, 1999 to 2000s year end were largely attributable to the acquired Keystone loans, which were conservatively assigned loan grades based on facts known at the date of acquisition, pending more detailed analyses of such loans by the Companys loan review department. The increase in the allowance allocated to consumer loans as a percentage of such loans at the end of 2000 compared with December 31, 1999 was largely the result of a refinement in loss estimation techniques relating to certain past due consumer loans. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .24% and .22% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Management believes that the aggregate allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2001 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the 39 Table of Contents portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $425 million or 1.69% of total loans at December 31, 2001, compared with $375 million or 1.65% at December 31, 2000 and $316 million or 1.82% at December 31, 1999. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 223%, 339% and 438%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2001 compared with the prior year end also considered the weakened state of the economy in 2001 as well as the other specific factors and conditions described herein. The decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2000 as compared with year end 1999 also reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each date, the relatively favorable and or stable economic environment for many commercial borrowers during much of 2000, and other factors. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 7% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2001. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2001. Furthermore, the Company had no exposure to less developed countries and less than $2 million of outstanding foreign loans at December 31, 2001. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $16 million at December 31, 2001, compared with $14 million a year earlier and $10 million at the end of 1999. Other Income Other income grew 47% to $477 million in 2001 from $325 million in 2000. Approximately 55% of the increase was attributable to the impact of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking revenues also significantly contributed to the increase from 2000. Other income totaled $282 million in 1999. 2000s improvement from 1999 resulted from increases in service charges on deposit accounts, income from leasing activities, and brokerage services income, which were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and losses from sales of bank investment securities. Approximately 40% of 2000s increase was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the Keystone acquisition. Mortgage banking revenues, which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing fees, gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, and other residential mortgage loan related fees, increased 63% to $103 million in 2001 from $63 million in 2000. The higher revenues in 2001 were due largely to the impact of lower interest rates that produced a favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers. Mortgage banking revenues in 2000 were 12% lower than $72 million in 1999, largely the result of higher interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 1999 and first half of 2000 that negatively impacted mortgage loan origination volume in 2000 and tighter pricing margins that resulted from competitive pressures. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $5.0 billion in 2001, compared with $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company maintains residential mortgage loan origination offices in New York State and Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and unrealized gains from recording residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans at fair market value aggregated $50 million in 2001. As noted earlier, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 40 Table of Contents requires that changes in the fair value of hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale be recorded in the Companys results of operations. Such unrealized gains totaled approximately $8 million (pre tax) at December 31, 2001. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, residential mortgage loans originated for sale and related commitments to sell loans and to originate loans for sale were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. The previously noted favorable interest rate environment for loan origination and refinancing activities was the major contributor to the higher realized gains from sales of loans and loan servicing rights in 2001. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights totaled $25 million in 2000 and $40 million in 1999. The tighter pricing margins and a lower volume of originations contributed to the decrease in realized gains from 1999 to 2000. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $44 million in 2001, up from $32 million in 2000 and $27 million in 1999. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $9.6 billion at December 31, 2001, $9.7 billion at December 31, 2000 and $7.2 billion at December 31, 1999. Capitalized servicing assets were $107 million, $101 million and $61 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase from December 31, 1999 to 2000 reflects the Keystone transaction, other purchased servicing rights and the previously noted securitization of $1.0 billion of residential mortgage loans which added approximately $15 million, $21 million and $14 million, respectively, to capitalized servicing assets in 2000. Additional information about the Companys capitalized servicing assets is presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Service charges on deposit accounts rose 56% to $144 million in 2001 from $93 million in 2000, and 96% from $74 million in 1999. Fees for services provided to customers in areas formerly served by Keystone and Premier contributed approximately 60% of the increase from 2000 to 2001. Also contributing to the higher level of service charges in 2001 were higher balances in transactional deposit accounts which generate higher levels of service charges than non transactional accounts. The full year effect in 2000 of a third quarter 1999 increase in fees and the impact of 1999 acquisitions were significant factors contributing to the increase from 1999 to 2000. Additionally, fees for services provided to customers in the areas formerly served by Keystone contributed approximately 30% of the increase from 1999 to 2000. Trust income increased 43% to $64 million in 2001 from $45 million in 2000 and 58% from $41 million in 1999. The increases were largely attributable to the acquisition of Keystone. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $39 million in 2001, up 20% from $33 million in 2000 and 45% higher than $27 million in 1999. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $4 million in 2001, $2 million in 2000 and $315 thousand in 1999. In 1999, a loss of approximately $3 million was incurred as a result of a counterparty defaulting on the settlement of outstanding foreign exchange contracts. During both 2001 and 1999, the Company sold bank investment securities resulting in gains of approximately $2 million. Losses from sales of bank investment securities in 2000 reflect $3 million of net losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 from sales of investment securities following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the investment portfolios of Keystone and the Company. All sold securities had been previously classified as available for sale for financial reporting purposes. Other revenues from operations rose to $120 million in 2001 from $92 million in 2000 and $67 million in 1999. Approximately two thirds of the increase from 2000 to 2001 resulted from activities and or market areas 41 Table of Contents associated with the Keystone and Premier acquisitions, while approximately one sixth of the increase from 1999 to 2000 resulted from operations related to Keystone. Other revenues from operations included $35 million, $26 million and $23 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, of tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Also included were revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees of $13 million, $9 million and $8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Other items that contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations in 2001 from 2000 and 1999 include higher letter of credit and other credit related fees, insurance related revenues, and automated teller machine (ATM) usage fees. Letter of credit and other credit related fees were $24 million, $18 million and $16 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Insurance related revenues totaled $13 million in 2001, compared with $7 million and $1 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The impact of acquisitions was the leading factor contributing to higher insurance related revenues. The increases in ATM usage fees, from $5 million in 1999 to $6 million in 2000 and to $11 million in 2001 were largely the result of the Keystone transaction. Income from leasing activities in 2000 reflected a net gain of $9 million resulting from a nonrecurring $13 million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual of $4 million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles leased to retail customers. Other Expense Operating expenses, which exclude amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible as well as nonrecurring merger related expenses, were $819 million in 2001, 37% higher than $599 million in 2000 and 56% higher than $525 million in 1999. Expenses related to acquired operations significantly contributed to the higher expense levels in 2001 and 2000. However, since the operating systems and support operations related to Keystone, Premier and other acquisitions completed in earlier years have been combined with those of the Company, the Companys operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to the acquired operations or to the Company as it existed prior to each transaction. Components of other expense considered to be nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the operating expense totals noted above were amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of $122 million in 2001, $70 million in 2000 and $50 million in 1999; and merger related expenses of $8 million, $26 million and $5 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $435 million in 2001, an increase of 32% from $329 million in 2000 and 53% higher than the $285 million in 1999. Salaries and benefits related to acquired operations, merit salary increases, and higher expenses for incentive compensation arrangements and medical and other benefits were factors contributing to the increases in 2001 and 2000. The number of full time equivalent employees was 8,803 at December 31, 2001, compared with 8,219 and 6,171 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel expense totaled $384 million in 2001, 41% higher than $272 million in 2000 and 60% higher than $240 million in 1999. Higher expenses for equipment and occupancy; advertising, promotion and travel; amortization of capitalized servicing rights; and professional services and processing, all largely attributable to the impact of acquisitions, were significant factors contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel expenses from 2000 to 2001. Higher equipment and occupancy expenses, largely related to acquired operations, higher amortization of capitalized servicing rights and increased foreclosure related expenses contributed to the increase in expense from 1999 to 2000. 42 Table of Contents Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $206 million in 2001, compared with $160 million in 2000 and $153 million in 1999. The effective tax rates were 35.2% in 2001, 35.9% in 2000 and 36.5% in 1999. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets was $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Offshore deposits totaled $778 million at December 31, 2001 and $245 million at December 31, 2000. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, to fund operating costs, and to be used for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Historically, core deposits have been the most significant funding source for the Company. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers, which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 62% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2001, compared with 65% and 63% at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB and others. MT Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $5.0 billion at December 31, 2001. Outstanding borrowings under the FHLB credit facilities totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2001 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2000. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. MT Bank and MT Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2001 totaling approximately $1.3 billion. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at either December 31, 2001 or 2000. As previously noted, MT Bank issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated capital notes in October 2000 that provided liquidity and facilitated the acquisitions of Keystone and Premier. Informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the Company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings aggregated $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured within two business days. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt rating, or should the availability of 43 Table of Contents short term funding become restricted, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted. Information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in detail in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services. MTs primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, stockholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities is included in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. MT also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2001. A similar $30 million line of credit that expired during 2001 was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2000. Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either MT or its subsidiary banks. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the Company to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the Companys financial instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2001, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately $576 million. Information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Companys Asset Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken action, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or 44 Table of Contents off balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate risk management financial instruments. The accompanying table 14 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year. Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the Companys net interest income. The more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in rates of 100 and 200 basis points up and down during a twelve month period. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In accordance with industry practice, the accompanying table 15 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. The Company engages in limited trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities. Trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts, such as swaps. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the Asset Liability Committee. The notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled $1.4 billion and $242 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $769 million and $293 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000. The notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $39 million and $27 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $37 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000. 45 Table of Contents Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in notes 16 and 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2001 was $2.9 billion and represented 9.35% of total assets, compared with $2.7 billion or 9.33% at December 31, 2000 and $1.8 billion or 8.02% at December 31, 1999. Stockholders equity per share increased 8% to $31.33 at December 31, 2001 from $28.93 at December 31, 2000, and was 35% higher than $23.24 at December 31, 1999. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit intangible and applicable deferred tax balances, was $18.34 at December 31, 2001, compared with $16.74 at December 31, 2000 and $15.14 at December 31, 1999. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 9.60%, 8.59% and 8.24% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. MT issued shares of common stock in 2001, 2000 and 1999 to complete the acquisitions of Premier, Keystone and FNB, respectively. On February 9, 2001, MT issued 2,440,812 shares of common stock to former holders of Premier common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 224,734 shares of MT common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $176 million. To complete the acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000, MT issued 15,900,292 shares of common stock to former holders of Keystone common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 1,259,493 shares of MT common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $664 million. On June 1, 1999, MT issued 1,225,160 shares (stated to give effect to a ten for one stock split in 2000) of common stock to former holders of FNB common stock resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $59 million. Included in stockholders equity at December 31, 2001 was accumulated other comprehensive income, which reflected a gain of $23 million, or $.25 per common share, for the net after tax impact of unrealized gains on investment securities classified as available for sale, compared with unrealized losses of $432 thousand, or less than $.01 per share, at December 31, 2000, and $26 million, or $.34 per share, at December 31, 1999. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. Accumulated other comprehensive income also reflects an unrealized loss of $298 thousand, or less than $.01 per share, at December 31, 2001, representing the after tax effect of the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. On September 19, 2000, MTs Board of Directors authorized a ten for one split of MTs common stock in connection with the Keystone transaction. The additional shares were payable to stockholders of record as of September 29 and were distributed on October 5, 2000. The par value of each share of MTs common stock was reduced from $5.00 to $.50 in conjunction with the stock split. All per share data presented herein, including earnings, dividends and the number of common shares authorized, issued, issuable or held in treasury, have been adjusted to reflect the ten for one stock split. Also in connection with the Keystone transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2000 MT doubled the quarterly cash dividend payable on its common stock to $.25 on each post split share. 46 Table of Contents Cash dividends paid in 2001 on MTs common stock were $96 million, compared with $52 million and $35 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. As noted in the preceding paragraph, MT increased its quarterly dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of 2000 to $.25 per share from $.125 per share. In the third quarter of 1999, MTs quarterly common stock dividend rate was increased to $.125 per share from $.10 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $1.00 in 2001, up from $.625 in 2000 and $.45 in 1999. MT repurchased 4,396,303 shares of its common stock in 2001, 1,313,760 shares in 2000 and 1,678,330 shares in 1999, at a cost of $324 million, $55 million and $80 million, respectively. In November 2001, MT announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2001, MT had repurchased 624,513 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $71.70 per share. During 2001, MT completed previously authorized repurchase plans that had been announced in November 1999 and June 2001. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $318 million carrying value of trust preferred securities as described in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2001, total capital further included $559 million of subordinated notes issued by MT Bank in prior years. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are presented in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or cash net income (reduced by the impact of nonrecurring merger related expenses) less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 20.96% in 2001, 19.48% in 2000 and 19.89% in 1999. Fourth Quarter Results Net income for the fourth quarter of 2001 was $102 million, up 41% from $72 million in the final quarter of 2000. Diluted and basic earnings per share in the recent quarter were $1.05 and $1.08, respectively, compared with $.76 and $.78, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2000. Nonrecurring merger related expenses lowered net income by $14 million, or $.15 per share during 2000s fourth quarter. There were no similar expenses incurred during the last quarter of 2001. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets, net income for the recent quarter rose to 1.29% from 1.01% in 2000s fourth quarter. The annualized rate of return on average common stockholders equity in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 13.70%, compared with 11.03% in the corresponding quarter of 2000. Cash net income in the recent quarter increased 17% to $126 million from $108 million earned in the year earlier quarter. Diluted cash earnings per share rose 14% to $1.30 in 2001s final quarter from $1.14 in the fourth quarter of 2000. Cash return on average tangible assets was an annualized 1.67% in the recent quarter, up from 1.57% in the comparable 2000 quarter. Cash return on average tangible common equity rose to an annualized 29.43% in the fourth quarter of 2001 from 28.93% in the year earlier quarter. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased to $309 million in the final quarter of 2001, up 18% from $262 million in the year earlier period. A 10% increase in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin were the most significant factors contributing to the improvement in net interest income. Average earning assets were $28.2 47 Table of Contents billion and $25.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Average loans and leases for the recent quarter totaled $25.0 billion, an increase of 13% from $22.1 billion during the corresponding 2000 quarter. The impact of the previously described lower interest rate environment contributed to a significant increase in the Companys net interest margin to 4.34% in the final quarter of 2001 from 4.05% in 2000s fourth quarter. The yield on earning assets was 6.97% in the recent quarter, down 150 basis points from 8.47% in the year earlier period. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 3.03% in the final quarter of 2001, down 209 basis points from 5.12% in the comparable period of 2000. The resulting net interest spread was 3.94% in the recently completed quarter, compared with 3.35% in the final quarter of 2000. The provision for credit losses rose to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from $14 million in the year earlier period. Reflecting 2001s weakened economic conditions, net charge offs increased to $21 million in the recent quarter, compared with $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .33% in the final 2001 quarter, compared with .22% in the comparable quarter of 2000. Other income increased 24% to $128 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 from $103 million in the final quarter of 2000. Factors contributing to the increase in fourth quarter 2001 income include higher mortgage banking revenues, which rose 54% from the prior years fourth quarter, and increased service charges on deposit accounts, which were up 31% from the fourth quarter of 2000. As previously noted, a favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers led to the higher mortgage banking revenues. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was the result of higher transactional deposit account balances, which generate higher levels of service charges than non transactional accounts, and the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Additionally, there were no gains or losses from sales of investment securities in the recent quarter, while the final 2000 quarter reflected net losses of $3 million from sales of investment securities following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the investment portfolios of Keystone and the Company. Offsetting the impact of 2001s increases was a net gain of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2000 relating to leasing activities which resulted from a $13 million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual of $4 million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles leased to retail customers. Other expense increased 4% to $244 million in 2001s final quarter from $234 million in the comparable 2000 period. Nonrecurring merger related expenses totaled $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2000, while there were no similar expenses in the recently completed quarter. Contributing to the higher expenses in the fourth quarter of 2001 were salary costs, which rose $11 million or 11% from the final 2000 quarter. The higher salary expenses were the result of increased costs relating to incentive compensation arrangements, including commissions, merit salary increases and an increase in full time equivalent employees. Increased expenses for professional services and amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible also contributed to the higher expense level in the final quarter of 2001. Segment information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes 48 Table of Contents where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported segments and the financial results of such segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment earned net income of $114 million in 2001, up 15% from $98 million in 2000. The rise in earnings in 2001 reflects a $45 million, or 23%, increase in net interest income, due largely to a 25% increase in average loans and leases outstanding. Approximately one half of the increase in net interest income was attributable to operations in market areas related to the Keystone acquisition. Partially offsetting the higher net interest income was a $22 million increase in the provision for credit losses, resulting from higher net charge offs. Net income for this segment in 1999 was $78 million. The higher net income in 2000 when compared with 1999 resulted largely from an increase of $35 million, or 22%, in net interest income. Net interest income from loans and leases increased $24 million, as a result of a 23% increase in average balances outstanding, while the contribution to net interest income from deposits increased $8 million, due to a higher net interest spread and a 9% increase in average balances outstanding. Growth in most markets already served by the Company, as well as the impact of balances obtained in acquisitions, contributed to the higher loan and deposit levels in 2000. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Loans are largely secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in western New York, however, loans are also originated in the other regions in New York State, in Pennsylvania and, to a lesser extent, in Maryland, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings, office space, retail space, industrial space or other types of collateral. The Commercial Real Estate segments earnings increased 15% to $83 million in 2001 from $72 million in 2000. Higher net interest income of $22 million, the result of a 16% increase in average loan balances outstanding, was the major factor for the rise in net income. Approximately one third of the increase in net interest income was attributable to operations in market areas associated with the Keystone acquisition. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was $64 million in 1999. The major factor for the rise in net income from 1999 to 2000 was a 17% increase in average loan balances outstanding which contributed to a $12 million, or 10%, increase in net interest income. Loan growth in all markets served by the Company and the impact of commercial real estate loans obtained in the Keystone acquisition contributed to the increase in 2000s outstanding balances. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes securities, residential 49 Table of Contents mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swaps related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. Net income for the Discretionary Portfolio segment totaled $54 million in 2001, up from $34 million in 2000 and $38 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was due, in part, to a $10 million increase in tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance and a $14 million increase in net interest income, the result of increased balances of loans and investment securities and a higher net interest margin. Factors contributing to the decline in net income from 1999 to 2000 include an $11 million, or 23%, decrease in net interest income and losses from sales of bank investment securities of $3 million, offset, in part, by a $3 million increase in tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance. The decline in net interest income largely reflected a narrowing of the segments net interest margin. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of MT. The Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in New York State and Pennsylvania, as well as in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Washington. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. Net income for this segment was $44 million in 2001, up significantly from $6 million a year earlier and $21 million in 1999. The higher level of earnings in 2001 when compared with 2000 was largely due to the effects of substantially higher residential mortgage loan origination volumes, which resulted from a generally favorable interest rate environment for borrowers, and loan servicing fees. The higher loan origination volume in 2001 contributed to a $48 million, or 118%, increase in realized and unrealized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans, including sales to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of the Company, and loan servicing rights. The previously described adoption of SFAS No. 133 contributed approximately $8 million to such increase. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others, including the Discretionary Portfolio segment, increased by $15 million, or 34%, from 2000 to 2001. Net interest income was $33 million higher in 2001, predominately the result of a 152% increase in the average balance of loans held for sale. Reflecting the years higher revenues, operating expenses increased by 34%, from $106 million in 2000 to $142 million in 2001. The significant decrease in net income from 1999 to 2000 was largely due to lower gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, which decreased $15 million, and higher noninterest expenses of $6 million resulting from increases in foreclosure expenses and amortization of capitalized servicing rights. The decline in revenue resulted from the impact that generally higher interest rates in 2000 had on loan origination volume and from tighter pricing margins resulting from competitive pressures. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of consumer and small business services through several delivery channels which include traditional and in store banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through MT Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans and leases (both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $201 million in 50 Table of Contents 2001, up 23% from $164 million in 2000. Higher net interest income and deposit service charges of $158 million and $40 million, respectively, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $137 million, were the leading factors contributing to the improvement in net income from 2000. Such increases in income and expenses were largely the result of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. In 1999, this segments net income was $112 million. The increase from 1999 to 2000 was due largely to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2000 and 1999 that resulted in higher net interest income and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by increases in operating expenses. The full year impact in 2000 of a third quarter 1999 increase in fees charged for deposit account services also contributed to the improvement. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS Nos. 141 and 142. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, revised accounting standards and disclosure requirements for business combinations. All business combinations are now required to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting; use of the pooling of interests (pooling) method of accounting is prohibited. SFAS No. 141 requires that goodwill be initially recognized as an asset in the financial statements and measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net difference between amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The statement also requires that an acquired intangible asset be recognized apart from goodwill if that asset arises from contractual or other legal rights. SFAS No. 141 stipulates that the pooling method of accounting may not be used for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. However, prior business combinations accounted for by the pooling method are grandfathered. The provisions of SFAS No. 141 related to the application of the purchase method of accounting (including the separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets) were effective for any business combination completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, revises accounting standards for all purchased intangible assets but not the accounting for internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142, as amended, requires that most goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the same level or one level below an operating segment. All acquired goodwill should be assigned to reporting units, then tested for impairment no less frequently than annually. Acquired intangible assets (other than goodwill) should be amortized over their useful economic lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. However, an acquired intangible asset (other than goodwill) with an indefinite useful economic life should not be amortized until its life is determined to be finite. SFAS No. 142 also stipulates various disclosures and financial statement presentation requirements relating to goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and companies are required to perform the first impairment test on all goodwill within six months of initially applying the provisions of the statement. The useful economic life of previously recognized intangible assets should be reassessed upon adoption of the statement, remaining amortization periods should be adjusted accordingly, and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life should no longer be amortized. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Historically, the Company has referred to certain unidentifiable intangible assets acquired in branch acquisitions as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 does not change the accounting for such unidentifiable intangible assets that was 51 Table of Contents prescribed by SFAS No. 72, Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions. As a result, subsequent to December 31, 2001 the Company will continue to amortize such intangible assets along with core deposit and other acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense relating to core deposit and other intangible assets is expected to approximate $33 million (after tax) in 2002. The after tax impact of amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets in 2001 was $99 million. The Company is still evaluating whether or not any of its recorded goodwill should be considered impaired under the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Information about the Companys amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets during the three years ended December 31, 2001 is presented herein under the heading Cash Operating Results. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and supercedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of and the provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. SFAS No. 144 requires that long lived assets to be disposed of be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. As a result, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred. SFAS No. 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and, generally, are to be applied prospectively. The provisions of SFAS Nos. 143 and 144 are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
