Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments MT Bank Corporation (MT) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $33.2 billion at December 31, 2002. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects MT and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. MTs wholly owned bank subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (MT Bank) and MT Bank, National Association (MT Bank, N.A.). MT Bank, with total assets of $32.7 billion at December 31, 2002, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 449 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. MT Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. MT Banks subsidiaries include: MT Credit Corporation, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; MT Financial Corporation, a commercial leasing company; MT Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; MT Real Estate, Inc., a commercial mortgage lender; MT Securities, Inc., a broker/dealer; Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company; and Matthews, Bartlett Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency. MT Bank, N.A., with total assets of $626 million at December 31, 2002, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. MT Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products are offered by MT Bank, N.A. through banking offices of MT Bank. On September 26, 2002, MT entered into a definitive agreement with Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB), Dublin, Ireland, to acquire Allfirst Financial Inc. (Allfirst), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, and to merge it into MT. Upon completion of the merger, Allfirst Bank, Allfirsts primary banking subsidiary, will be merged into MT Bank. Allfirst Bank operates 258 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., Virginia and Delaware. At December 31, 2002, Allfirst had $17.0 billion in assets, including $10.4 billion of loans and leases and $2.6 billion of investment securities, and $15.3 billion of liabilities, including $11.3 billion of deposits. The merger was approved by the stockholders of both MT and AIB in December 2002 and, assuming approval by various regulatory agencies, is expected to be completed shortly after the end of the first quarter of 2003. Under the terms of the agreement between AIB and MT, AIB will receive 26.7 million shares of MT common stock (representing approximately 22.5% of MTs post merger outstanding common shares) and $886 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding Allfirst common shares. To fund a portion of the cash consideration and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios, MT Bank expects to issue up to $500 million of subordinated capital notes. Merger related expenses associated with the pending Allfirst acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2002 were not significant. On February 9, 2001, MT acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (Premier), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York. Premier National Bank, Premiers bank subsidiary, was merged into MT Bank on that date. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in the mid Hudson Valley region of New York State. As of the merger date, assets acquired totaled $1.8 billion, including $1.0 billion of loans and leases, and liabilities assumed were $1.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion of deposits. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier have been 32 Table of Contents included in MTs financial results subsequent to the acquisition date. Premiers stockholders received $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of MT common stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178 million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit intangible. On October 6, 2000, MT completed the acquisition of Keystone Financial, Inc. (Keystone), a bank holding company headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A., Keystones bank subsidiary, was merged into MT Bank on that date. Keystone Financial Bank, N.A. operated banking offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. As of the merger date, total assets acquired were $7.4 billion, including $4.8 billion of loans and leases and $1.2 billion of investment securities, and liabilities assumed were $6.4 billion, including $5.2 billion of deposits. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Keystone have been included in MTs financial results since the acquisition date. Keystones stockholders received $375 million in cash and 15,900,292 shares of MT common stock in exchange for the Keystone shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. The Company recorded approximately $475 million of goodwill and $121 million of core deposit intangible as a result of the Keystone acquisition. In connection with the acquisitions of Premier and Keystone, the Company incurred expenses associated with systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming the acquired operations with and into the operations of MT Bank. Such merger related expenses associated with the Premier and Keystone acquisitions totaled approximately $8 million ($5 million after tax) and $26 million ($16 million after tax) during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Those merger related expenses consisted largely of expenses for professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and or integration of operations; recruiting and other incentive compensation; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce MT Bank to customers; travel; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Premier and Keystone mergers were charges totaling $4 million and $30 million, respectively, net of applicable income taxes, for severance of former employees of the acquired entities; investment banking, legal and other professional fees; and termination of Premier and Keystone contracts for data processing and other services. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, unpaid merger related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill were insignificant. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends 33 Table of Contents are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail in notes 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations, is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information relating to a qualified special purpose trust that is not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview The Companys net income in 2002 totaled $485 million or $5.07 of diluted earnings per common share, up 28% and 33%, respectively, from $378 million or $3.82 per diluted share in 2001. Basic earnings per common share rose 33% to $5.25 in 2002 from $3.95 in 2001. Net income in 2000 totaled $286 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $3.44 and $3.55, respectively. The after tax impact of merger related expenses associated with the Keystone and Premier acquisitions was $5 million ($8 million pre tax) or $.05 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2001 and $16 million ($26 million pre tax) or $.20 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2000. There were no significant similar expenses in 2002. 34 Table of Contents Net income represented a return on average assets in 2002 of 1.52%, up from 1.23% in 2001 and 1.21% in 2000. The return on average common stockholders equity was 16.15% in 2002, 12.78% in 2001 and 14.07% in 2000. Excluding the impact of merger related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity were 1.24% and 12.94%, respectively, in 2001 and 1.28% and 14.88%, respectively, in 2000. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 revised accounting standards for all purchased intangible assets, but not the accounting for internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142, as amended, requires that most goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it periodically be tested for impairment. Other intangible assets assumed to have been acquired but with finite lives, such as core deposit intangible assets, are required to be amortized over their assumed lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002 the Company ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions. Amortization of such goodwill in 2001 and 2000, none of which was tax deductible, was $62 million ($.62 per diluted share) and $36 million ($.43 per diluted share), respectively. The after tax impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $32 million ($.34 per diluted share), $38 million ($.38 per diluted share) and $20 million ($.24 per diluted share), respectively. Pro forma net income, diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for 2001 and 2000, computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective in 2001 and 2000, were $440 million, $4.44 and $4.60 respectively, and $322 million, $3.87 and $3.99, respectively, while pro forma annualized returns on average assets and average common stockholders equity in 2001 were 1.43% and 14.87%, respectively, and in 2000 were 1.36% and 15.83%, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, for purposes of testing for impairment of goodwill the Company assigned all of its recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations and completed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of January 1, 2002. The Company determined that, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142, impairment of goodwill was not permitted or required as of January 1, 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company again performed an impairment test and concluded that no adjustment of the carrying value of goodwill was permitted or required as of that time. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had goodwill of $1.1 billion recorded as assets. Core deposit and other intangible assets at December 31, 2002 totaled $119 million, compared with $170 million a year earlier. On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. An entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge. Those methods must be consistent with the entitys approach to managing risk. The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment prescribed by SFAS No. 133 was not material to the Companys consolidated financial position or its results 35 Table of Contents of operations. As a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 133, effective January 1, 2001 hedged residential real estate loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale, and commitments to sell loans are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value, rather than at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value, which was the Companys policy prior to January 1, 2001. As a result of recording such items at estimated fair market value, the Company recognized approximately $8 million of additional mortgage banking revenues in 2001. If not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 133, such revenues would have generally been recognized in 2002 as the residential mortgage loans to which they related were sold. The impact on the Companys results of operations resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as related to the Companys use of interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was not significant. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 7% to $1.26 billion in 2002 from $1.18 billion in 2001, reflecting a widening of the Companys net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, and higher average earning assets, which increased 4% to $28.9 billion in 2002 from $27.8 billion in 2001. As a result of growth in the consumer loan portfolio, average loans and leases increased $1.1 billion or 4%, to $25.5 billion in 2002 from $24.4 billion in 2001. Net interest margin improved by 13 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.36% in 2002 from 4.23% a year earlier, due largely to the full year impact of the declining interest rate environment during 2001 and further changes in rates and spreads in 2002. A 29% increase in average earning assets in 2001, due in great part to the impact of loans obtained at the time of the acquisitions of Keystone and Premier, was the most significant factor contributing to the rise in that years net interest income from $865 million in 2000. Average loans and leases during 2001 rose $5.9 billion or 32% from $18.5 billion in 2000. A 21 basis point improvement in the net interest margin from 4.02% in 2000 also contributed to 2001s higher level of net interest income. Weakness in general economic conditions in 2002 and 2001, nationally and in the markets directly served by the Company, contributed to the Companys recognition of provisions for credit losses of $122 million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001, both up significantly from $38 million in 2000. Net charge offs totaled $108 million in 2002, up from $75 million in 2001 and $29 million in 2000. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding were .42%, .31% and .16% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Noninterest income totaled $512 million in 2002, up 7% from $477 million in 2001 and 58% higher than $325 million in 2000. Higher revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services significantly contributed to the rise in noninterest income from 2001 to 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to revenues related to operations in market areas associated with the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Growth in mortgage banking revenues, including the impact of adopting SFAS No. 133, and higher service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to 2001s increase in noninterest income. Noninterest operating expenses, which exclude merger related expenses and amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, aggregated $870 million in 2002, up from $819 million in 2001 and $599 million in 2000. Components of noninterest expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the noninterest operating expense totals were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $51 million in 2002, $60 million in 2001 and $34 million in 2000; amortization of goodwill of $62 million in 2001 and $36 million in 2000; and merger related expenses totaling $8 million in 2001 and $26 million in 2000. A provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $32 million and higher costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation, were large contributors to the 6% rise in operating expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001. Expenses related to the acquired operations of Keystone and Premier significantly contributed to the 37% increase in noninterest operating expense levels in 2001 compared with 2000. Also contributing to 36 Table of Contents 2001s higher expense levels were increased expenses for salaries and employee benefits, including incentive based compensation arrangements, advertising, professional and other services, and amortization of capitalized servicing rights. The efficiency ratio is a relative measure used by banking institutions that expresses noninterest operating expenses as a percentage of the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income. The efficiency ratio measures how much of a companys revenue is used to pay operating expenses. The Companys efficiency ratio, calculated using the operating expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income, was 49.0% in 2002, improved from 49.6% in 2001 and 50.2% in 2000. Cash Operating Results MT has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2000 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2000. Since the amortization of these acquired intangible assets does not result in a cash expense, MT believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on a cash, or tangible, basis (which excludes the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and the related asset balances) represents a relevant measure of financial performance, and, as a result of the required prospective application of SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002, provides meaningful comparative financial information. The supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of non cash operating expenses such as depreciation, provision for credit losses, provision for impairment of capitalized servicing rights, or deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations. Unless noted otherwise, cash basis data do, however, exclude the after tax impact of the previously described merger related expenses associated with acquisitions. Cash net income increased 7% to $518 million in 2002 from $482 million in 2001. Diluted and basic cash earnings per share in 2002 both increased by 11%, to $5.41 and $5.60, respectively, from $4.87 and $5.04, respectively, in 2001. In 2000, cash net income totaled $359 million, while diluted and basic cash earnings per share were $4.31 and $4.45, respectively. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, cash net income was 1.68% in 2002, improved from 1.63% in 2001 and 1.56% in 2000. Cash return on average tangible common equity was 28.62% in 2002, compared with 28.50% and 27.65% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Including the effect of merger related expenses, the cash return on average tangible assets for 2001 and 2000 was 1.62% and 1.49%, respectively, and the cash return on average tangible common equity was 28.22% and 26.38%, respectively. 37 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share, pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share (computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective in 2001 and 2000) and cash net income and diluted cash earnings per share follows: Year ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands, except per share) Net income $ 485,092 378,075 286,156 Amortization of goodwill 61,820 35,760 Pro forma net income 485,092 439,895 321,916 Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets(1) 32,491 37,525 20,325 Merger related expenses(1) 4,844 16,398 Cash net income $ 517,583 482,264 358,639 Diluted earnings per share $ 5.07 3.82 3.44 Amortization of goodwill .62 .43 Pro forma diluted earnings per share 5.07 4.44 3.87 Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets(1) .34 .38 .24 Merger related expenses(1) .05 .20 Diluted cash earnings per share $ 5.41 4.87 4.31 (1) After any related tax effect Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 7% to $1.26 billion in 2002 from $1.18 billion in 2001, largely the result of a widening of the Companys net interest margin and growth in average earning assets. The Companys average earning assets in 2002 were $28.9 billion, up 4% from $27.8 billion in 2001. The growth in such assets was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $25.5 billion in 2002, up 4% from 2001s average of $24.4 billion. Average outstanding balances of consumer loans and leases rose $1.2 billion, or 21%, from 2001 to 2002. Such growth, predominately in home equity lines of credit and automobile loans, more than offset declines in the commercial loan and lease and residential real estate loan portfolios. The lower average balances of commercial loans and leases were due in part to the sluggish economic conditions in the Companys core markets. The residential real estate loan portfolios decline was due largely to customer repayments of loans and the impact of a November 2002 securitization of approximately $1.1 billion of such loans. In connection with the securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $1.1 billion of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $140 million in cash and retained approximately 88% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a $5 million gain on the transaction which has been included in other noninterest income. In accordance with GAAP, the qualified special purpose trust is not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Additional information about this transaction and the qualified special purpose trust is included in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. 2001s taxable equivalent net interest income represented a 36% increase from $865 million in 2000, when average earning assets aggregated $21.5 billion. The increase in 2001s taxable equivalent net interest income was also largely the result of higher balances of average earning assets and a widening of the net interest margin. Average loans and leases in 2001 were 32% higher than 2000s average of $18.5 billion. The higher levels of loans and leases in 2001 reflect the impact of loans obtained in the Keystone and Premier mergers 38 Table of Contents as well as growth from new loan originations, net of customer repayments. On the October 6, 2000 acquisition date, Keystones loans totaled $4.8 billion and included $1.2 billion of commercial loans, $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans and $1.2 billion of consumer loans and leases. Loans obtained in the Premier acquisition on February 9, 2001 totaled $994 million and included $127 million of commercial loans, $317 million of commercial real estate loans, $356 million of residential real estate loans, and $194 million of consumer loans. Approximately one fourth of the increase in average loans and leases during 2001 as compared with 2000 was attributable to net loan origination activities. Of such increase, approximately $450 million was attributable to higher average balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale. The accompanying table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2002 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years. Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, totaled $5.3 billion at December 31, 2002, representing 21% of total loans and leases. The accompanying table 17 presents such commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2002 by geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Total commercial leases at December 31, 2002 were $148 million, of which 70% were secured by collateral located in New York State and 7% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania. Of the $5.2 billion of commercial loans outstanding at the 2002 year end, approximately $4.1 billion, or 79%, were secured, while 71% and 21% were granted to businesses in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 63% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2002, compared with 64% in 2001 and 65% in 2000. At December 31, 2002, the Company held approximately $9.7 billion of commercial real estate loans, $3.2 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $2.7 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $9.4 billion, $4.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are largely secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates, including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Hudson Valley and Southern Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in central Pennsylvania, Maryland, Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans, which represented approximately 42% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2002. The accompanying table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2002. Of the $4.2 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 37% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 22% by retail space and 14% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 47% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up approximately 36% of the total. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in New 39 Table of Contents York State and in Pennsylvania tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 76% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for $5 million or less. Approximately 76% of the outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania were also for $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New York State and Pennsylvania, and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 11% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2002. Of the $469 million of commercial construction loans presented in the accompanying table, $289 million represent loans for which the Company has also committed to provide permanent financing. Commercial construction loans represented 2% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2002. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2002, including approximately 47% secured by properties located in New York State and 17% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2002, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans were held for sale by MT Mortgage Corporation, the Companys residential mortgage banking subsidiary, compared with $1.0 billion at December 31, 2001. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $529 million at December 31, 2002, or approximately 2% of total loans and leases. Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 27% of the average loan portfolio during 2002, up from 23% during 2001 and 21% during 2000. Automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 80% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002 were secured by properties in New York State and 17% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2002, 36% and 40% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers, however, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 11% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2002, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 7%. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $556 million in 2002, $587 million in 2001 and $375 million in 2000. The increase from 2000 to 2001 reflects automobile leases acquired in the Keystone transaction that totaled $231 million on October 6, 2000. The accompanying table 18 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2002, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania and other states. Approximately 64% of total loans and leases at the 2002 year end were to New York State customers and 21% were to Pennsylvania customers. The investment securities portfolio averaged $3.1 billion in 2002, compared with $3.3 billion in 2001 and $2.8 billion in 2000. The previously discussed retention of mortgage backed securities related to the November 2002 securitization of $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans added approximately $147 million to average investment securities in 2002, which was more than offset by maturities and prepayments on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Investment securities obtained in the Keystone transaction totaled approximately $1.2 billion on October 6, 2000 and in the Premier transaction totaled $453 million on February 9, 2001. The impact on 2001 average balances of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions was approximately $359 million and $300 million, respectively. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial real estate mortgage backed securities, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. The Company has also invested 40 Table of Contents in debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions and short term commercial paper. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or following completion of a business combination. Money market assets, which are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks, interest earning trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities, averaged $291 million in 2002, compared with $80 million in 2001 and $239 million in 2000. The size of the investment securities and money market assets portfolios are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and money market assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by MT Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Average core deposits were $17.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, and $13.6 billion in 2000. The significant increase in average core deposits in 2001 was largely due to the full year impact of the $4.7 billion of core deposits obtained on October 6, 2000 in connection with the Keystone acquisition as well as the $1.2 billion of core deposits obtained on February 9, 2001 in connection with the Premier transaction. The Company experienced a significant shift in the composition of core deposits throughout 2001 and 2002, largely as a result of the low interest rate environment. Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average core savings and noninterest bearing deposits rose during 2001 and 2002, while average time deposits under $100,000 decreased in 2002. Average core deposits of MT Bank, N.A. were $342 million in 2002, $521 million in 2001 and $643 million in 2000. Funding provided by core deposits totaled 61% of average earning assets in 2002, compared with 63% in 2001 and 2000. The accompanying table 7 summarizes average core deposits in 2002 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.2 billion in 2002, compared with $2.0 billion in 2001 and $1.8 billion in 2000. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $569 million in 2002, compared with $327 million and $250 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Brokered time deposits, which have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings, averaged $1.9 billion in 2002, $794 million in 2001 and $696 million in 2000, and totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002. The weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at December 31, 2002 was 7 months. Certain of the brokered deposits have provisions that allow early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $270 million of brokered deposits. The Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts which averaged $59 million in 2002. Additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (together, the FHLB), and others as sources of funding. Short term borrowings 41 Table of Contents averaged $3.1 billion in 2002, $3.3 billion in 2001 and $2.7 billion in 2000. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short term borrowings averaged $904 million in 2002, $814 million in 2001 and $574 million in 2000. The remaining short term borrowings were predominately comprised of unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily. Additionally, in November 2002 the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to MT Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of MT Bank. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about MT Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average balance of long term borrowings was $4.2 billion in 2002, $3.5 billion in 2001 and $2.1 billion in 2000. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $3.0 billion in 2002, $2.4 billion in 2001 and $1.4 billion in 2000 and subordinated capital notes issued by MT Bank of $668 million in 2002, $674 million in 2001 and $295 million in 2000. The increase in the average balance of subordinated capital notes from 2000 to 2001 reflects MT Banks issuance of $500 million of 8% subordinated capital notes on October 5, 2000 in anticipation of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Trust preferred securities with a carrying value of $318 million that were issued in 1997 are also included in average long term borrowings. Information regarding trust preferred securities, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain interest rate swap agreements have been entered into by the Company as part of its management of interest rate risk relating to long term borrowings. Further information on such interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The Federal Reserve took numerous actions throughout 2001 to lower the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by 475 basis points. A further reduction of 50 basis points was initiated in November 2002. In general, such actions contributed to a greater decline in short term rates on deposits and borrowings as compared with the decline in yields on loans and other earning assets. The impact of changing interest rates had a positive effect on the Companys net interest spread, or the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, in 2002 and 2001. The yield on the Companys earning assets decreased 120 basis points to 6.42% in 2002 from 7.62% in 2001, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2002 was 2.39%, down 152 basis points from 3.91% in 2001. The impact of the more rapid repricing of interest bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the full year impact of the magnitude of 2001s interest rate reductions led to a 32 basis point increase in the Companys net interest spread, from 3.71% in 2001 to 4.03% in 2002. As a result of a decline in short term interest rates and a general steepening of the yield curve, the net interest spread in 2001 was also improved by 32 basis points as compared to a year earlier. In 2000, the net interest spread was 3.39%, the yield on earning assets was 8.30% and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 4.91%. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets that include goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Average net interest free funds totaled $4.0 billion in 2002, $3.7 billion in 2001 and $2.8 billion in 2000. The increases in average net interest free funds in 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 were largely the result of higher levels of noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity. Net interest free funds contributed .33% to net interest margin in 2002, compared with .52% in 2001 and .63% in 2000. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2002 and 2001 from 2000 resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $1.2 billion in 2002, $1.3 42 Table of Contents billion in 2001 and $766 million in 2000, while the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $604 million in 2002, $573 million in 2001 and $458 million in 2000. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 4.36% in 2002, improved from 4.23% in 2001 and 4.02% in 2000. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest margin and net interest income. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or, as appropriate, the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 2002 was $495 million. In general, under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates. However, under the terms of $100 million of swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate. In anticipation of the previously noted issuance of $500 million of fixed rate subordinated notes in October 2000, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements during September 2000, including forward starting swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $421 million. Under the terms of the terminated swap agreements, the Company would have made fixed rate payments and received variable rate payments. The termination of these swap agreements, which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed rate commercial real estate loans, resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately $15.5 million which is being recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the swaps. The impact on the Companys results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 from amortizing the net deferred gain was not significant. The amounts of net deferred gain to be recognized in future years is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2002, $395 million of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges and $100 million had been designated as cash flow hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in 2002 and 2001 was not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges was a gain of approximately $8 million at December 31, 2002 compared with a gain of $5 million at December 31, 2001. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by unrealized losses on the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately $1 million at December 31, 2002, compared with a loss of $461 thousand at December 31, 2001. Net of applicable income taxes, such losses were approximately $622 thousand and $298 thousand, respectively, and have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net in the Companys 43 Table of Contents consolidated balance sheet. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. Prior to the January 1, 2001 adoption of SFAS No. 133, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was not recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The unrecognized fair value associated with such interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2000 was a pre tax gain of approximately $1 million. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in the accompanying table 8. Provision For Credit Losses The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $122 million in 2002, up from $104 million in 2001 and $38 million in 2000. Continued weakness in general economic conditions across the United States, as a whole, and in markets directly served by the Company, contributed to net loan charge offs in 2002 and 2001 of $108 million and $75 million, respectively, up significantly from $29 million in 2000. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .42% in 2002, compared with .31% in 2001 and .16% in 2000. A summary of loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in the accompanying table 9. Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, totaled $215 million or .84% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2002, compared with $190 million or .76% at December 31, 2001 and $111 million or .49% at December 31, 2000. The higher level of nonperforming loans in 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 and earlier years reflects a prolonged weakness in the economy and its impact on the Companys customers. Nonperforming loans at the 2002 year end included three commercial loans totaling $49 million that were classified as such during 2002. The increase in nonperforming loans in 2001 from 2000 reflects two larger balance commercial loans totaling $40 million at 2001s year end that were classified as nonperforming during that year. The increase in nonperforming loans in 2000 largely reflects the impact of the Keystone acquisition. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $154 million or .60% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2002, compared with $147 million or .58% at December 31, 2001 and $142 million or .62% at December 31, 2000. Such loans included $123 million, $108 million and $93 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company and repurchased from the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies. The loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with them, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. In general, the remaining portion of accruing loans past due 90 days or more were either also guaranteed by government agencies or well secured by collateral. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data is presented in the accompanying table 11. Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations are based upon many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Such values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. 44 Table of Contents Net charge offs of commercial real estate loans in 2002 were $7 million, compared with $5 million in 2001. During 2000, the Company realized net recoveries of previously charged off commercial real estate loans of $383 thousand. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled $49 million at December 31, 2002, compared with $39 million and $37 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2002, net charge offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $54 million, compared with $32 million in 2001 and $6 million in 2000. The higher levels of charge offs in 2002 and 2001 compared with 2000 were largely a function of the sluggish economic environment faced by commercial customers throughout much of the past two years. Included in 2002s net charge offs was the entire $17 million outstanding balance of two leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of that year. Reflecting the weakened economy and the previously noted loans totaling $49 million and $40 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001 respectively, nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled $102 million at December 31, 2002 and $85 million a year earlier, compared with $26 million at December 31, 2000. Net charge offs of residential real estate loans were $5 million in 2002 and $4 million in 2001 and 2000. Residential real estate loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2002 totaled $37 million, compared with $35 million and $33 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due ninety days or more and accruing interest totaled $142 million, $135 million and $115 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As already highlighted, a substantial portion of such amounts relate to loans repurchased from GNMA which are fully guaranteed by government agencies. Net charge offs of consumer loans and leases were $42 million in 2002, representing .62% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the year, compared with $34 million or .61% in 2001 and $20 million or .50% in 2000. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Net indirect automobile loan and lease charge offs during 2002 were $21 million, compared with $12 million and $7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Consumer loans and leases classified as nonperforming totaled $27 million or .37% of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2002, compared with $31 million or .51% at December 31, 2001 and $15 million or .30% at December 31, 2000. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $3 million, $5 million and $21 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001s first quarter, the Company began classifying non guaranteed consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more as nonaccrual. Previously, such loans accrued interest until the loan balances were charged off. The change in classification did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or its financial condition. Despite the existence of loan collateral in many cases, management conservatively evaluated the collectability of delinquent consumer loans and leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the 45 Table of Contents Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) significant growth in loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components, which are described in the following paragraphs. The amount of specific loss components in the loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans. Specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $100,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimum delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes a ten point loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Items considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other factors; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national and local economic conditions and trends; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. 46 Table of Contents The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically New York State and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan product types, including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years; and, (v) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 further dampened the economic outlook for the United States, which in 2001 and 2002 experienced its first significant downturn in many years. The economies of New York State, and New York City in particular, were specifically damaged by the events of September 11, 2001. Economic growth outside of New York City, especially in the industrialized upstate New York markets, continues to lag most other regions of the country. The unemployment rate in New York State grew in 2002 and 2001, rising to 6.1% at December 31, 2002. Slow job growth, coupled with a declining population base, has left the upstate New York region susceptible to credit problems, particularly related to commercial customers. The central Pennsylvania economy has also remained depressed, with employment declining by an average of .5% in 2002, compared with a .1% increase in 2001. However, the regions job losses were roughly half the overall .9% average decrease for the United States in 2002. The accompanying table 10 presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components. At December 31, 2002, the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial loan and lease portfolio as a percentage of total loans was lower than a year earlier, largely due to a decrease in outstanding balances of classified loans having estimated inherent losses at those respective year ends. The increased allocation percentage for real estate loans at December 31, 2002 as compared with December 31, 2001 was the result of higher levels of classified loans in the commercial real estate portfolio. Increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 reflect weakened economic conditions and an increased level of impaired and other classified loans. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 increased to $164 million at December 31, 2002 from $140 million at December 31, 2001. Such impaired loans totaled $81 million at December 31, 2000. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans was $18 million and $21 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .19% and .24% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The slight decrease in the unallocated allowance 47 Table of Contents as a percentage of loans from the 2001 year end to December 31, 2002 reflects the modest impact of improving economic conditions at the recent years end. The effect of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the economic outlook at December 31, 2001 and in early 2002 diminished later in the year as indications of a gradual economic recovery emerged. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2002 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $436 million or 1.70% of total loans at December 31, 2002, compared with $425 million or 1.69% at December 31, 2001 and $375 million or 1.65% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 203%, 223% and 339%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. The increases in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 compared with December 31, 2000 also considered the weakened state of the economy in 2002 and 2001, as well as the other specific factors and conditions described herein. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 6% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2002. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2002. Furthermore, the Company had no exposure to less developed countries and less than $3 million of outstanding foreign loans at December 31, 2002. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $17 million at December 31, 2002, compared with $16 million a year earlier and $14 million at the end of 2000. Other Income Other income rose 7% to $512 million in 2002 from $477 million in 2001. Higher revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services significantly contributed to the increase from 2001. Other income in 2001 was 47% higher than the $325 million earned in 2000. Approximately 55% of such increase was attributable to the impact of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking revenues were also large contributors to the increase from 2000 to 2001. Mortgage banking revenues, which consist of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, increased 13% to $116 million in 2002 from $103 million in 2001. The higher revenues in 2002 were due to the impact of historically low levels of interest rates that produced a favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers. Mortgage banking revenues in 2001 were 63% higher than $63 million in 2000, also largely due to the impact of lower interest rates. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $5.7 billion in 2002, compared with $5.0 billion and $2.4 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and unrealized gains from recording residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans at fair market value aggregated $54 million and $50 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale be recorded in the Companys results of operations. 48 Table of Contents Such unrealized gains totaled approximately $15 million (pre tax) and $8 million (pre tax) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In general, unrealized gains are realized in subsequent periods as the related loans are sold. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, residential mortgage loans originated for sale and related commitments to sell loans and to originate loans for sale were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights totaled $25 million in 2000. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $53 million in 2002, up from $44 million in 2001 and $32 million in 2000. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2002, $11.0 billion at December 31, 2001 and $10.9 billion at December 31, 2000. Capitalized servicing assets, net of applicable valuation allowances for possible impairment, were $103 million, $107 million and $101 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additional information about the Companys capitalized servicing assets is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Service charges on deposit accounts grew 16% to $168 million in 2002 from $144 million in 2001. Services charges in 2001 were up 56% from $93 million in 2000. Higher transactional deposit account balances, which generate higher levels of service charges than non transactional accounts, contributed to the higher service charge income levels in 2002 and 2001. Fees for services provided to customers in areas formerly served by Keystone and Premier also contributed approximately 60% of the increase from 2000 to 2001. Reflecting general declines in market values of equity securities, trust income declined 7% to $60 million in 2002 from $64 million in 2001. Trust income in 2001 was 43% higher than 2000s $45 million due largely to the impact of the Keystone acquisition. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $43 million in 2002, an increase of 10% from $39 million in 2001 that resulted from higher revenues from sales of annuity products. Largely the result of the Keystone acquisition, brokerage services income in 2001 was up 20% from the $33 million of such income earned in 2000. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $3 million in 2002, $4 million in 2001 and $2 million in 2000. The Company sold bank investment securities resulting in losses of $608 thousand in 2002 and $3 million in 2000, compared with gains of $2 million in 2001. Losses in 2000 reflect $3 million of net losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 from sales of investment securities following the acquisition of Keystone and the combination of the investment portfolios of Keystone and the Company. All sold securities had been previously classified as available for sale for financial reporting purposes. Other revenues from operations totaled $122 million in 2002, compared with $120 million in 2001. The previously discussed $5 million gain on the sale of the 12% portion of the residential real estate loans that were securitized in November 2002 offset, in part, by lower benefits income from bank owned life insurance, contributed to the increase. Other revenues from operations were $92 million in 2000. Approximately two thirds of the increase from 2000 to 2001 resulted from activities and or market areas associated with the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. Other items that contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations in 2001 from 2000 include higher letter of credit and other credit related fees, insurance related revenues, and automated teller machine (ATM) usage fees. Other revenues from operations included $33 million, $35 million and $26 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Also included were revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees of $13 million in 2002 and 2001 and $9 million in 2000. Letter of credit and other credit related fees were $26 million, $24 million and $18 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Insurance related revenues totaled $15 million in 2002, compared with $13 million and $7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The impact of 49 Table of Contents acquisitions was the leading factor contributing to 2001s higher insurance related revenues as compared with 2000. ATM usage fees totaled $12 million in 2002, compared with $11 million in 2001 and $6 million in 2000. The increase in such usage fees from 2000 to 2001 was also largely the result of the Keystone transaction. Income from leasing activities in 2000 reflected a net gain of $9 million resulting from a $13 million gain from the sale of equipment previously leased to a commercial customer and an accrual of $4 million for losses associated with selling automobiles and other vehicles leased to retail customers. Other Expense Operating expenses, which exclude merger related expenses and amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, were $870 million in 2002, 6% higher than $819 million in 2001. A provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $32 million and higher costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation, largely contributed to the higher level of operating expenses in 2002. Operating expenses in 2001 were up 37% from $599 million in 2000. Expenses related to acquired operations significantly contributed to the higher expense levels in 2001 as compared with 2000. Components of other expense considered to be nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the operating expense totals noted above were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $51 million in 2002, $60 million in 2001 and $34 million in 2000; amortization of goodwill of $62 million and $36 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively; and merger related expenses of $8 million and $26 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $456 million in 2002, an increase of 5% from $435 million in 2001. The higher level of salaries and benefits expense in 2002 was largely the result of merit salary increases and higher commissions and incentive compensation costs. Also contributing to the rise in 2002s expense were higher pension costs, which rose from $2 million in 2001 to $6 million in 2002. Reflecting poor investment performance in recent years of assets held by the Companys funded pension plans, the Company contributed $19 million to such plans during the fourth quarter of 2002. That was the first pension plan contribution made by the Company since 1995. The Company anticipates that pension expense in 2003 will exceed 2002s expense by approximately $7 million (excluding the Allfirst transaction impact). Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Salaries and employee benefits expense rose 32% in 2001 from $329 million in 2000. Salaries and benefits related to acquired operations, merit salary increases, and higher expenses for incentive compensation arrangements and medical and other benefits were factors contributing to the increase. The number of full time equivalent employees was 8,726 at December 31, 2002, compared with 8,803 and 8,219 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel expense totaled $413 million in 2002, 8% higher than $384 million in 2001. Nonpersonnel expense was $272 million in 2000. The most significant factor contributing to the rise in such expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001 was the aforementioned $32 million provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Reflecting the impact on customer refinancings of outstanding mortgage loans that the low interest rate environment is expected to have on residential mortgage prepayment speeds, the Company recognized impairment of certain strata of residential mortgage loan servicing rights in 2002. There was no such provision for the years ended December 31, 2001 or 2000. Higher amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights also contributed to the higher 2002 expense level. Higher expenses for equipment and occupancy; advertising, promotion and travel; amortization of capitalized servicing rights; and professional services and processing, all largely attributable to the impact of acquisitions, were significant factors contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel expenses from 2000 to 2001. 50 Table of Contents Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $231 million in 2002, compared with $206 million in 2001 and $160 million in 2000. The effective tax rates were 32.3% in 2002, 35.2% in 2001 and 35.9% in 2000. The lower tax rate in 2002 was the result of the Company ceasing to amortize non deductible goodwill in connection with the implementation of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets was $6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Offshore deposits totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002 and $778 million at December 31, 2001. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, to fund operating costs, and to be used for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers, which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 60% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2002, compared with 62% and 65% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB and others. MT Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $5.1 billion at December 31, 2002. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $4.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. MT Bank and MT Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2002 totaling approximately $1.3 billion. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2002 or 2001. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $560 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of MT Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used to purchase additional automobile loans to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. MT Bank also issued $500 million of 8% fixed rate subordinated capital notes in October 2000 that provided liquidity and facilitated the acquisitions of Keystone and Premier. Informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the Company 51 Table of Contents through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings aggregated $2.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured within two days. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt rating, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. Information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services. MTs primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to MT are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2002 approximately $407 million was available for payment of dividends to MT from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. MT also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002. A similar $30 million line of credit that expired during 2002 was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2001. In connection with the pending acquisition of Allfirst, MT Bank expects to issue up to $500 million of subordinated capital notes. As a result, sufficient liquid assets are expected to be available to fund the cash portion of the consideration to be paid in connection with the acquisition. On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either MT or its subsidiary banks. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the Company to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. Therefore, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the Companys financial instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2002, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $495 million. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. 52 Table of Contents The Companys Asset Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for risk management purposes. The accompanying table 14 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in rates across repricing categories of 100 and 200 basis points up and down during a twelve month period. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, the accompanying table 15 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. The Company engages in limited trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the Asset Liability Committee, however, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counter parties to the Companys trading activities. 53 Table of Contents The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2002 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2001. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $290 million and $242 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $52 million and $36 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $39 million and $27 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in notes 17 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2002 was $3.2 billion or 9.59% of total assets, compared with $2.9 billion or 9.35% at December 31, 2001 and $2.7 billion or 9.33% at December 31, 2000. On a per share basis, stockholders equity increased 10% to $34.53 at the 2002 year end from $31.33 at December 31, 2001, and was 19% higher than $28.93 at December 31, 2000. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $21.75 at December 31, 2002, up from $18.34 a year earlier and $16.74 at December 31, 2000. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 9.41%, 9.60% and 8.59% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. MT issued shares of common stock in 2001 and 2000 to complete the acquisitions of Premier and Keystone, respectively. On February 9, 2001, MT issued 2,440,812 shares of common stock to former holders of Premier common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 224,734 shares of MT common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $176 million. To complete the acquisition of Keystone on October 6, 2000, MT issued 15,900,292 shares of common stock to former holders of Keystone common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 1,259,493 shares of MT common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $664 million. Included in stockholders equity was accumulated other comprehensive income which reflects the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale and the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities were $55 million, or $.60 per common share, at December 31, 2002 and $23 million, or $.25 per common share, at December 31, 2001. Unrealized losses, also net of tax effect, on similarly classified investment securities were $432 thousand, or less than $.01 per share, at December 31, 2000. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. Unrealized losses, net of tax effect, on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were $622 thousand and $298 thousand at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing less than $.01 per share at those respective dates. On September 19, 2000, MTs Board of Directors authorized a ten for one split of MTs common stock in connection with the Keystone transaction. The additional shares were payable to stockholders of record as of September 29 and were distributed on October 5, 2000. The par value of each share of MTs common stock was reduced from $5.00 to $.50 in conjunction with the stock split. All per share data presented herein, including earnings, dividends and the number of common shares authorized, issued, issuable or held in treasury, have been adjusted to reflect the ten for one stock split. Also in connection 54 Table of Contents with the Keystone transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2000 MT doubled the quarterly cash dividend payable on its common stock to $.25 on each post split share. Cash dividends paid in 2002 on MTs common stock were $97 million, compared with $96 million and $52 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. MT increased its quarterly dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of 2002 to $.30 per share from $.25 per share. As noted in the preceding paragraph, MTs quarterly common stock dividend rate was increased to $.25 per share from $.125 per share in the fourth quarter of 2000. Dividends per common share totaled $1.05 in 2002, up from $1.00 in 2001 and $.625 in 2000. MT repurchased 3,007,585 shares of its common stock in 2002, 4,396,303 shares in 2001 and 1,313,760 shares in 2000, at a cost of $240 million, $324 million and $55 million, respectively. In November 2001, MT announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2002, MT had repurchased a total of 3,632,098 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $78.49 per share. MT discontinued purchases of its common stock during the third quarter of 2002, determining instead that going forward it would use the Companys internal generation of capital to support the acquisition of Allfirst. During 2001, MT completed previously authorized repurchase plans that had been announced in November 1999 and June 2001. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $318 million carrying value of trust preferred securities as described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2002, total capital further included $540 million of subordinated notes issued by MT Bank in prior years. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 are presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or cash net income (reduced by the impact of merger related expenses) less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 21.42% in 2002, 20.96% in 2001 and 19.48% in 2000. Fourth Quarter Results The Companys net income was $126 million during the final quarter of 2002, up 24% from $102 million in the year earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.33 and $1.37, respectively, in 2002s final quarter, compared with $1.05 and $1.08, respectively, in the corresponding 2001 quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets, net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 improved to 1.51% from 1.29% in 2001s last quarter. The annualized rate of return on average common stockholders equity in the last three months of 2002 was 16.05%, up from 13.70% in the similar quarter of 2001. Cash net income in the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 5% to $133 million from $126 million earned in 2001s final quarter. Diluted cash earnings per share rose 8% to $1.40 in 2002s fourth quarter from $1.30 in the year earlier quarter. The annualized cash returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.65% and 27.38%, respectively, in the recent quarter, compared with 1.67% and 29.43%, respectively, in the comparable 2001 quarter. There were no significant merger related expenses incurred during the fourth quarters of 2002 or 2001. As previously noted, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002 the Company ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions. Amortization of such goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2001, none of which was tax deductible, was $16 million ($.16 per diluted share). 55 Table of Contents Amortization expense related to core deposit and other intangible assets was $7 million (after tax), or $.07 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with $9 million (after tax), or $.09 per diluted share, during the year earlier quarter. Pro forma net income, diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for last years fourth quarter, computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been in effect during 2001, were $117 million, $1.21 and $1.24 respectively. Pro forma annualized returns on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the final quarter of 2001 were 1.49% and 15.79%, respectively, after excluding the impact of goodwill amortization. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, up 5% from $309 million in the similar quarter of 2001. A 7% increase in average earning assets offset, in part, by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, resulted in the improvement in net interest income. Average earning assets were $30.1 billion and $28.2 billion in the final quarter of 2002 and 2001, respectively. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $25.9 billion, an increase of 3% from $25.0 billion during the year earlier quarter. Damping the year over year fourth quarter loan growth was the November 2002 securitization of $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans already discussed. The yield on earning assets was 6.08% in the final three months of 2002, down 89 basis points from 6.97% in the comparable 2001 period. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 2.09% in the fourth quarter of 2002, down 94 basis points from 3.03% in the comparable period of 2001. The resulting net interest spread was 3.99% in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with 3.94% in the corresponding 2001 period. A decrease in the imputed contribution of interest free funds in the final 2002 quarter more than offset the improved net interest spread. As a result, the Companys net interest margin declined to 4.28% in the fourth quarter of 2002 from 4.34% in the year earlier quarter. The provision for credit losses was $33 million in the final quarter of both 2002 and 2001. Net charge offs increased to $31 million in the recent quarter from $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .48% in the final 2002 quarter, compared with .33% in the corresponding 2001 period. Other income increased 8% to $138 million in the final quarter of 2002 from $128 million in the year earlier period. The major factors contributing to the higher level of income were increased mortgage banking revenues, which rose 28% from the prior years corresponding quarter, and higher service charges on deposit accounts, which were up 15% from the last three months of 2001. As previously noted, a favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers, including the lowest residential mortgage interest rates in over 40 years, led to the higher mortgage banking revenues. Operating expenses, which as previously discussed exclude merger related expenses and the amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, rose $14 million or 7% to $229 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 from $215 million in the year earlier period. A $13 million provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in 2002s final quarter and higher salary costs relating to incentive compensation arrangements and merit salary increases were the predominant contributors to the higher level of operating expenses in the 2002 period. Segment information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. 56 Table of Contents The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets the Company serves. Among the services provided by this segment are commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment contributed $103 million to the Companys earnings in 2002, down from $109 million in 2001. The decline in net income from 2001 was attributable to a $14 million decrease in net interest income, due to a 26 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin, partially offset by a $4 million increase in deposit service charges. Earnings for this segment totaled $96 million in 2000. The rise in earnings in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflects a $42 million, or 22%, increase in net interest income, due largely to a 25% increase in average loans and leases outstanding. Approximately one half of the increase in net interest income was attributable to operations in market areas related to the Keystone acquisition. Partially offsetting the higher net interest income was a $23 million increase in the provision for credit losses, resulting from higher net charge offs. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Loans are largely secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in western New York, however, loans are also originated in the other regions in New York State, in Pennsylvania and, to a lesser extent, in Maryland, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment was $93 million in 2002, up 7% from $87 million in 2001. The increase was due largely to an $11 million increase in net interest income, the result of a 12 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans and a 5% increase in average loan balances outstanding. Net income for this segment was $74 million in 2000. Higher net interest income of $25 million, led by a 18% increase in average loan balances outstanding, was the major factor for the rise in net income from 2000 to 2001. Approximately one quarter of the increase in net interest income was attributable to operations in market areas associated with the Keystone acquisition. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swaps related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. Net income contributed by the Discretionary Portfolio segment totaled $65 million in 2002, up 21% from $54 million in 2001. The higher net income in 2002 was predominately the result of an $18 million increase in net interest income, largely the result of a 34 basis point rise in the net interest margin on investment securities. Net income for the Discretionary Portfolio was $34 million in 2000. The increase from 2000 to 2001 was due, in part, to a $9 million rise in tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance and a $14 million increase in net interest income, the result of increased balances of loans and investment securities and a 4 basis point increase in net interest margin. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of MT. In 57 Table of Contents addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states in the western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segments net income for 2002 was $39 million, down 12% from $44 million in 2001. The decrease from the previous year was attributable to a $29 million increase in the provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights and a $19 million increase in salaries, commissions and other operating expenses, offset in large part by a $27 million increase in net interest income, the result of a higher loan net interest margin and higher balances outstanding; increased loan servicing revenues of $7 million, largely the result of purchased servicing rights; and a $6 million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities, including gains from sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment. In 2000, this segments net income was $6 million. The higher level of earnings in 2001 when compared with 2000 was largely due to the impact of lower interest rates. Higher loan origination volume in 2001 contributed to a $48 million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities, including sales to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of the Company. The previously described adoption of SFAS No. 133 contributed approximately $8 million to such increase. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others, including the Discretionary Portfolio segment, increased by $15 million from 2000 to 2001. Net interest income in 2001 was $33 million higher than in 2000, predominately the result of an increase in loan balances outstanding. Reflecting the years higher revenues, 2001s operating expenses increased by $36 million, or 34%, from 2000. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of consumer and small business services through several delivery channels which include traditional and in store banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through MT Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans and leases (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $163 million in 2002, down 19% from $201 million in 2001. A $44 million reduction in net interest income was a significant contributor to the decline in net income. The reduced net interest income reflects an $82 million decline that resulted from a lower deposit net interest margin of 42 basis points that was largely attributable to the impact of the years low interest rate environment and a 6% decline in retail deposit balances. Partially offsetting this decline was higher loan net interest income of $38 million, primarily the result of a 14% increase in average loan balances outstanding. Also contributing to the lower earnings was a $15 million increase in the provision for credit losses and increased operating expenses of $22 million, offset, in part, by an $18 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts. Net income for this segment in 2000 was $164 million. Higher net interest income and service charges on deposit accounts of $158 million and $40 million, respectively, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $137 million, were the leading factors contributing to the improvement in net income from 2000. Such increases in income and expenses during 2001 were largely the result of the Keystone and Premier acquisitions. The All Other category consists largely of other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131. Included in this category are the amortization of goodwill (prior to 2002) and core deposit and other intangible assets, merger related expenses resulting from acquisitions, and the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. This category also includes the previously 58 Table of Contents described charge off of $17 million during the third quarter of 2002 related to two commercial leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy protection. The various components comprising the All Other category resulted in net income of $22 million in 2002, compared with net losses of $117 million and $88 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement from 2001 was due to the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing, combined with the cessation of amortization of goodwill resulting from the January 1, 2002 adoption of SFAS No. 142, offset, in part, by the commercial lease charge off. The decrease in net contribution in 2001 from 2000 was largely due to increases in the amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and other expenses relating to the Keystone and Premier acquisitions, and the effects of the Companys allocation methodologies. Recent Accounting Developments In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Recission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 addresses a number of different issues and is effective at various dates in 2002 and 2003, with earlier application encouraged. None of the provisions of SFAS No. 145 had or are expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. SFAS No. 142 does not apply to costs associated with an exit activity that involves an entity newly acquired in a business combination. The Company believes that adopting SFAS No. 146 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, but that adoption could affect the timing of when certain costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized. In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 147, Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions. SFAS No. 147 amends SFAS No. 72, SFAS No. 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9, and clarifies that acquisitions of all or part of financial institutions, including branch acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, should be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 147 requires that if an acquisition is not a business combination because the transferred net assets and activities do not constitute a business, that transaction shall be accounted for as an acquisition of net assets that does not result in the recognition of non amortizing goodwill, in accordance with paragraphs 4 8 of SFAS No. 141. The provisions of SFAS No. 147 relating to the application of the purchase method of accounting are effective for acquisitions for which the date of acquisition is on or after October 1, 2002. The provisions related to 59 Table of Contents accounting for the impairment or disposal of certain long term customer relationship intangible assets were effective on October 1, 2002. Transition provisions for previously recognized unidentifiable intangible assets were effective on October 1, 2002, with earlier application permitted. The adoption of SFAS No. 147 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, was issued in November 2002. FASB Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has complied with the required disclosure requirements in its 2002 annual financial statements. The Company adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45 effective January 1, 2003. Such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. If an entity elects to adopt the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 148 for stock based compensation in a fiscal year beginning before December 16, 2003, that change in accounting principle must be reported using any one of three methods, as follows: 1) Prospective method. The recognition provisions must be applied to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied. 2) Modified prospective method. Stock based employee compensation cost must be recognized from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method specified in SFAS No. 123 had been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. 3) Retroactive restatement method. All periods presented must be restated to reflect stock based employee compensation cost under the fair value based accounting method specified in SFAS No. 123 for all employee awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. Restatement of periods prior to those presented is permitted but not required. The amendments to SFAS No. 123 as provided in SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, while the interim reporting requirements are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, effective January 1, 2003 using the retroactive restatement method. Information regarding the impact of such adoption on the Companys consolidated financial statements is included in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued in January 2003. FASB Interpretation No. 46 clarifies 60 Table of Contents the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FASB Interpretation No. 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected returns if they occur, or both. It also requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity make certain disclosures. FASB Interpretation No. 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company has provided the required transition disclosures with respect to its involvement with variable interest entities in notes 4, 9, and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company does not expect to change its accounting for its existing interests in variable interest entities upon adoption of the consolidation provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46.
