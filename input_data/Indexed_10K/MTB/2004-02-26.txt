Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments MT Bank Corporation (MT) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $49.8 billion at December 31, 2003. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects MT and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. MTs wholly owned bank subsidiaries are Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (MT Bank) and MT Bank, National Association (MT Bank, N.A.). MT Bank, with total assets of $49.2 billion at December 31, 2003, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 683 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. MT Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. MT Banks subsidiaries include: MT Credit Corporation, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; MT Financial Corporation, a commercial leasing company; MT Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; MT Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; MT Realty Capital Corporation, a multi family commercial mortgage lender; MT Securities, Inc., a broker/dealer; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; Highland Lease Corporation, a consumer leasing company; and Matthews, Bartlett Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency. MT Bank, N.A., with total assets of $473 million at December 31, 2003, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. MT Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products are offered by MT Bank, N.A. through banking offices of MT Bank. On April 1, 2003, MT completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. (Allfirst), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, from Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB), Dublin, Ireland. Allfirst Bank, Allfirsts primary bank subsidiary, was merged into MT Bank on that date. Allfirst Bank operated 269 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia at the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Allfirst represented a major geographic expansion by MT and created a strong Mid Atlantic banking franchise. AIB received 26,700,000 shares 32 Table of Contents of MT common stock and $886 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding Allfirst common shares. Immediately after the completion of the acquisition, AIB owned approximately 22.5% of the outstanding shares of MTs common stock. The results of operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since April 1, 2003. Table 1 provides a summary of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company on April 1, 2003 in connection with the Allfirst transaction. Merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $60 million ($39 million after tax effect). Such expenses were for professional services and temporary help associated with the conversion of systems and or integration of operations; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce MT Bank to Allfirsts customers; travel and relocation costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. The Company does not expect to incur any significant additional merger related expenses relating to the Allfirst transaction. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Allfirst merger were charges totaling $29 million, net of applicable income taxes ($48 million before tax effect), for severance costs for former Allfirst employees; investment banking and other professional fees; and termination of Allfirst contracts for various services. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining unpaid portion of merger related expenses and charges included in the determination of goodwill were $1 million and $13 million, respectively. The resolution of Allfirsts preacquisition contingencies in future periods could have an impact on the allocation of the purchase price and the amount of goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition, however, management does not presently expect that any such adjustments will be material to the Companys consolidated balance sheet. In anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, MT Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. The subordinated notes are included in regulatory capital of MT and MT Bank. The notes pay interest semi annually on April 1 and October 1. The interest rate is fixed at 3.85% through March 31, 2008, with a floating rate payable from April 1, 2008 through the maturity date based on the then applicable U.S. dollar three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.50%. The notes will mature on April 1, 2013. Beginning on April 1, 2008, MT Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the subordinated notes on any interest payment date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the redeemed principal, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. On February 9, 2001, MT acquired Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (Premier), a bank holding company headquartered in Lagrangeville, New York. Premier National Bank, Premiers bank subsidiary, was merged into MT Bank on that date. Premier National Bank operated 34 banking offices in the mid Hudson Valley region of New York State. As of the merger date, assets acquired totaled $1.8 billion, including $1.0 billion of loans and leases, and liabilities assumed were $1.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion of deposits. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations acquired from Premier have been included in MTs financial results subsequent to the acquisition date. Premiers stockholders received $171 million in cash and 2,440,812 shares of MT common stock in exchange for the Premier shares outstanding at the time of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $178 million of goodwill and $32 million of core deposit intangible. In 2001, the Company incurred expenses associated with systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming the acquired operations of Premier and of Keystone Financial Inc. (Keystone), which was acquired on October 6, 2000, with and into the operations of MT Bank. Such merger related expenses totaled approximately $8 million ($5 million after tax) during the year ended December 31, 2001. 33 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail in this Financial Review and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information 34 Table of Contents regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held in trusts or other so called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview The Companys net income in 2003 totaled $574 million or $4.95 of diluted earnings per common share, up 26% and 4%, respectively, from $457 million or $4.78 per diluted share in 2002. Basic earnings per common share rose 3% to $5.08 in 2003 from $4.94 in 2002. The after tax impact of merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition was $39 million ($60 million pre tax) or $.34 of diluted earnings per share and $.35 of basic earnings per share in 2003. There were no significant similar expenses in 2002. Net income in 2001 totaled $353 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $3.58 and $3.69, respectively. The after tax impact of merger related expenses associated with the Premier and Keystone acquisitions was $5 million ($8 million pre tax) or $.05 of diluted and basic earnings per share in 2001. Net income represented a return on average assets in 2003 of 1.27%, compared with 1.43% in 2002 and 1.14% in 2001. The return on average common stockholders equity was 11.62% in 2003, 15.09% in 2002 and 11.87% in 2001. Excluding the impact of merger related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity were 1.35% and 12.41%, respectively, in 2003 and 1.16% and 12.03%, respectively, in 2001. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began recognizing expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2003 included $43 million of stock based compensation. After tax effect, stock based compensation lowered 2003s net income by $32 million, or $.27 per diluted share. Using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, financial information for all prior periods presented in this annual report has been restated to reflect the impact of recognizing expense for stock based compensation in those years as well. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2002 has been restated to include $41 million of stock based compensation, resulting in a reduction of previously reported net income of $28 million. Diluted earnings per share noted herein for 2002 have been reduced by $.29 from the amount previously reported. For 2001, the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123 using the retroactive restatement method was to increase salaries and employee benefits expense by approximately $32 million, resulting in a reduction of previously reported net income of $25 million or $.24 of diluted earnings per share. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 revised accounting standards for all purchased intangible assets, but not the accounting for internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142, as amended, requires that most goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it periodically be tested for impairment. Other intangible assets assumed to have been acquired but with finite lives, such as core deposit intangible assets, are required to be amortized over their assumed lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002 the Company ceased amortization of goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions. Amortization of such goodwill in 2001, none of which was tax deductible, was 35 Table of Contents $62 million ($.62 per diluted share). The after tax impact of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $48 million ($.41 per diluted share), $32 million ($.34 per diluted share) and $38 million ($.38 per diluted share), respectively. Pro forma net income, diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for 2001, computed as if SFAS No. 142 had been effective in 2001, were $415 million, $4.20 and $4.33, respectively, while pro forma annualized returns on average assets and average common stockholders equity in 2001 were 1.35% and 13.95%, respectively. Further information regarding the allocation of goodwill to the Companys reportable segments and results of impairment tests of such goodwill is provided in note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. Net interest income recorded on a taxable equivalent basis increased 28% to $1.62 billion in 2003 from $1.26 billion in 2002, reflecting higher average earning assets, which increased 37% to $39.5 billion in 2003 from $28.9 billion in 2002. The higher levels of average earning assets in 2003 as compared with 2002 were largely the result of loans, leases and investment securities obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average loans and leases increased $8.5 billion, or 33%, to $34.0 billion in 2003 from $25.5 billion in 2002. Included in the 2003 average was the nine month impact of the $10.3 billion of Allfirst related loans and leases acquired on April 1, 2003. Partially offsetting the impact of the higher levels of average earning assets in 2003 was a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Net interest margin declined 27 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 4.09% in 2003 from 4.36% a year earlier, due largely to lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities acquired in the Allfirst transaction. A widening of the Companys net interest margin and higher average earning assets, which rose $1.1 billion or 4% from $27.8 billion in 2001, were the most significant factors contributing to the increase in 2002s taxable equivalent net interest income from $1.18 billion in 2001. Net interest margin in 2002 was 13 basis points higher than 4.23% in 2001, due to the full year impact of 2001s declining rate environment and further changes in rates and spreads in 2002. The 4% rise in average earning assets from 2001 to 2002 was the result of growth in the consumer loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $131 million in 2003, $122 million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001. Net charge offs totaled $97 million in 2003, compared with $108 million in 2002 and $75 million in 2001. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding were .28%, .42% and .31% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net charge offs of loans acquired from Allfirst were not significant during the final nine months of 2003. The provision in each year reflects the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans. Noninterest income aggregated $831 million in 2003, 62% higher than $512 million in 2002 and up 74% from $477 million in 2001. Approximately $279 million of the increase from 2002 was attributable to revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the improvement. Increased revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services were significant contributors to the rise in noninterest income from 2001 to 2002. Noninterest expense in 2003 totaled $1.45 billion, 51% higher than $962 million in 2002 and up 48% from $981 million in 2001. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $78 million, $51 million and $60 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively; amortization of goodwill of $62 million in 2001; and merger related expenses of $60 million and $8 million in 2003 and 2001, respectively. There were no merger related expenses in 2002. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest 36 Table of Contents operating expenses aggregated $1.31 billion in 2003, compared with $910 million in 2002 and $851 million in 2001. Expenses related to operations formerly associated with Allfirst significantly contributed to the higher level of expenses in 2003 compared with 2002, along with higher expenses for salaries and benefits, professional services and amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting these higher expenses was a $30 million decrease in the provision for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which was $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. The $32 million provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and higher costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation, were large contributors to the rise in noninterest operating expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001. The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment securities), was 53.6% in 2003, compared with 51.3% in 2002 and 51.5% in 2001. The higher ratio in 2003 reflects the impact of the acquired Allfirst operations that are now part of MT. Supplemental Reporting of Non GAAP Results of Operations MT has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.1 billion at December 31, 2003, $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2003, up from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001 due to the Allfirst acquisition. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, was $48 million, $32 million and $38 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The higher level of such amortization in 2003 as compared with 2002 and 2001 was due to the impact of core deposit and other intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of Allfirst. Since 1998 MT has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which MT excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, because such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by MT is not a GAAP measure, MTs management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Net operating income rose 35% to $661 million in 2003 from $489 million in 2002. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2003 increased 11% to $5.70 from $5.12 in 2002. In 2001, net operating income totaled $457 million and diluted net operating earnings per share were $4.63. A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share is presented in table 3. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, net operating income was 1.55% in 2003 and 2001, compared with 1.59% in 2002. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 28.49% in 2003, compared with 26.71% and 26.76% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Including the effect of merger related expenses, net operating return on average tangible assets for 2003 and 2001 was 1.46% and 1.53%, respectively, and net operating return on average tangible common equity was 26.80% and 26.48%, respectively. 37 Table of Contents A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity is presented in table 3. Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 28% to $1.62 billion in 2003 from $1.26 billion in 2002. The improvement reflects a 37% increase in average earning assets to $39.5 billion in 2003 from $28.9 billion in 2002, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin. The growth in average earning assets was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $34.0 billion in 2003, up 33% from 2002s average of $25.5 billion. The most significant factor for the higher loan balances in 2003 was the nine month impact of the $10.3 billion of loans obtained in the Allfirst acquisition on April 1, 2003. Such acquired loans were comprised of approximately $4.5 billion of commercial loans and leases (including $314 million of leveraged leases and $230 million of loans to foreign borrowers), $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million of residential real estate loans and $2.9 billion of consumer loans and leases. Average consumer loans and leases, excluding those acquired in the Allfirst transaction, grew 20% to $8.2 billion in 2003 from $6.8 billion in 2002. Increases in the outstanding average balances of automobile loans and leases of $1.0 billion and home equity lines of credit of $495 million were the leading contributors to that growth. Partially offsetting the growth noted above was a decline in the residential real estate loan portfolio, due largely to customer repayments of loans and the impact of two separate securitization transactions totaling $1.3 billion of such loans during 2003s fourth quarter and the full year impact of a similar $1.1 billion securitization in the fourth quarter of 2002. In connection with the first 2003 securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $838 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $112 million in cash and retained approximately 87% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $1 million on the transaction which has been included in other revenues from operations. In 2003s second securitization transaction, approximately $441 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans were converted to mortgage backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). All of those mortgage backed securities were retained by the Company and, accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized. In total, approximately $1.2 billion of mortgage backed securities resulting from 2003s securitization transactions were retained by the Company and included in the portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale. Taxable equivalent net interest income in 2002 was 7% higher than $1.18 billion in 2001, when average earning assets aggregated $27.8 billion. A 4% increase in average loans and leases from 2001 to 2002, coupled with a widening of the Companys net interest margin, were the most significant factors for the higher level of taxable equivalent net interest income in 2002 as compared with 2001. Average outstanding balances of consumer loans and leases rose $1.2 billion, or 21%, from 2001 to 2002. Such growth, predominantly in outstanding home equity lines of credit and automobile loans, more than offset declines in the commercial loan and lease and residential real estate loan portfolios. The lower average balances of commercial loans and leases were due in part to the sluggish economic conditions in the Companys core markets. The residential real estate loan portfolios decline was due largely to customer repayments of loans and the impact of the November 2002 securitization of approximately $1.1 billion of such loans. Similar to one of the securitizations already discussed, in connection with 38 Table of Contents the 2002 securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $1.1 billion of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $140 million in cash and retained approximately 88% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $5 million on the transaction which has been included in other revenues from operations. In accordance with GAAP, the qualified special purpose trusts related to the 2003 and 2002 mortgage loan securitization transactions are not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the resulting mortgage backed securities provide enhanced liquidity opportunities to the Company because the securities may be more readily pledged to secure borrowings or sold than the underlying loans could be. Additionally, under present regulatory risk based capital rules, the Company is generally required to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital when directly investing in residential real estate loans than when investing in government guaranteed or highly rated, privately placed mortgage backed securities. Additional information about these transactions and the qualified special purpose trusts is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information about the Companys regulatory capital requirements is included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2003 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years. Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, totaled $9.2 billion at December 31, 2003, representing 26% of total loans and leases. Table 6 presents such commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2003 by geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. As already mentioned, commercial loans and leases obtained in the Allfirst transaction totaled $4.5 billion on April 1, 2003, including $314 million of leveraged leases. Included in the Allfirst loan and lease portfolio were certain business lines in which the Company has not traditionally been active. An international maritime portfolio, which at April 1 and December 31, 2003 totaled $113 million and $71 million, respectively, was acquired. The Company does not expect to grow this specialized business. Other international loans attributable to Allfirst totaled $132 million and $145 million at April 1 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balance of loans under this program at December 31, 2003 was $123 million. Commercial leases obtained on April 1, 2003 from Allfirst totaled $610 million, and consisted of general equipment leases with an emphasis on transportation equipment, including railcars, tractors, trailers and commercial aircraft. The Company does not expect to pursue growing the commercial aircraft component of the lease portfolio. The Companys commercial aircraft lease portfolio totaled $99 million at December 31, 2003, including $70 million that was obtained from Allfirst. Of the $9.2 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the 2003 year end, approximately $7.2 billion, or 78%, were secured, while 46%, 26% and 12% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 58% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2003, compared with 63% in 2002 and 64% in 2001. At December 31, 2003, the Company held approximately $12.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $3.1 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $5.0 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $9.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2002. As of April 1, 2003, loans obtained in the Allfirst acquisition that were secured by real estate aggregated $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million 39 Table of Contents of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $2.3 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates, including the Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Hudson Valley and Southern Tier regions. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans obtained in the Allfirst transaction were geographically centered in Allfirsts regional marketplace, with the majority of that portfolio secured by properties in Maryland, south central Pennsylvania, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans, which represented approximately 45% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2003. Table 7 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2003. Of the $4.3 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 37% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 24% by retail space and 10% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up approximately 32% of the total. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 74% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 74% and 63%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 10% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2003. MT Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by third party investors and subsequently sold to such investors. The Companys involvement with the FNMA DUS program resulted from the Allfirst acquisition. At December 31, 2003, $1 million of commercial real estate loans were held for sale. Commercial construction loans presented in table 7 totaled $940 million at December 31, 2003, or approximately 3% of total loans and leases. 40 Table of Contents Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2003, including approximately 43% secured by properties located in New York State and 17% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania. As already discussed, residential real estate loans obtained in the Allfirst transaction totaled $383 million on April 1, 2003. At December 31, 2003, $723 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002. Loans to finance the construction of or development projects related to one to four family residential properties totaled $597 million at December 31, 2003, or approximately 2% of total loans and leases. Included in such construction loans were loans to residential real estate developers aggregating $246 million. Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 30% of the average loan portfolio during 2003, up from 27% during 2002 and 23% during 2001. Automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 60% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2003 were secured by properties in New York State and 22% and 15% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. At December 31, 2003, 31% and 40% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, however, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 12% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2003, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 8%. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $527 million in 2003, $556 million in 2002 and $587 million in 2001. During 2003 the Company decided to cease origination of automobile leases concentrating instead on its larger automobile loan origination business. Given the growth in the Companys automobile loan portfolio, the decision to cease origination of new auto leases did not have a significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, outstanding automobile leases totaled $425 million and $527 million, respectively. Table 8 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2003, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 49% of total loans and leases at the 2003 year end were to New York State customers, while 25% and 11% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively. Investment securities averaged $5.3 billion in 2003, compared with $3.1 billion in 2002 and $3.3 billion in 2001. The previously discussed retention of mortgage backed securities related to the fourth quarter 2003 and 2002 securitizations of residential real estate loans of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, added approximately $817 million to average investment securities in 2003. Investment securities obtained in the Allfirst transaction totaled approximately $1.3 billion on April 1, 2003 and contributed approximately $887 million of 2003s average balance of investment securities. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. Average money market assets, which are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks, interest earning trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities, totaled $216 million in 2003, compared with $291 million in 2002 and $80 million in 2001. The amounts of investment securities and money market assets held by the 41 Table of Contents Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and money market assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. Core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the Company and are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by MT Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Average core deposits were $25.8 billion in 2003 and $17.6 billion in 2002 and 2001. Core deposits assumed in connection with the Allfirst acquisition totaled approximately $10.7 billion on April 1, 2003. Due to the low interest rate environment, the Company experienced a significant shift in the composition of core deposits throughout the past three years. Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average core savings and noninterest bearing deposits rose during that period, while average time deposits under $100,000 decreased, exclusive of the impact of core deposits obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average core deposits of MT Bank, N.A. were $267 million in 2003, $342 million in 2002 and $521 million in 2001. Funding provided by core deposits represented 65% of average earning assets in 2003, compared with 61% in 2002 and 63% in 2001. Table 9 summarizes average core deposits in 2003 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.2 billion in 2003 and 2002, compared with $2.0 billion in 2001. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $1.4 billion in 2003, compared with $569 million and $327 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Brokered time deposits averaged $643 million in 2003, $1.9 billion in 2002 and $794 million in 2001, and totaled $827 million at December 31, 2003. The weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits at December 31, 2003 was 19 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $110 million of brokered time deposits. Beginning in 2002, the Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts, which averaged $70 million in 2003 and $59 million in 2002. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Pittsburgh and Atlanta (together, the FHLB), and others as sources of funding. Short term borrowings averaged $4.3 billion in 2003, $3.1 billion in 2002 and $3.3 billion in 2001. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short term borrowings averaged $439 million in 2003, $904 million in 2002 and $814 million in 2001. Also included in short term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to MT Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of MT Bank formed in November 2002. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about MT Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The remaining short term borrowings were predominately comprised of unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily. 42 Table of Contents The average balance of long term borrowings was $6.0 billion in 2003, $4.2 billion in 2002 and $3.5 billion in 2001. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $3.9 billion in 2003, $3.0 billion in 2002 and $2.4 billion in 2001, and subordinated capital notes of $1.2 billion in 2003, $668 million in 2002 and $674 million in 2001. As previously noted, in anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, MT Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. Trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated debentures of MT included in average long term borrowings totaled $595 million in 2003, compared with $318 million in 2002 and 2001. Subordinated capital notes and trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated debentures obtained in the Allfirst acquisition on April 1, 2003 averaged $252 million and $277 million, respectively, in 2003. As described in notes 9 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2003 the Company applied new accounting provisions promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and removed the trusts that had issued the trust preferred securities from its consolidated balance sheet. That change in financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the Company, no material or substantive impact on the Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003, and no impact on 2003s average balances noted herein. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain interest rate swap agreements have been entered into by the Company as part of its management of interest rate risk relating to long term borrowings. Further information on such interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, was 3.81% in 2003, down from 4.03% in 2002. The yield on earning assets during 2003 was 5.42%, down 100 basis points from 6.42% in 2002, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased 78 basis points to 1.61% from 2.39% in 2002. Lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained in the Allfirst merger contributed to the reduced yields on earning assets in 2003 when compared with 2002 and were the leading cause for the lower year over year net interest spread. The decreases in interest rates earned and paid also reflect generally lower market interest rates in 2003 as compared with 2002, including the impact of reductions by the Federal Reserve of its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate of 50 basis points in November 2002 and 25 basis points in June 2003. The Federal Reserve also took numerous actions throughout 2001 to lower the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by 475 basis points. In general, the full year impact of such actions combined with the 50 basis point reduction in November 2002 contributed to a greater decline in 2002s short term rates on deposits and borrowings as compared with the decline in yields on loans and other earning assets. As a result, the impact of changing interest rates had a positive effect on the Companys net interest spread in 2002 as compared with 2001. The yield on the Companys earning assets decreased 120 basis points in 2002 from 7.62% in 2001, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2002 was down 152 basis points from 3.91%. The impact of the more rapid repricing of interest bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the full year impact of 2001s interest rate reductions led to a 32 basis point increase in the Companys net interest spread, from 3.71% in 2001 to 4.03% in 2002. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Average net interest free funds totaled $6.8 billion in 2003, $4.0 billion in 2002 and $3.7 billion in 2001. The higher level of average net interest free funds in 2003 was due largely to the impact of the Allfirst 43 Table of Contents acquisition, which provided, on average for 2003, noninterest bearing deposits of $2.8 billion and stockholders equity of $1.5 billion, partially offset by goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets of $1.5 billion and bank owned life insurance of $214 million. The increase in average net interest free funds in 2002 as compared with 2001 was largely the result of higher levels of noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $2.7 billion in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2002 and $1.3 billion in 2001. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $858 million in 2003, $604 million in 2002 and $573 million in 2001. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was .28% in 2003, compared with .33% in 2002 and .52% in 2001. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2003 and 2002 compared with 2001 resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution, offset, in part, by higher balances of net interest free funds. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 4.09% in 2003, compared with 4.36% in 2002 and 4.23% in 2001. As noted previously, lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained in the Allfirst acquisition contributed to the lower net interest margin in 2003 as compared with 2002. Nevertheless, the net interest margin declined in each quarter of 2003. As a result, the net interest margin of 3.96% in 2003s fourth quarter was the lowest quarterly net interest margin earned by the Company since the first quarter of 2000. The Companys net interest income and net interest margin could be adversely impacted by future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or, as appropriate, the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 2003 was $685 million. In general, under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates. As of December 31, 2003, all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated fair values of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $1 million at December 31, 2003, compared with a gain of $8 million at December 31, 2002. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The estimated fair value of the 44 Table of Contents interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately $1 million at December 31, 2002. Net of applicable income taxes, such loss was approximately $622 thousand and was included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average rate paid or received on those swaps are presented in table 10. Provision For Credit Losses The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $131 million in 2003, up from $122 million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001. Net loan charge offs were $97 million in 2003, compared with $108 million and $75 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .28% in 2003, compared with .42% in 2002 and .31% in 2001. Net charge offs in 2003 of loans acquired from Allfirst were not significant. A summary of loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 11. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual and restructured loans and aggregated $240 million or .67% of loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2003, compared with $215 million or .84% at December 31, 2002 and $190 million or .76% at December 31, 2001. The increase in the amount of loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 as compared with a year earlier reflects the inclusion of approximately $67 million of such loans obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. The higher level of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2002 compared with December 31, 2001 was largely the result of the inclusion at the 2002 year end of three commercial loans totaling $49 million that were classified as nonperforming during 2002. Outstanding balances relating to those same three loans included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003 totaled $33 million, including a $17 million portion obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst. That $17 million is included in the $67 million of nonperforming loans noted above. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $155 million or .43% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2003, compared with $154 million or .60% at December 31, 2002 and $147 million or .58% at December 31, 2001. Such loans at the recent year end include $17 million of accruing loans past due 90 days or more obtained in the Allfirst transaction. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more also included $118 million, $123 million and $108 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company and repurchased from the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies. The loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with them, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data is presented in table 12. Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Net charge offs of commercial real estate loans in 2003 were $6 million, 45 Table of Contents compared with $7 million in 2002 and $5 million in 2001. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled $48 million at December 31, 2003, compared with $49 million and $39 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Commercial real estate loans obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 were $4 million. Commercial loans and leases charged off during 2003 and 2001, net of recoveries, totaled $32 million, compared with $54 million in 2002. Included in 2002s net charge offs was the entire $17 million outstanding balance of two leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of that year. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled $120 million at December 31, 2003, $102 million a year earlier and $85 million at December 31, 2001. Commercial loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 were $45 million. During 2003 and 2002, net charge offs of residential real estate loans were $5 million, compared with $4 million in 2001. Residential real estate loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 totaled $51 million, compared with $37 million and $35 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $141 million, $142 million and $135 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As already noted, a substantial portion of such amounts relate to loans repurchased from GNMA which are fully guaranteed by government agencies. Residential real estate loans obtained in the Allfirst acquisition classified as nonperforming and past due 90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $13 million and $7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Net charge offs of consumer loans and leases were $54 million in 2003, representing .53% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during the year, compared with $42 million or .62% in 2002 and $34 million or .61% in 2001. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Net indirect automobile loan and lease charge offs during 2003 were $32 million, compared with $21 million and $12 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Consumer loans and leases classified as nonperforming totaled $21 million or .19% of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2003, compared with $27 million or .37% at December 31, 2002 and $31 million or .51% at December 31, 2001. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and $5 million at December 31, 2001. Consumer loans and leases obtained in the Allfirst transaction classified as nonperforming and past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $5 million and $1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic 46 Table of Contents growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; (iii) significant growth in loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types; and (iv) the large portfolios of loans obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst which management continues to evaluate in accordance with the Companys policies and procedures for credit underwriting, loan classification, and measurement of exposure to loss. The level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2003 in light of (i) the uncertain status of the overall economic recovery; (ii) the mixed economic indicators being proffered by government economists and others; and (iii) given the relative size of the acquired Allfirst loan portfolios, the status of managements ongoing detailed credit reviews of such portfolios. Although there are signs that the national economy has improved and optimism about its future outlook is growing, concerns exist about stagnant job growth, which could cause consumer spending to slow; higher interest rates, which could adversely impact the housing market; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and sluggish commercial loan demand. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following paragraphs describe these components. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all commercial and commercial real estate loans which are in nonaccrual status. Specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans greater than $250,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimum delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes a loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Items considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other factors; levels of and 47 Table of Contents trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national and local economic conditions and trends; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically New York State and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions; (iv) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; (v) additional risk associated with growth in the Companys portfolio of consumer loans in recent years, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans; (vi) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance; and (vii) additional uncertainty resulting from acquired loan portfolios to be fully analyzed by the Companys loan review department in order to become familiar with the underlying characteristics of the portfolios and specific borrowers. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 further dampened the economic outlook for the United States, which in 2001 and 2002 experienced its first significant downturn in many years. The economies of New York State, and New York City in particular, were specifically damaged by the events of September 11, 2001. Economic performance of the most significant market regions served by the Company during 2003 was mixed. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market approximated the national average (which was a slight decline from 2002). The manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse continued to experience weakness, including announced corporate layoffs in those areas. In the Hudson Valley region of New York State, private sector job growth was more than one full percentage point higher than the national average (1.4% compared with job loss of .2% nationally). Also better than the national average for private sector job growth were the Maryland, northern Virginia and southeastern Pennsylvania regions, whereas the Binghamton, New York and eastern Pennsylvania regions, largely manufacturing oriented, lagged the national average. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness, lack of population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions and other factors, continue to indicate an environment of economic uncertainty, both in the markets the Company serves and for the national economy. 48 Table of Contents Table 13 presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $164 million at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans was $26 million and $18 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .29% and .19% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the unallocated allowance as a percentage of loans from the 2002 year end to December 31, 2003 reflects the factors already described, including prolonged uncertainty about regional and national economic conditions and the status of managements ongoing credit reviews of the loans obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst. As already noted, management continues to evaluate the loan portfolios obtained in the Allfirst transaction in accordance with the Companys credit policies and procedures. The slight decrease in the unallocated portion of the allowance from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 reflects the modest impact of improving economic conditions near 2002s year end. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2003 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $614 million or 1.72% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2003, compared with $436 million or 1.70% at December 31, 2002 and $425 million or 1.69% at December 31, 2001. On the April 1, 2003 acquisition date, Allfirst had an allowance for credit losses of $146 million, or 1.43% of Allfirsts loans then outstanding. Immediately following the acquisition, the combined balance sheet of MT and Allfirst included an allowance for credit losses of $591 million, or 1.62% of the $36.5 billion of then outstanding loans. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 256%, 203% and 223%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2003. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2003. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $218 million at December 31, 2003, or .6% of total loans and leases, of which $216 million were obtained in the Allfirst transaction. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $20 million at December 31, 2003, compared with $17 million a year earlier and $16 million at the end of 2001. Other Income Other income grew 62% to $831 million in 2003 from $512 million in 2002. Approximately $279 million of the increase was attributable to revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the improvement. Other income in 2002 was 7% higher than the $477 million earned in 2001. Growth in revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services significantly contributed to that increase. 49 Table of Contents Mortgage banking revenues were $149 million in 2003, $116 million in 2002 and $103 million in 2001. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities are largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program, which, as noted earlier, were operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction. Residential mortgage banking revenues, which are comprised of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, rose 11% to $129 million in 2003 from $116 million in 2002. Mortgage banking revenues in 2002 were 13% higher than $103 million in 2001. The higher revenues in 2002 and 2003 were due to the impact of historically low levels of interest rates that produced a favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $5.9 billion in 2003, compared with $5.7 billion and $5.0 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and unrealized gains from recording residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans at fair market value aggregated $65 million in 2003, $54 million in 2002 and $50 million in 2001. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $54 million in 2003, up from $53 million in 2002 and $44 million in 2001. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $5 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $13.6 billion at December 31, 2003, $12.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2001, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $1.0 billion, $586 million and $222 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $129 million at December 31, 2003, $103 million a year earlier and $107 million at December 31, 2001. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were $8 million at December 31, 2003, $6 million a year earlier and $2 million at December 31, 2001 of purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre determined rates were $824 million and $459 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003, $1.5 billion and $825 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 billion and $714 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Net unrealized gains on residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $7 million, $15 million and $8 million at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Increases in such net unrealized gains in 2002 and 2001 added $7 million and $8 million, respectively, to mortgage banking revenues, while an $8 million decline in net unrealized gains reduced mortgage banking revenues in 2003. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $20 million in 2003, including $13 million of revenues from loan origination and sales activities and $7 million of mortgage loan servicing revenues. Commercial mortgage banking revenues in 2003 were predominantly related to the business obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Capitalized commercial mortgage servicing assets totaled $22 million at December 31, 2003. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $3.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and included $825 million of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. At December 31, 2003, commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans were $72 million, commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $71 million and commercial mortgage loans held for sale were $1 million. 50 Table of Contents Service charges on deposit accounts rose 85% to $310 million in 2003 from $168 million in 2002. Fees for deposit services provided to customers in areas formerly served by Allfirst contributed $127 million to such revenue in 2003. The remaining increase was largely attributable to increased fees for check processing services on retail customer transaction accounts. Service charges in 2002 were up 16% from $144 million in 2001. Higher transactional deposit account balances, which generate higher levels of service charges than non transactional accounts, contributed to the higher service charge income levels in 2002. Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income rose 91% to $115 million in 2003 from $60 million in 2002, and included $55 million of revenues associated with the operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction. During 2003, increases in market values of equity securities were offset by lower managed balances of proprietary mutual funds. Reflecting general declines in market values of equity securities, trust income declined 7% in 2002 from $64 million in 2001. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, were $134.5 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with $42.8 billion at December 31, 2002. Trust assets under management totaled $24.4 billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $51 million in 2003, an increase of 18% from $43 million in 2002. The improvement was the result of revenues from the former Allfirst regions. Higher revenues from sales of annuity products contributed to a 10% increase in brokerage services income in 2002 from $39 million in 2001. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $16 million in 2003, $3 million in 2002 and $4 million in 2001. The increased gains in 2003 as compared with the prior years were due in part to higher volumes of trading assets and liabilities in 2003 and reflect fees and market value changes relating to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed with customers formerly associated with Allfirst. Offsetting trading positions are entered into by the Company to minimize the risks involved with these transactions. Also contributing to the rise in such gains in 2003 were market value increases of $6 million in trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in deferred compensation related liabilities is included in other costs of operations. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $39 million and $12 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company sold bank investment securities resulting in gains of $2 million in 2003 and 2001, compared with losses of $608 thousand in 2002. Other revenues from operations were $188 million in 2003, up from $122 million in 2002 and $120 million in 2001. Included in the 2003 total was approximately $58 million of revenues related to operations acquired from Allfirst. Also contributing to the year over year increase were higher revenues from merchant discount and credit card activities and letter of credit and other credit related fees. The previously described $5 million gain on the sale of the 12% portion of the residential real estate loans that were securitized in November 2002 offset, in part, by lower benefits income from bank owned life insurance, contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations from 2001 to 2002. Other revenues from operations included $45 million ($12 million Allfirst related), $33 million and $35 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance, which includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees totaled $26 million in 2003 ($7 million Allfirst related), and $13 million in 2002 and 2001. Letter of credit and other credit related fees were $54 million ($24 million Allfirst related), $26 million and $24 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Insurance related sales commissions and other revenues totaled 51 Table of Contents $18 million in 2003, compared with $15 million and $13 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. ATM usage fees aggregated $19 million ($6 million Allfirst related) in 2003, compared with $12 million in 2002 and $11 million in 2001. Other Expense Other expense totaled $1.45 billion in 2003, 51% higher than $962 million in 2002 and up 48% from $981 million in 2001. Included in the amounts noted above are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $78 million, $51 million and $60 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively; amortization of goodwill of $62 million in 2001; and merger related expenses of $60 million and $8 million in 2003 and 2001, respectively. There were no merger related expenses in 2002. Exclusive of those nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.31 billion in 2003, up 44% from $910 million in 2002. The April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst was the predominant factor contributing to the higher expense level in 2003. However, since the acquired operations of Allfirst were integrated with the operations the Company previously had throughout the last nine months of 2003, the Companys higher operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to the acquired operations of Allfirst or to the Company as it existed prior to the transaction. Partially offsetting those higher expenses was a $30 million decline in charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Such impairment charges were $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. Noninterest operating expenses in 2002 were 7% higher than $851 million in 2001. The $32 million provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and higher costs for salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation, largely contributed to the higher level of noninterest operating expenses in 2002 as compared with the preceding year. There was no provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights in 2001. Table 3 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense and a summary of merger related expenses. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $740 million in 2003, an increase of 49% from $497 million in 2002. As already discussed, the Company began recognizing expense for stock based compensation effective January 1, 2003. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2003 included $43 million of stock based compensation. Using the retroactive restatement method prescribed by SFAS No. 148, salaries and employee benefits expense for 2002 and 2001 were restated to include $41 million and $32 million, respectively, of stock based compensation. Expenses related to the acquired operations of Allfirst were the leading contributors to the rise in salaries and employee benefits from 2002 to 2003. Also contributing to the higher expense level in 2003 were higher pension costs. Salaries and employee benefits expense in 2002 was 6% higher than $467 million in 2001. That higher level of expense was largely the result of merit salary increases, higher commissions and incentive compensation costs, the $9 million increase in stock based compensation referred to earlier, and higher pension costs. Pension benefit expense was $24 million in 2003, $6 million in 2002, and $2 million in 2001. Approximately $10 million of 2003s expense was directly attributable to former Allfirst employees working for the Company. Investment returns on assets held by the Companys qualified pension plans improved significantly in 2003 reflecting the overall improvement in the equity markets. However, largely as a result of a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate used to value pension plan obligations from 6.75% at December 31, 2002 to 6.25% at December 31, 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation of certain of the Companys pension plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $46 million at December 31, 2003. The lower discount rate resulted from declines in market rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company estimates that as of December 31, 2003, accumulated benefit obligations would increase by approximately $19 million for an incremental 25 basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate. According to the provisions of SFAS 52 Table of Contents No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company was required to have a recorded pension liability that was at least equal to the $46 million noted above. As a result, as of December 31, 2003 the Company increased its previously recorded pension liability by $20 million with a corresponding reduction of other comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $12 million. The Company did not make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2003. In 2002, as a result of poor investment performance, the Company contributed $19 million to its qualified pension plans during that years fourth quarter. That was the first pension plan contribution made by the Company since 1995. As a result of such contribution, there was no excess of accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of assets held by the Companys qualified pension plans as of December 31, 2002. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Pension expense for 2004 is estimated to be approximately $35 million. The number of full time equivalent employees was 13,305 at December 31, 2003, compared with 8,726 and 8,803 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Excluding the nonoperating expense items previously noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $578 million in 2003, 40% higher than $413 million in 2002. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $384 million in 2001. The impact of the Allfirst acquisition was the most significant contributor to the higher nonpersonnel operating expense level in 2003 as compared with 2002. Higher expenses for amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and professional services also contributed to the increased expenses in 2003. Partially offsetting the higher expenses were lower charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. The impairment charges resulted from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflect the impact of changing interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage prepayments. The most significant factor contributing to the rise in nonpersonnel operating expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001 was the aforementioned $32 million provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. There was no such provision during the year ended December 31, 2001. Higher amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights also contributed to the higher expense levels in 2002 as compared with 2001. Such amortization charges were $48 million in 2003, $40 million in 2002, and $32 million in 2001. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $277 million in 2003, compared with $219 million in 2002 and $199 million in 2001. The effective tax rates were 32.5% in 2003, 32.4% in 2002 and 36.0% in 2001. The lower tax rates in 2003 and 2002 as compared with 2001 were the result of the Company ceasing to amortize non deductible goodwill in connection with the implementation of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets was $229 million at December 31, 2003 and $6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in such assets included $216 million of loans to foreign borrowers associated with business activities obtained in the acquisition of Allfirst. Offshore deposits totaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. 53 Table of Contents Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers, which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 65% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2003, compared with 60% and 62% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLB and others. MT Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $6.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $3.1 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. MT Bank and MT Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2003 totaling approximately $2.2 billion. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2003 or 2002. As previously noted, in anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, MT Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to provide liquidity to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $559 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of MT Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from MT Bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the Company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings aggregated $3.5 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources 54 Table of Contents and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of MT and MT Bank is presented in table 14. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services. The Company serves in the capacity of remarketing agent for variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs), in a line of business obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. The VRDBs are enhanced by a direct pay letter of credit provided by MT Bank. Holders of the VRDBs generally have the right to sell the bonds to the remarketing agent with seven days notice, which could result in MT Bank owning the VRDBs for some period of time until such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $22 million at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by an MT Bank letter of credit was $1.3 billion. The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. As of December 31, 2003, the contractual amounts and timing of those payments are summarized in table 15. The Company also has off balance sheet commitments to customers that may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Since many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2003 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments. MTs primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to MT are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2003 approximately $696 million was available for payment of dividends to MT from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. MT also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2002. On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either MT or its subsidiary banks. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the Company to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability 55 Table of Contents of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and non parallel shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2003, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $685 million. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Companys Asset Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for risk management purposes. Table 19 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. Many assumptions were utilized by the Company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period, including incremental 100 and 200 basis point rate changes. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, and interest rate differentials (spreads) between and within maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, table 20 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest 56 Table of Contents rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. The Company has historically engaged in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the Asset Liability Committee. However, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities. The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $5.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2002. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $548 million and $290 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. However, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $215 million and $139 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $52 million and $36 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002. The higher amounts of trading account assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 reflect the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed with customers associated with Allfirst and the related offsetting trading positions. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $39 million and $12 million, respectively, relating to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $49 million and $23 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2003 was $5.7 billion or 11.47% of total assets, compared with $3.2 billion or 9.66% at December 31, 2002 and $3.0 billion or 9.40% at December 31, 2001. On a per share basis, stockholders equity increased 37% to $47.55 at the 2003 year end from $34.82 at December 31, 2002, and was 51% higher than $31.54 at December 31, 2001. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $21.97 at December 57 Table of Contents 31, 2003, compared with $22.04 a year earlier and $18.54 at December 31, 2001. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented in table 3. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.89%, 9.48% and 9.65% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. To complete the acquisition of Allfirst on April 1, 2003, MT issued 26,700,000 shares of common stock to AIB resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $2.0 billion. The value ascribed to the common shares issued to AIB was based on the market value of MT common stock at the time the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by MT and AIB. MT also issued shares of common stock in 2001 to complete the acquisition of Premier. On February 9, 2001, MT issued 2,440,812 shares of common stock to former holders of Premier common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase 224,734 shares of MT common stock, resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $176 million. Included in stockholders equity was accumulated other comprehensive income which reflects the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges; and minimum pension liability adjustments. Net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities were $38 million, or $.32 per common share, at December 31, 2003, $55 million, or $.60 per common share, at December 31, 2002 and $23 million, or $.25 per common share, at December 31, 2001. Such unrealized gains are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. Net unrealized fair value losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, were $622 thousand and $298 thousand at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, representing less than $.01 per share at those respective dates. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2003. The minimum pension liability adjustment, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $12 million at December 31, 2003, or $.10 per share. There were no such adjustments at December 31, 2002 or 2001. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Cash dividends paid in 2003 on MTs common stock were $135 million, compared with $97 million and $96 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. MT increased its quarterly dividend on common stock in the fourth quarter of 2002 to $.30 per share from $.25 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $1.20 in 2003, up from $1.05 in 2002 and $1.00 in 2001. MT repurchased 3,007,585 shares of its common stock in 2002 and 4,396,303 shares in 2001, at a cost of $240 million and $324 million, respectively. In November 2001, MT announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2002, MT had repurchased a total of 3,632,098 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $78.49 per share. MT discontinued purchases of its common stock during the third quarter of 2002, determining instead that it would use the Companys internal generation of capital to support the acquisition of Allfirst. There were no common stock repurchases in 2003. However, MT resumed purchases of its common stock in January 2004, and completed the 5,000,000 share repurchase plan in February 2004. The common stock was purchased pursuant to such plans at an average cost of $82.11 per share. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank 58 Table of Contents regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. Core capital includes the $686 million carrying value of trust preferred securities as described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2003, total capital further included $1.2 billion of subordinated notes. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after tax effect of merger related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 23.35% in 2003, 19.78% in 2002 and 19.43% in 2001. Fourth Quarter Results The Companys net income totaled $167 million during the final quarter of 2003, 41% higher than $119 million in the corresponding quarter of 2002. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.35 and $1.39, respectively, in 2003s fourth quarter, compared with $1.25 and $1.29, respectively, in the year earlier quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets, net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was 1.35%, compared with 1.42% in 2002s final quarter. The annualized rate of return on average common stockholders equity for the last three months of 2003 was 11.77%, compared with 15.00% in the similar 2002 period. Net operating income in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 44% to $182 million from $126 million in the last quarter of 2002. Diluted net operating earnings per share rose 11% to $1.47 in the recently completed quarter from $1.32 in the year earlier quarter. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.57% and 28.33%, respectively, in 2003s final quarter, compared with 1.56% and 25.54%, respectively, in the similar 2002 quarter. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $13 million ($.11 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $7 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the corresponding quarter of 2002. Merger related expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $2 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.01 per diluted share. There were no significant merger related expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2002. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2003 and 2002 are provided in table 22. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased to $426 million in the recent quarter, 31% higher than $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. A 42% increase in average earning assets offset, in part, by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, resulted in the improvement. Reflecting the impact of the Allfirst acquisition, average earning assets were $42.7 billion in 2003s fourth quarter, up from $30.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002. Average loans and leases for the recently completed three month period totaled $36.4 billion, an increase of 41% from $25.9 billion during the year earlier quarter. Average loan balances in 2003 and 2002 reflect fourth quarter transactions in each year in which MT converted residential real estate loans of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, into mortgage backed securities. Those transactions are described in Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The yield on earning assets was 5.16% in the last three months of 2003, down 92 basis points from 6.08% in the corresponding 2002 period. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 1.48% in the fourth quarter of 2003, down 61 basis points from 2.09% in the like period of 2002. The resulting net interest spread was 3.68% in 2003s final quarter, compared with 3.99% in the year earlier period. As a result, the Companys net interest margin declined to 3.96% in the fourth quarter of 2003 from 4.28% in the similar quarter of 2002. The decreases in net interest spread and margin were 59 Table of Contents due largely to the impact of yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. The provision for credit losses was $28 million in the final quarter of 2003, compared with $33 million in the corresponding 2002 period. Net charge offs totaled $32 million in the recent quarter, compared with $31 million in 2002s final quarter. Net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were .35% in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with .48% in the year earlier period. Other income rose 69% to $234 million in the final quarter of 2003 from $138 million in 2002s fourth quarter. The increase was attributable to revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 aggregated $378 million, 51% higher than $251 million in the year earlier period. Included in such amounts are expenses considered nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $21 million and $12 million in the final quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively, and merger related expenses of $3 million in 2003s fourth quarter. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $354 million in the recent quarter, 48% above the $239 million recorded in 2002s fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses was largely attributable to operations formerly related to Allfirst, partially offset by lower charges for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2003 reflect a $4 million reduction in total expenses resulting from a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, while a $13 million increase in the valuation allowance in 2002s fourth quarter added to total expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002, the Companys efficiency ratio was 53.9% and 51.7%, respectively. The higher ratio in the recently completed quarter reflects the impact of the acquired Allfirst operations. Table 22 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2003 and 2002. Segment Information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets the Company serves. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. Net income contributed by the Commercial Banking segment totaled $175 60 Table of Contents million in 2003, up 95% from $90 million in 2002. The favorable performance from the prior year was predominately the result of the Allfirst acquisition, which contributed to increases in net interest income on loans of $52 million, service charges on deposit accounts of $36 million and credit related fees of $18 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $37 million. The improvement was also aided by a decline in net charge offs from 2002, largely the result of a $17 million loss in 2002 related to two commercial leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy. Net charge offs for the commercial banking segment were $23 million in 2003 and $48 million in 2002. Net income for this segment totaled $107 million in 2001. The decline in net income in 2002 as compared with 2001 was attributable to the $17 million charge off described above and a $14 million decrease in net interest income, due to a 25 basis point narrowing of the segments net interest margin. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $4 million increase in deposit service charges. Net charge offs in 2001 for the commercial banking segment were $28 million. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program. The Commercial Real Estate segments net income was $119 million in 2003, up 29% from $92 million in 2002. The increase was due to higher net interest income of $38 million, largely the result of average loan balances acquired in the Allfirst transaction and a higher net interest margin on loans in the non Allfirst regions, and commercial mortgage banking revenues of $20 million resulting largely from the Allfirst acquisition. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were higher salaries and benefits and other operating expenses that also resulted from the Allfirst acquisition. Net income in 2002 for the Commercial Real Estate segment was 7% higher than the $87 million earned in 2001. That increase was due largely to an $11 million increase in net interest income, the result of a 12 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans and a 5% increase in average loan balances outstanding. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $86 million in 2003, 34% higher than $64 million in 2002, primarily the result of higher net interest income from investment securities, including securities acquired in the Allfirst transaction. In 2001, this segments net income was $53 million. The 20% increase in net income from 2001 to 2002 was predominantly due to an $18 million increase in net interest income, largely the result of a 34 basis point rise in the net interest margin on investment securities. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of MT. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states in the western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment earned $66 million in 2003, up 75% from the $38 million earned in 2002. The 2003 results include a $34 million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities, including gains from sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment, and a $12 million increase in net interest income, due largely to higher average 61 Table of Contents balances of outstanding loans and deposits. Gains from sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $22 million and $9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also contributing to the segments improved net income was a decrease in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights, which was $30 million lower than in 2002. Partially offsetting the revenue increases noted above were higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of $29 million, exclusive of the impact of changes in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights already noted. The segments net income in 2002 was 12% lower than 2001s total of $43 million. That decrease from 2001 was attributable to a $29 million increase in the provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights and a $19 million increase in salaries, commissions and other operating expenses. Mitigating the impact of those higher expenses was a $27 million increase in net interest income, the result of a higher loan net interest margin and higher average loan balances outstanding; increased loan servicing revenues of $7 million, largely the result of purchased servicing rights; and a $6 million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities. During 2001, gains from sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $10 million. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels which include traditional and in store banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through MT Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. Net income for the Retail Banking segment totaled $192 million in 2003, up 20% from $159 million in 2002. The favorable variance was largely the result of higher net interest income of $180 million and service charges on deposit accounts of $99 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $231 million, all largely attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Allfirst. In the non Allfirst regions, a $62 million decrease in net interest income attributable to deposits, due to a 44 basis point decline in net interest margin, was partially offset by a $49 million increase in net interest income on loans, resulting from increases in indirect automobile loan and home equity line of credit balances outstanding of 51% and 27%, respectively. Earnings for this segment declined 19% in 2002 from $198 million in 2001. A $44 million reduction in net interest income was a significant contributor to such decline. A lower deposit net interest margin of 42 basis points, largely attributable to the impact of the years low interest rate environment, and a 6% decrease in retail deposit balances led to an $82 million decline in net interest income. Partially offsetting this decline was higher loan net interest income of $38 million, primarily the result of a 14% increase in average loan balances outstanding. Also contributing to the lower earnings in 2002 was a $15 million increase in the provision for credit losses and increased operating expenses of $23 million, offset, in part, by an $18 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts. The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the MT Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of goodwill (in 2001) and core deposit and other intangible assets, merger related expenses resulting from acquisitions, and the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. The various components comprising the All Other category resulted in net losses of $64 million in 2003 and $134 million in 2001, and net income of $14 million in 2002. The net loss in 62 Table of Contents 2003 was largely the result of merger related costs, core deposit intangible amortization, and, largely as a result of the Allfirst acquisition, higher operating expenses that under the Companys cost allocation methodologies were not allocated to the Companys reportable segments. Also contributing to the net loss were higher provisions for credit losses. The improvement in 2002 from 2001 was due to the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing, combined with the cessation of amortization of goodwill resulting from the January 1, 2002 adoption of SFAS No. 142. Recent Accounting Developments FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, was issued in November 2002. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 45 as required, and such adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The FASBs stated intent in issuing FIN 46 was to clarify the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity (as defined in FIN 46) if that enterprise has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected returns if they occur, or both. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised FIN 46 (FIN 46R) which attempts to clarify the guidance in the original interpretation. FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. FIN 46 also applies to all variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003 that are considered to be special purpose entities (as defined in FIN 46R) as of December 31, 2003. FIN 46R must be applied to all variable interest entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. As described in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements, implementation of the new accounting provisions related to investments in variable interest entities resulted in the removal of trusts that had issued trust preferred securities from the Companys consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003. Accordingly, at December 31, 2003, the Company included the junior subordinated debentures payable to such trusts as long term borrowings in its consolidated balance sheet. Prior to that date, the Company included the capital securities of the trusts in its consolidated balance sheet as long term borrowings, with accumulated distributions on such securities included in interest expense. That change in financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the Company, had no material or substantive impact on the Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003, had no impact on 2003s average balances noted herein, and resulted in the Company recognizing $30 million in other assets for its investment in the common securities of the trusts that had issued the trust preferred securities that will be concomitantly repaid to MT by the respective trusts from the proceeds of MTs repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. 63 Table of Contents In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and is effective for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. Provisions of SFAS No. 149 that relate to SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that had been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003 should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective dates. All provisions of SFAS No. 149 should be applied prospectively, except for paragraphs 7(a) and 23(a), which relate to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist, which should be applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30, 2003. The provisions of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities. It is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption. Restatement is not permitted. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In October 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, (SFAS No. 132R), an amendment of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and a revision of SFAS No. 132. SFAS No. 132R revised employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It did not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS Nos. 87, 88 and 106. While retaining the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132, which it replaced, SFAS No. 132R requires additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The provisions of SFAS No. 132R are generally effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The interim period disclosures required by this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. The disclosures for earlier periods should be restated, or if it is not practicable to obtain this information, the notes to the financial statements should include all available information and identify information that is not available. The Company has complied with the required provisions of SFAS No. 132R and included the appropriate information in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Forward Looking Statements This Financial Review and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements. 64 Table of Contents Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; credit losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock options to be issued in future periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and or MT and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi year contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Companys future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger and acquisition activities compared to the Companys expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other Future Factors. 65 Table of Contents MT BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 7, Table 1 ALLFIRST FINANCIAL, INC.
