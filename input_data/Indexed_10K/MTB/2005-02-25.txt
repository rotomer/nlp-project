Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $52.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.). M&T Bank, with total assets of $52.4 billion at December 31, 2004, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 662 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and 28 institutional clients; M&T Lease, LLC, a consumer leasing company; and Matthews, Bartlett & Dedecker, Inc., an insurance agency. M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $367 million at December 31, 2004, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. Insurance products were offered by M&T Bank, N.A. through banking offices of M&T Bank until August 1, 2004, when that business was transferred to M&T Securities. On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. (Allfirst), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, from Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB), Dublin, Ireland. Allfirst Bank, Allfirsts primary bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Allfirst Bank operated 269 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia at the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Allfirst represented a major geographic expansion by M&T and created a strong Mid Atlantic banking franchise. AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding Allfirst common shares. Immediately after the completion of the acquisition, AIB owned approximately 22.5% of the outstanding shares of M&Ts common stock. The results of operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since April 1, 2003. Table 1 provides a summary of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company on April 1, 2003 in connection with the Allfirst transaction. Table 1 ALLFIRST FINANCIAL INC. ACQUISITION (In thousands) Assets Investment securities $ 1,312,301 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 10,265,123 Allowance for credit losses (146,300 ) Loans and leases, net 10,118,823 Goodwill 1,806,528 Core deposit and other intangible assets 199,265 Other assets 3,053,742 Total assets $ 16,490,659 Liabilities Deposits $ 10,935,521 Short term borrowings 1,610,782 Long term borrowings 1,226,518 Other liabilities 723,882 Total liabilities $ 14,496,703 Merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $60 million ($39 million after tax effect). Such expenses were for professional services and temporary help associated with the conversion of systems and or integration of operations; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to Allfirsts customers; travel and relocation costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. There were no similar merger related expenses incurred during 2004. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the 29 Allfirst merger were charges totaling $29 million, net of applicable income taxes ($48 million before tax effect), for severance costs for former Allfirst employees; investment banking and other professional fees; and termination of Allfirst contracts for various services. As of December 31, 2004, there were no significant amounts of unpaid merger related expenses or charges included in the determination of goodwill. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the 30 Companys results of operations. Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held in trusts or other so called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview Net income for the Company in 2004 was $723 million or $6.00 of diluted earnings per common share, representing increases of 26% and 21%, respectively, from $574 million or $4.95 per diluted share in 2003. Basic earnings per common share rose 21% to $6.14 in 2004 from $5.08 in 2003. The after tax impact of merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition was $39 million ($60 million pre tax) or $.34 of diluted earnings per share and $.35 of basic earnings per share in 2003. There were no similar expenses in either 2004 or 2002. Net income in 2002 was $457 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $4.78 and $4.94, respectively. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2004 was 1.40%, compared with 1.27% in 2003 and 1.43% in 2002. The return on average common stockholders equity was 12.67% in 2004, 11.62% in 2003 and 15.09% in 2002. Excluding the impact of merger related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity were 1.35% and 12.41%, respectively, in 2003. Net interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis rose 8% to $1.75 billion in 2004 from $1.62 billion in 2003, largely due to higher average earning assets, which increased 14% to $45.2 billion in 2004 from $39.5 billion in 2003. The increase in average earning assets resulted from higher levels of loans, leases and investment securities. Average loans and leases increased 9% to $37.1 billion in 2004 from $34.0 billion in 2003, largely due to the full year impact of loans obtained in the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst. Average balances of investment securities rose to $8.0 billion in 2004 from $5.3 billion in 2003. Partially offsetting the impact of growth in earning assets was a lower net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Net interest margin declined 21 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.88% in 2004 from 4.09% in 2003, due largely to lower yields earned on loans and investment securities. Also as a result of higher average earning assets, taxable equivalent net interest income in 2003 was 28% higher than $1.26 billion in 2002. Average earning assets in 2003 rose 37% from $28.9 billion in 2002, largely the result of loans, leases and investment securities obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2003 increased $8.5 billion, or 33%, from $25.5 billion in 2002. Included in the 2003 average was the nine month impact of the $10.3 billion of loans and leases obtained in the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst. Partially offsetting the impact of higher average earning assets was a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined 27 basis points in 2003 from 4.36% a year earlier, largely resulting from lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities acquired in the Allfirst transaction. Reflecting favorable credit quality, the provision for credit losses was $95 million in 2004, down from $131 million in 2003 and $122 million in 2002. Net charge offs decreased to $82 million in 2004 from $97 million in 2003 and $108 million in 2002. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding declined to .22% in 2004 from .28% in 2003 and .42% in 2002. Net charge offs of loans acquired from Allfirst were not significant during 2004 or 2003. The provision in each year reflects the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans. Noninterest income grew 13% to $943 million in 2004 from $831 million in 2003. Noninterest income was $512 million in 2002. The increase in such income in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to 31 operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related income in 2004 compared with nine months of similar income in 2003. Excluding Allfirst related revenues, higher levels of service charges on deposit accounts, letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related income were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues resulting from a lower level of loan originations in 2004. Approximately $279 million of the increase from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the improvement. Noninterest expense in 2004 aggregated $1.52 billion, up 5% from $1.45 billion in 2003. Noninterest expense was $962 million in 2002. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $75 million, $78 million and $51 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and merger related expenses of $60 million in 2003. As already noted, there were no merger related expenses in 2004 or 2002. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.44 billion in 2004, compared with $1.31 billion in 2003 and $910 million in 2002. A significant portion of the increase in such expenses in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related expenses in 2004 compared with nine months of similar expenses in 2003. Also contributing to the higher expenses in 2004 was a $25 million cash contribution made by M&T Bank to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt, private charitable foundation, during 2004s third quarter. Expenses related to operations formerly associated with Allfirst significantly contributed to the higher level of expenses in 2003 compared with 2002, along with increased expenses for salaries and benefits, professional services and amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting those higher expenses was a $30 million decrease in the provision for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which was $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. A partial reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $4 million was recognized in 2004. The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment securities), was 53.5% in 2004, compared with 53.6% in 2003 and 51.3% in 2002. The higher ratios in 2004 and 2003 as compared with 2002 reflect the impact of the acquired Allfirst operations that are now part of M&T. 32 Table 2 EARNINGS SUMMARY Dollars in millions Increase (Decrease)(a) Compound 2003 to 2004 2002 to 2003 Growth Rate 5 Years Amount % Amount % 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 to 2004 $173.2 8 $ 286.8 15 Interest income(b) $ 2,316.1 2,142.9 1,856.1 2,119.4 1,783.3 9 % 36.4 7 (66.7 ) (11 ) Interest expense 564.2 527.8 594.5 943.6 918.6 (5 ) Net interest 136.8 8 353.5 28 income(b) 1,751.9 1,615.1 1,261.6 1,175.8 864.7 18 Less: provision for (36.0 ) (27 ) 9.0 7 credit losses 95.0 131.0 122.0 103.5 38.0 16 .4 3.1 Gain (loss) on sales of bank investment securities 2.9 2.5 (.6 ) 1.9 (3.1 ) 111.5 13 316.1 62 Other income 940.1 828.6 512.5 475.5 327.8 27 Less: 66.2 9 243.3 49 Salaries and employee benefits 806.6 740.3 497.0 467.2 353.4 22 1.6 243.4 52 Other expense 709.5 708.0 464.6 513.4 365.2 19 216.9 25 177.0 26 Income before income taxes 1,083.8 866.9 689.9 569.1 432.8 22 Less: 1.0 6 2.3 16 Taxable equivalent adjustment(b) 17.3 16.3 14.0 17.5 10.5 18 67.3 24 57.6 26 Income taxes 344.0 276.7 219.1 198.5 154.1 18 $148.6 26 $ 117.1 26 Net income $ 722.5 573.9 456.8 353.1 268.2 23 % (a) Changes were calculated from unrounded amounts. (b) Interest income data are on a taxable equivalent basis. The taxable equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 39% for 2004 and 2002, 36% for 2003, 37% for 2001, and 40% for 2000. 33 Supplemental Reporting of Non GAAP Results of Operations M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.1 billion at both December 31, 2004 and 2003, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, up from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002 due to the Allfirst acquisition. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $46 million, $48 million and $32 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The higher levels of such amortization in 2004 and 2003 as compared with 2002 were due to the impact of core deposit and other intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of Allfirst. Since 1998 M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, in which M&T excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Net operating income increased 16% to $769 million in 2004 from $661 million in 2003. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2004 rose 12% to $6.38 from $5.70 in 2003. In 2002, net operating income totaled $489 million and diluted net operating earnings per share were $5.12. A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share is presented in table 3. Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.59% in 2004 and 2002, compared with 1.55% in 2003. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 28.76% in 2004, compared with 28.49% and 26.71% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Including the effect of merger related expenses, net operating return on average tangible assets for 2003 was 1.46% and net operating return on average tangible common equity was 26.80%. A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity is presented in table 3. 34 Table 3 RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON GAAP MEASURES 2004 2003 2002 Income statement data In thousands, except per share Net income Net income $ 722,521 $ 573,942 $ 456,752 Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets(a) 46,097 47,826 32,491 Merger related expenses(a) 39,163 Net operating income $ 768,618 $ 660,931 $ 489,243 Earnings per share Diluted earnings per common share $ 6.00 $ 4.95 $ 4.78 Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets(a) .38 .41 .34 Merger related expenses(a) .34 Diluted net operating earnings per share $ 6.38 $ 5.70 $ 5.12 Other expense Other expense $ 1,516,018 $ 1,448,180 $ 961,611 Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (75,410 ) (78,152 ) (51,484 ) Merger related expenses (60,387 ) Noninterest operating expense $ 1,440,608 $ 1,309,641 $ 910,127 Merger related expenses Salaries and employee benefits $ $ 8,542 $ Equipment and net occupancy 2,126 Printing, postage and supplies 3,216 Other costs of operations 46,503 Total $ $ 60,387 $ Balance sheet data In millions Average assets Average assets $ 51,517 $ 45,349 $ 31,935 Goodwill (2,904 ) (2,456 ) (1,098 ) Core deposit and other intangible assets (201 ) (233 ) (143 ) Deferred taxes 46 Average tangible assets $ 48,412 $ 42,660 $ 30,740 Average equity Average equity $ 5,701 $ 4,941 $ 3,026 Goodwill (2,904 ) (2,456 ) (1,098 ) Core deposit and other intangible assets (201 ) (233 ) (143 ) Deferred taxes 76 68 46 Average tangible equity $ 2,672 $ 2,320 $ 1,831 At end of year Total assets Total assets $ 52,939 $ 49,826 $ 33,201 Goodwill (2,904 ) (2,904 ) (1,098 ) Core deposit and other intangible assets (166 ) (241 ) (119 ) Deferred taxes 40 Total tangible assets $ 49,869 $ 46,681 $ 32,024 Total equity Total equity $ 5,730 $ 5,717 $ 3,208 Goodwill (2,904 ) (2,904 ) (1,098 ) Core deposit and other intangible assets (166 ) (241 ) (119 ) Deferred taxes 64 70 40 Total tangible equity $ 2,724 $ 2,642 $ 2,031 (a) After any related tax effect. 35 Net Interest Income/ Lending and Funding Activities Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 8% to $1.75 billion in 2004 from $1.62 billion in 2003, largely the result of growth in average earning assets. Such assets totaled $45.2 billion in 2004, up 14% from $39.5 billion in 2003. Higher average balances of loans and leases outstanding and investment securities contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting the positive impact on taxable equivalent net interest income of higher average earning assets was a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.88% in 2004 from 4.09% in 2003. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2004 grew 9% to $37.1 billion from $34.0 billion in 2003. The 2003 average balance reflected the impact of the $10.3 billion of loans obtained on April 1, 2003 in the Allfirst acquisition for the final nine months of that year, while the 2004 average balance reflected a full year impact of Allfirst related loans. The $10.3 billion of acquired loans were comprised of approximately $4.5 billion of commercial loans and leases (including $314 million of leveraged leases and $230 million of loans to foreign borrowers), $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million of residential real estate loans and $2.9 billion of consumer loans and leases. Other than the residential real estate loan portfolio, all of the Companys other significant loan categories (commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans and leases) experienced growth in 2004 when compared with 2003, after considering the full year impact that the acquired Allfirst loans had on 2004s average loan balances. Average commercial real estate loans were $13.3 billion in 2004, 15% higher than $11.6 billion in 2003. Excluding the impact of the loans in the former Allfirst regions, average balances of outstanding commercial real estate loans grew $936 million in 2004 from 2003. Average consumer loans and leases totaled $11.2 billion during 2004, up 11% from $10.1 billion in the previous year, largely the result of growth in the automobile loan and home equity line of credit portfolios. The full year impact of Allfirst related loans and a $362 million increase in average automobile floor plan loans were the most significant contributors to higher average commercial loans and leases, which totaled $9.5 billion in 2004, up 12% from $8.5 billion in 2003. Average residential real estate loans declined in 2004 due largely to customer repayments of loans and the full year impact of two separate securitization transactions totaling $1.3 billion of such loans during 2003s final quarter. In connection with the first 2003 securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $838 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $112 million in cash and retained approximately 87% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $1 million on the transaction which was included in other revenues from operations. In 2003s second securitization transaction, approximately $441 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans were converted to mortgage backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). All of those mortgage backed securities were retained by the Company and, accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized. In each securitization, the retained securities were added to the Companys portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 28% to $1.62 billion in 2003 from $1.26 billion in 2002. The improvement reflects a 37% increase in average earning assets to $39.5 billion in 2003 from $28.9 billion in 2002, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin which declined to 4.09% in 2003 from 4.36% in 2002. The growth in average earning assets was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $34.0 billion in 2003, up 33% from 2002s average of $25.5 billion. The most significant factor for those higher loan balances was the nine month impact of the $10.3 billion of loans obtained in the Allfirst transaction. Average consumer loans and leases, excluding those obtained in the Allfirst acquisition, grew 20% in 2003, or $1.4 billion, from $6.8 billion in 2002. Increases in the outstanding average balances of automobile loans and leases of $1.0 billion and home equity lines of credit of $495 million were the leading contributors to that growth. Partially offsetting the growth in those loan types was a decline in the residential real estate loan portfolio, due largely to customer repayments of loans and the impact of the two securitization transactions completed in 2003s fourth quarter and the full year impact of a similar $1.1 billion securitization in the fourth quarter of 2002. 36 Table 4 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT RATES 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate (Average balance in millions; interest in thousands) ASSETS Earning assets Loans and leases, net of unearned discount(a) Commercial, financial, etc. $ 9,534 $ 410,258 4.30 % 8,523 358,629 4.21 % 5,146 261,867 5.09 % 5,271 372,234 7.06 % 4,129 365,951 8.86 % Real estate commercial 13,264 763,134 5.75 11,573 706,022 6.10 9,498 661,382 6.96 9,224 732,162 7.94 7,188 615,304 8.56 Real estate consumer 3,111 184,125 5.92 3,777 232,454 6.15 4,087 285,055 6.98 4,354 328,979 7.55 3,266 249,224 7.63 Consumer 11,220 626,255 5.58 10,098 607,909 6.02 6,776 467,167 6.89 5,581 464,151 8.32 3,920 352,331 8.99 Total loans and leases, net 37,129 1,983,772 5.34 33,971 1,905,014 5.61 25,507 1,675,471 6.57 24,430 1,897,526 7.77 18,503 1,582,810 8.55 Money market assets Interest bearing deposits at banks 13 65 .51 14 147 1.03 6 76 1.32 4 116 3.10 6 308 5.41 Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities 8 134 1.60 147 1,875 1.28 272 4,455 1.63 63 2,027 3.22 212 12,891 6.08 Trading account 53 418 .79 55 647 1.18 13 247 1.86 13 413 3.16 21 1,069 5.08 Total money market assets 74 617 .83 216 2,669 1.24 291 4,778 1.64 80 2,556 3.20 239 14,268 5.97 Investment securities(b) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 4,169 158,953 3.81 2,599 106,209 4.09 1,292 81,412 6.30 1,709 113,908 6.67 1,603 105,104 6.56 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 218 15,017 6.90 251 15,827 6.30 279 17,828 6.40 332 24,483 7.37 122 8,890 7.27 Other 3,610 157,703 4.37 2,494 113,159 4.54 1,552 76,659 4.94 1,267 80,925 6.39 1,033 72,259 7.00 Total investment securities 7,997 331,673 4.15 5,344 235,195 4.40 3,123 175,899 5.63 3,308 219,316 6.63 2,758 186,253 6.75 Total earning assets 45,200 2,316,062 5.13 39,531 2,142,878 5.42 28,921 1,856,148 6.42 27,818 2,119,398 7.62 21,500 1,783,331 8.30 Allowance for credit losses (626 ) (574 ) (438 ) (409 ) (333 ) Cash and due from banks 1,599 1,542 732 706 536 Other assets 5,344 4,850 2,720 2,727 1,967 Total assets $ 51,517 45,349 31,935 30,842 23,670 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Interest bearing liabilities Interest bearing deposits NOW accounts $ 550 1,802 .33 1,021 3,613 .35 761 3,900 .51 722 8,548 1.18 486 7,487 1.54 Savings deposits 15,305 92,064 .60 13,278 102,190 .77 8,899 107,281 1.21 7,378 134,454 1.82 5,507 132,225 2.40 Time deposits 6,948 154,722 2.23 6,638 159,700 2.41 7,398 237,001 3.20 8,906 453,940 5.10 7,674 445,666 5.81 Deposits at foreign office 3,136 43,034 1.37 1,445 14,991 1.04 569 8,460 1.49 327 11,264 3.44 250 14,915 5.95 Total interest bearing deposits 25,939 291,622 1.12 22,382 280,494 1.25 17,627 356,642 2.02 17,333 608,206 3.51 13,917 600,293 4.31 Short term borrowings 5,142 71,172 1.38 4,331 49,064 1.13 3,125 52,723 1.69 3,280 124,810 3.81 2,715 172,466 6.35 Long term borrowings 5,832 201,366 3.45 6,018 198,252 3.29 4,162 185,149 4.45 3,538 210,581 5.95 2,086 145,838 6.99 Total interest bearing liabilities 36,913 564,160 1.53 32,731 527,810 1.61 24,914 594,514 2.39 24,151 943,597 3.91 18,718 918,597 4.91 Noninterest bearing deposits 8,039 6,801 3,618 3,327 2,425 Other liabilities 864 876 377 389 482 Total liabilities 45,816 40,408 28,909 27,867 21,625 Stockholders equity 5,701 4,941 3,026 2,975 2,045 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 51,517 45,349 31,935 30,842 23,670 Net interest spread 3.60 3.81 4.03 3.71 3.39 Contribution of interest free funds .28 .28 .33 .52 .63 Net interest income/margin on earning assets $ 1,751,902 3.88 % 1,615,068 4.09 % 1,261,634 4.36 % 1,175,801 4.23 % 864,734 4.02 % (a) Includes nonaccrual loans.

The Company received $140 million in cash and retained approximately 88% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $5 million on the transaction which was included in other revenues from operations. In accordance with GAAP, the qualified special purpose trusts related to the 2003 and 2002 mortgage loan securitization transactions are not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the resulting mortgage backed securities provide enhanced liquidity opportunities to the Company because the securities may be more readily pledged to secure borrowings or sold than the underlying loans could be. Additionally, under present regulatory risk based capital rules, the Company is generally required to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital when directly investing in residential real estate loans than when investing in government guaranteed or highly rated, privately placed mortgage backed securities. Additional information about these transactions and the qualified special purpose trusts is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information about the Companys regulatory capital requirements is included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 5 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2004 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Table 6 presents such commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2004 by geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. As noted earlier, commercial loans and leases obtained in the Allfirst transaction totaled $4.5 billion on April 1, 2003, including $314 million of leveraged leases. Included in the Allfirst loan and lease portfolio were certain business lines in which the Company has not traditionally been active. An international maritime portfolio, which at April 1, 2003 totaled $113 million, was acquired. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, outstanding balances relating to that portfolio totaled $14 million and $71 million, respectively. The Company expects that outstanding balances related to this specialized business will continue to decline. Excluding the maritime loans noted above, international loans totaled $216 million at December 31, 2004 and $147 million at December 31, 2003. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee 38 programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under this program at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $84 million and $123 million, respectively. Commercial leases obtained on April 1, 2003 from Allfirst totaled $610 million, and consisted of general equipment leases with an emphasis on transportation equipment, including railcars, tractors, trailers and commercial aircraft. The Company has decided not to pursue growing the commercial aircraft component of the lease portfolio. The Companys commercial aircraft lease portfolio totaled $82 million and $98 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, including $63 million and $69 million that were obtained from Allfirst. Pursuant to the Allfirst merger agreement, AIB is obligated to indemnify the Company for losses exceeding approximately $4 million on the $63 million of acquired commercial aircraft leases that remained at December 31, 2004. That compares to AIBs obligation to indemnify the Company for losses exceeding approximately $7 million on the $69 million of acquired commercial aircraft leases that remained at December 31, 2003. Of the $10.0 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the 2004 year end, approximately $8.1 billion, or 82%, were secured, while 45%, 26% and 13% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately $14.0 billion of commercial real estate loans, $3.3 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $5.2 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $12.4 billion, $3.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2003. As of April 1, 2003, loans obtained in the Allfirst acquisition that were secured by real estate aggregated $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million of real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $2.3 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit. A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans, which represented approximately 52% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2004. Table 7 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2004. Of the $5.1 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 37% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 38% by retail space and 13% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 44% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $10 million made up approximately 38% of the total. 40 Table 7 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS (net of unearned discount) December 31, 2004 Percent of dollars outstanding by loan size Outstandings $0 1 $1 5 $5 10 $10+ (Dollars in millions) Metropolitan New York City Apartments/ Multifamily $ 1,903 4 % 15 % 6 % 12 % Office 672 1 3 2 7 Retail/ Services 1,923 3 12 7 16 Construction 88 1 1 Industrial 98 1 1 Other 397 1 3 2 2 Total Metropolitan New York City 5,081 9 % 35 % 18 % 38 % Other New York State Apartments/ Multifamily 351 3 % 5 % 1 % 1 % Office 1,000 9 13 6 2 Retail/ Services 811 9 10 4 1 Construction 252 1 3 2 2 Industrial 257 4 3 1 Other 682 6 6 2 6 Total other New York State 3,353 32 % 40 % 16 % 12 % Pennsylvania Apartments/ Multifamily 342 4 % 4 % 2 % 4 % Office 407 7 6 2 2 Retail/ Services 534 7 9 4 2 Construction 137 2 1 1 1 Industrial 313 5 5 1 2 Other 707 14 12 2 1 Total Pennsylvania 2,440 39 % 37 % 12 % 12 % Maryland Apartments/ Multifamily 71 2 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Office 364 10 7 3 6 Retail/ Services 195 5 4 3 2 Construction 341 1 7 8 8 Industrial 125 3 4 2 Other 306 9 10 2 1 Total Maryland 1,402 30 % 33 % 19 % 18 % Other Apartments/ Multifamily 211 2 % 5 % 2 % 3 % Office 166 1 2 1 5 Retail/ Services 500 2 6 6 14 Construction 544 8 9 8 6 Industrial 103 1 2 2 1 Other 240 2 5 4 3 Total other 1,764 16 % 29 % 23 % 32 % Total commercial real estate loans $ 14,040 23 % 35 % 17 % 25 % 41 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 73% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 76% and 63%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 13% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2004. M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by third party investors and subsequently sold to such investors. Under this program, the Companys credit risk associated with those loans, which were sold with recourse, totaled $926 million and $825 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Those recourse amounts are equal to one third of each loans outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2004, $61 million of commercial real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $1 million at December 31, 2003. Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $4.1 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 7 totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2004, or approximately 4% of total loans and leases. Included in such loans at December 31, 2004 were $536 million of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Effective July 1, 2004, the Company began classifying such loans as commercial real estate loans, whereas prior to that date they were classified as residential real estate loans. The prior period amounts were not reclassified given that such amounts represented less than 1% of total loans and accordingly, were not considered significant to the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Included in residential real estate loans at December 31, 2003 were $246 million of such loans. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled $3.3 billion at December 31, 2004, including approximately 43% secured by properties located in New York State and 18% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2004, $790 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $723 million at December 31, 2003. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $431 million at December 31, 2004, or approximately 1% of total loans and leases, compared with $597 million (including the $246 million noted in the preceding paragraph) or 2% at December 31, 2003. Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 30% of the average loan portfolio during both 2004 and 2003, up from 27% in 2002. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit. Approximately 58% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004 were secured by properties in New York State and 22% and 17% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit totaled $3.5 billion in 2004, up 25% from $2.8 billion in 2003. The Company continues to pursue growing this portfolio, which has historically experienced a lower level of credit losses than other types of consumer loans. At December 31, 2004, 31% and 39% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 12% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2004, while no other consumer loan product represented more than 10%. During the 42 second half of 2004, the Company experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business, resulting from increased competition from other lenders, including financing incentives offered by automobile manufacturers. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $308 million in 2004, $527 million in 2003 and $556 million in 2002. The Company decided to cease origination of automobile leases during 2003, concentrating instead on its larger automobile loan origination business. Given the growth in the Companys automobile loan portfolio, the decision to cease origination of new auto leases did not have a significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, outstanding automobile leases totaled $205 million and $425 million, respectively. Table 8 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2004, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 49% of total loans and leases at the 2004 year end were to New York State customers, while 24% and 11% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively.

The investment securities portfolio averaged $8.0 billion in 2004, compared with $5.3 billion in 2003 and $3.1 billion in 2002. The previously discussed retention of mortgage backed securities related to the fourth quarter 2003 and 2002 securitizations of residential real estate loans of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, added approximately $1.5 billion and $817 million, respectively, to average investment securities in 2004 and 2003. Also contributing to 2004s higher average balance were purchases of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations during the year. Investment 43 securities obtained in the Allfirst transaction totaled approximately $1.3 billion on April 1, 2003. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company concluded that such declines were temporary in nature. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Money market assets, which are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks, interest earning trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities, averaged $74 million in 2004, $216 million in 2003 and $291 million in 2002. The amounts of investment securities and money market assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and money market assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Core deposits averaged $28.1 billion in 2004, $25.8 billion in 2003 and $17.6 billion in 2002. Core deposits assumed in connection with the Allfirst acquisition totaled approximately $10.7 billion on April 1, 2003. Due to the historically low interest rate environment over the past few years, the Company experienced a significant shift in the composition of core deposits during the three year period ended December 31, 2004. Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average core savings and noninterest bearing deposits rose during that period, while average time deposits under $100,000 decreased, exclusive of the impact of core deposits obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $223 million in 2004, $267 million in 2003 and $342 million in 2002. Funding provided by core deposits represented 62% of average earning assets in 2004, compared with 65% in 2003 and 61% in 2002. Table 9 summarizes average core deposits in 2004 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Table 9 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS Percentage increase (decrease) from 2004 2003 to 2004 2002 to 2003 (Dollars in millions) NOW accounts $ 550 (46 )% 34 % Savings deposits 15,248 15 49 Time deposits under $100,000 4,282 (10 ) 9 Noninterest bearing deposits 8,039 18 88 Total $ 28,119 9 % 47 % 44 Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.2 billion in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $3.1 billion in 2004, $1.4 billion in 2003 and $569 million in 2002. Average brokered time deposits totaled $1.4 billion in 2004, compared with $643 million in 2003 and $1.9 billion in 2002, and at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $1.9 billion and $827 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits at December 31, 2004 was 15 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $150 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts, which averaged $57 million, $70 million and $59 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Pittsburgh and Atlanta (together, the FHLB), and others as sources of funding. The average balance of short term borrowings was $5.1 billion in 2004, $4.3 billion in 2003 and $3.1 billion in 2002. Unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, included in short term borrowings averaged $4.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest component of short term borrowings and are obtained daily from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short term borrowings averaged $439 million in 2003 and $904 million in 2002, while there were no such borrowings during 2004. Also included in short term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank formed in November 2002. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Long term borrowings averaged $5.8 billion in 2004, $6.0 billion in 2003 and $4.2 billion in 2002. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $3.3 billion in 2004, $3.9 billion in 2003 and $3.0 billion in 2002, and subordinated capital notes of $1.3 billion in 2004, $1.2 billion in 2003 and $668 million in 2002. In anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. As described in notes 9 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2003 the Company applied new accounting provisions promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and removed the trusts that had issued trust preferred securities from its consolidated balance sheet. That change in financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the Company, no material or substantive impact on the Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003, and no impact on 2003s average balances noted herein. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long term borrowings were $710 million in 2004. Trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated debentures of M&T included in average long term borrowings in 2003 and 2002 totaled $595 million and $318 million, respectively. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain interest rate swap agreements have been entered into by the Company as part of its management of interest rate risk relating to long term borrowings. Further information on such interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. 45 Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, was 3.60% in 2004, down from 3.81% in 2003. The yield on earning assets during 2004 was 5.13%, down 29 basis points from 5.42% in 2003, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased 8 basis points to 1.53% from 1.61% in 2003. During the period from June 30, 2004 through December 31, 2004, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate five times, each increase representing a 25 basis point increment over the previously effective target rate. Lower rates earned on assets, including commercial real estate and automobile loans and investment securities, combined with short term liabilities that reprice more rapidly than many of the Companys variable rate earning assets, have caused a contraction of the net interest spread from 2003 to 2004. The yield on the Companys earning assets decreased 100 basis points in 2003 from 6.42% in 2002, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2003 was down 78 basis points from 2.39%. Lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained in the Allfirst merger contributed to the reduced yields on earning assets in 2003 when compared with 2002 and were the leading cause for the lower year over year net interest spread. The decreases in interest rates earned and paid also reflect generally lower market interest rates in 2003 as compared with 2002, including the impact of reductions by the Federal Reserve of its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate of 50 basis points in November 2002 and 25 basis points in June 2003. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 4.03% in 2002 to 3.81% in 2003. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest free funds averaged $8.3 billion in 2004, compared with $6.8 billion in 2003 and $4.0 billion in 2002. The increase in such funds in 2004 as compared with 2003 was largely due to the full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition and growth in other noninterest bearing deposits. The higher level of average net interest free funds in 2003 as compared with 2002 was also due largely to the impact of Allfirst. That acquisition provided, on average for 2003, noninterest bearing deposits of $2.8 billion and stockholders equity of $1.5 billion, partially offset by goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets of $1.5 billion and bank owned life insurance of $214 million. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.1 billion in 2004, $2.7 billion in 2003 and $1.2 billion in 2002. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $974 million in 2004, $858 million in 2003 and $604 million in 2002. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was .28% in both 2004 and 2003, and .33% in 2002. The modest decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2004 and 2003 compared with 2002 resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution, offset, in part, by higher balances of net interest free funds. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.88% in 2004, compared with 4.09% in 2003 and 4.36% in 2002. The net interest margin declined in each quarter of 2003 and either remained constant or declined in each quarter of 2004. As a result, the net interest margin of 3.82% in 2004s fourth quarter was the lowest quarterly net interest margin earned by the Company since the fourth quarter of 1998. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 46 2004 was $725 million. Under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates. As of December 31, 2004, all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $4 million at December 31, 2004, compared with a loss of $1 million at December 31, 2003. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 10.

Provision For Credit Losses The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. Reflecting improved credit quality, the provision for credit losses was reduced to $95 million in 2004 from $131 million in 2003 and $122 million in 2002. Net loan charge offs declined to $82 million in 2004 from $97 million and $108 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .22% in 47 2004, compared with .28% in 2003 and .42% in 2002. A summary of loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 11. Table 11 LOAN CHARGE OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Allowance for credit losses beginning balance $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 $ 374,703 $ 316,165 Charge offs during year Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 33,340 44,782 57,401 35,555 6,943 Real estate construction 2 88 Real estate mortgage 10,829 13,999 13,969 13,849 7,133 Consumer 74,856 68,737 53,124 44,750 28,855 Total charge offs 119,025 127,520 124,582 94,154 42,931 Recoveries during year Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 13,581 12,517 3,129 3,949 1,199 Real estate construction 4 Real estate mortgage 4,051 3,436 2,333 4,027 3,551 Consumer 19,700 15,047 11,370 10,871 9,201 Total recoveries 37,332 31,004 16,832 18,847 13,951 Net charge offs 81,693 96,516 107,750 75,307 28,980 Provision for credit losses 95,000 131,000 122,000 103,500 38,000 Allowance for credit losses acquired during the year 146,300 22,112 49,518 Allowance related to loans sold or securitized (501 ) (3,198 ) (2,786 ) Allowance for credit losses ending balance $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 $ 374,703 Net charge offs as a percent of: Provision for credit losses 85.99 % 73.68 % 88.32 % 72.76 % 76.26 % Average loans and leases, net of unearned discount .22 % .28 % .42 % .31 % .16 % Allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans and leases, net of unearned discount, at year end 1.63 % 1.72 % 1.70 % 1.69 % 1.65 % Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, totaled $172 million or .45% of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2004, compared with $240 million or .67% at December 31, 2003 and $215 million or .84% at December 31, 2002. The significant decrease in nonperforming loans at the 2004 year end as compared with a year earlier reflects both a general improvement in repayment performance by borrowers and the sale of two large commercial loans during 2004. The increase in the amount of loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2003 as compared with December 31, 2002 reflects the inclusion of nonperforming loans obtained from Allfirst. 48 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $155 million at both December 31, 2004 and 2003, representing .40% and .43% of total loans and leases at those respective dates, compared with $154 million or .60% at December 31, 2002. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest included $121 million, $125 million and $129 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government related entities. Such guaranteed loans included one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with them, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government related entities and totaled $104 million at December 31, 2004, $122 million at December 31, 2003 and $124 million at December 31, 2002. Also included in loans guaranteed by government related entities were foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export Import Bank of the United States totaling $17 million and $1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 12. Table 12 NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOAN DATA December 31 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccrual loans $ 162,013 $ 232,983 $ 207,038 $ 180,344 $ 100,951 Renegotiated loans 10,437 7,309 8,252 10,128 9,688 Total nonperforming loans 172,450 240,292 215,290 190,472 110,639 Real estate and other assets owned 12,504 19,629 17,380 16,387 13,619 Total nonperforming assets $ 184,954 $ 259,921 $ 232,670 $ 206,859 $ 124,258 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more(a) $ 154,590 $ 154,759 $ 153,803 $ 146,899 $ 141,843 Government guaranteed loans included in totals above: Nonperforming loans $ 15,273 $ 19,355 $ 11,885 $ 10,196 $ 8,625 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more 120,700 124,585 129,114 113,600 102,505 Nonperforming loans to total loans and leases, net of unearned discount .45 % .67 % .84 % .76 % .49 % Nonperforming assets to total net loans and leases and real estate and other assets owned .48 % .73 % .90 % .82 % .55 % Accruing loans past due 90 days or more to total loans and leases, net of unearned discount .40 % .43 % .60 % .58 % .62 % (a) Predominately residential mortgage loans. Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. 49 Net charge offs of commercial real estate loans during 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $3 million, $6 million and $7 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming were $45 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $48 million at December 31, 2003 and $49 million at December 31, 2002. Net charge offs of commercial loans and leases aggregated $20 million in 2004, compared with $32 million in 2003 and $54 million in 2002. Included in 2002s net charge off total was the entire $17 million outstanding balance of two leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of that year. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases totaled $45 million at December 31, 2004, $105 million a year earlier and $102 million at December 31, 2002. As noted earlier, the decrease in such loans from the end of 2003 to the end of 2004 reflects the sale of two large commercial credits and the repayment performance of borrowers. Residential real estate loans charged off during 2004, net of recoveries, were $4 million, compared with $5 million in both 2003 and 2002. Nonperforming residential real estate loans at 2004s year end totaled $44 million, compared with $51 million and $37 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $127 million, $141 million and $142 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As previously discussed, a substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government related entities. Net charge offs of consumer loans and leases totaled $55 million in 2004, representing .49% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding during that year, compared with $54 million or .53% in 2003 and $42 million or .62% in 2002. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Indirect automobile loan and lease charge offs during 2004, 2003 and 2002, net of recoveries, were $37 million, $32 million and $21 million, respectively. Consumer loans and leases classified as nonperforming were $38 million or .35% of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2004, compared with $36 million or .33% at December 31, 2003 and $27 million or .37% at December 31, 2002. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $2 million at December 31, 2004 and $3 million at each of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that management believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective balance sheet date. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) significant growth in loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2004 in light of (i) the uncertain status of the overall economic recovery in many of the markets served by the Company; and (ii) the potential for continued declines in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania. Although the 2005 economic outlook predicts improved growth nationally, 50 concerns exist about sluggish job creation, which could cause consumer spending to slow; higher interest rates, which could adversely impact the housing market; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and sluggish commercial loan demand. In particular, economic growth in two of the Companys largest market areas, upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, is expected to significantly lag national averages. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following paragraphs describe these components. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all commercial and commercial real estate loans which are in nonaccrual status. Specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans greater than $250,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national and local economic conditions and trends; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions 51 served by the Company, specifically New York State and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (iv) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; (v) additional risk associated with growth in the Companys portfolio of consumer loans in recent years, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans; and (vi) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2004. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market was just .3%, or less than one third the national average. The manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse continued to experience weakness, including announced corporate layoffs in those areas. Job growth in other areas of the upstate New York and Pennsylvania regions served by the Company also lagged the national average. In contrast, in the Hudson Valley region of New York State, where the Companys presence is not as significant as in the areas noted above and where industrial employment was below the United States average, private sector job growth was more than one full percentage point higher than the national average (2.4% compared with 1.0% nationally). Also better than the national average for private sector job growth were the Maryland, District of Columbia, and northern Virginia regions. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness, lack of population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions and other factors, continue to indicate an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York and Pennsylvania where approximately 73% of its lending business is conducted. A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in table 13. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $106 million at December 31, 2004 and $164 million at December 31, 2003. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $17 million and $26 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .42% and ..29% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses from the end of 2003 to December 31, 2004 was largely attributable to the factors described herein, including the significantly poorer economic environment and performance in many of the major market regions served by the Company and managements lack of familiarity and long term experience evaluating the impact of changing economic conditions on the performance of borrowers located in market areas entered through the Allfirst acquisition. Given the prolonged underperformance of the economies of many of the regions served by the Company over a number of years and the significant size of the loan portfolio in the Companys new market regions entered through the Allfirst acquisition, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed 52 herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Table 13 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES December 31 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. $ 147,550 $ 186,902 $ 120,627 $ 130,156 $ 125,568 Real estate 166,910 170,493 152,758 139,848 122,218 Consumer 148,591 152,759 113,711 94,710 76,839 Unallocated 163,813 103,904 49,376 60,294 50,078 Total $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 $ 374,703 As a percentage of gross loans and leases outstanding Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 1.45 % 1.99 % 2.23 % 2.50 % 2.43 % Real estate .96 1.10 1.17 1.00 .97 Consumer 1.33 1.37 1.51 1.52 1.49 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2004 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $627 million or 1.63% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2004, compared with $614 million or 1.72% at December 31, 2003 and $436 million or 1.70% at December 31, 2002. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2004 reflects improvement in various credit factors, including the already discussed decreases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses reflect sustained positive trends and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios decline, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans will decrease in future periods. On the April 1, 2003 acquisition date, Allfirst had an allowance for credit losses of $146 million, or 1.43% of Allfirsts loans then outstanding. Immediately following the acquisition, the combined balance sheet of M&T and Allfirst included an allowance for credit losses of $591 million, or 1.62% of the $36.5 billion of then outstanding loans. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 364%, 256% and 203%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows a consistent methodology as described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality: For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 10 basis point increase in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. 53 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were: For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5 basis point decrease in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $52 million in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $15 million reduction in such losses could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties and properties used in providing retail goods and services in the New York City metropolitan area each represented 5% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2004. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2004. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $230 million at December 31, 2004, or .6% of total loans and leases. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $13 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $20 million and $17 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other Income Other income rose 13% to $943 million in 2004 from $831 million in 2003. The increase in such income was attributable to the full year impact of revenues related to operations in market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Excluding Allfirst related revenues, higher levels of service charges on deposit accounts, letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related sales commissions and other revenues were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues. Other income in 2003 was 62% higher than the $512 million earned in 2002. Approximately $279 million of the increase in 2003 was attributable to revenues related to operations or market areas associated with Allfirst. Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the improvement. Mortgage banking revenues were $124 million in 2004, $149 million in 2003 and $116 million in 2002. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities are largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program. The operations relating to this program were acquired as part of the Allfirst transaction. Residential mortgage banking revenues, which consist of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, declined 23% to $100 million in 2004 from $129 million in 2003. A lower level of loan originations in 2004 as compared with 2003 was the most significant factor causing the decrease in revenues. Higher origination activity in 2003 reflected the impact of historically low levels of interest rates during that year that produced an extremely favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers. Also contributing to 2004s decreased revenues was the adoption of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. In March 2004, the SEC issued SAB No. 105, which provides guidance regarding the accounting for loans held for sale and loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. In accordance with SAB No. 105, effective April 1, 2004, value ascribable to loan cash flows that will ultimately be realized in connection with mortgage servicing activities should not be included in the determination of fair value of loans held for sale or commitments to originate loans for sale, but rather should only be recognized at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold. The Companys adoption of the SEC guidance resulted in a deferral of mortgage banking revenues of approximately $6 million. Neither 54 the amount or timing of receipt of such cash flows nor the economic value of the loans and commitments have changed as a result of this accounting guidance. Residential mortgage banking revenues in 2003 were 11% higher than the $116 million earned in 2002. The higher revenues in 2003 were due to the impact of the favorable environment for loan origination and refinancing activities by consumers noted above. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors aggregated approximately $4.8 billion in 2004, compared with $5.9 billion in 2003 and $5.7 billion in 2002. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $32 million in 2004, down from $65 million in 2003 and $54 million in 2002. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others increased to $57 million in 2004 from $54 million in 2003 and $53 million in 2002. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $6 million, $5 million and $4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $14.9 billion at December 31, 2004, $13.6 billion a year earlier and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2002, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $1.6 billion, $1.0 billion and $586 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $133 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $129 million and $103 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were $13 million at December 31, 2004, $8 million a year earlier and $6 million at December 31, 2002 of purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre determined rates were $764 million and $422 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004, $824 million and $459 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $1.5 billion and $825 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Net unrealized gains on residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $3 million, $7 million and $15 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Changes in such net unrealized gains are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net decreases in revenue in 2004 of $4 million (reflecting a $6 million decrease attributable to the implementation of SAB No. 105) and in 2003 of $8 million. A $7 million increase in net unrealized gains added to mortgage banking revenues in 2002. Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $25 million and $20 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, including $13 million of revenues from loan origination and sales activities in each respective year, and $12 million and $7 million, respectively, of loan servicing revenues. Commercial mortgage banking revenues in 2004 and 2003 were predominantly related to operations obtained in the Allfirst acquisition, as previously noted. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets totaled $22 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $4.1 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and included $926 million and $825 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans were $167 million and $72 million, respectively, commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $106 million and $71 million, respectively, and commercial mortgage loans held for sale were $61 million and $1 million, respectively. Revenues from service charges on deposit accounts increased 18% to $366 million in 2004 from $310 million in 2003. Approximately 80% of that year over year increase was in regions associated with Allfirst and was largely due to the full year impact of that transaction. Deposit account service charges in 2003 were 85% higher than $168 million in 2002. Fees for services provided to customers in areas formerly served by Allfirst contributed $127 million to such revenue in 2003. The remaining increase was largely the result of fee increases for check processing services on retail customer transaction accounts. 55 Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income increased 19% to $136 million in 2004 from $115 million in 2003 due to the full year impact of the Allfirst transaction. Trust income rose 91% in 2003 from $60 million in 2002, and included $55 million of revenues associated with the operations obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. During 2004 and 2003, increases in market values of equity securities were offset by lower managed balances of proprietary mutual funds. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, were $128.4 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with $134.5 billion at December 31, 2003. Trust assets under management totaled $22.9 billion and $24.4 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $54 million in 2004, 5% higher than $51 million in 2003. Brokerage services income was $43 million in 2002. The higher levels of such income in 2004 and 2003 as compared with 2002 were the result of revenues earned in the former Allfirst regions. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $19 million in 2004, $16 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002. The higher gains in 2004 and 2003 as compared with 2002 were due in part to increased volumes of trading assets and liabilities and reflect fees and market value changes related to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed with customers associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Offsetting trading positions are entered into by the Company to minimize the risks involved with these transactions. Also contributing to the rise in such gains in 2003 from 2002 were market value increases of $6 million in trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in deferred compensation related liabilities is included in other costs of operations. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $40 million and $39 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company sold bank investment securities resulting in gains of $3 million and $2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared with losses of $608 thousand in 2002. Other revenues from operations rose to $240 million in 2004 from $188 million in 2003 and $122 million in 2002. Included in the 2004 and 2003 totals were approximately $93 million and $58 million, respectively of revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with Allfirst. Higher letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related sales commissions and other revenues also contributed to the higher revenues in 2004 as compared with 2003. Factors contributing to the increase from 2002 to 2003 not related to Allfirst included higher revenues from merchant discount and credit card activities and letter of credit and other credit related fees. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit related fees totaled $74 million ($37 million Allfirst related), $54 million ($24 million Allfirst related) and $26 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in such fees in 2004 as compared with 2003 not specifically related to Allfirst was the result of higher sales of letter of credit products and increased fees earned from loan syndication activities. Tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $48 million ($17 million Allfirst related), $45 million ($12 million Allfirst related) and $33 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $28 million in 2004 ($11 million Allfirst related), $26 million in 2003 ($7 million Allfirst related) and $13 million in 2002. Insurance related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $22 million in 2004, compared with $18 million and $15 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. ATM usage fees aggregated $22 million ($8 million Allfirst related) in 2004, compared with $19 million ($6 million Allfirst related) in 2003 and $12 million in 2002. Other Expense Other expense increased 5% to $1.52 billion in 2004 from $1.45 billion in 2003. Other expense totaled $962 million in 2002. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $75 million, $78 million and 56 $51 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and merger related expenses of $60 million in 2003. There were no merger related expenses in 2004 or 2002. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.44 billion in 2004, up 10% from $1.31 billion in 2003. A significant portion of the increase in such expenses was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related operating expenses in 2004 compared with nine months of similar expenses in 2003. Also contributing to the higher expense level in 2004 was the $25 million charitable contribution already discussed. Noninterest operating expenses were $910 million in 2002. The April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst was the predominant factor contributing to the higher expense level in 2003 as compared with 2002. Nevertheless, because the acquired operations of Allfirst were integrated with the operations the Company previously had throughout the last nine months of 2003 and in 2004, the Companys higher operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to the acquired operations of Allfirst or to the Company as it existed prior to the transaction. Partially offsetting the higher level of expenses in 2003 was a $30 million decline in charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Such impairment charges were $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. The Company recognized a partial recovery of the capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights impairment valuation allowance of $4 million in 2004. Table 3 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense and a summary of merger related expenses. Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $807 million in 2004, 9% higher than $740 million in 2003. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $497 million in 2002. Expenses related to the acquired operations of Allfirst were the leading contributors to the rise in salaries and employee benefits during the past two years. The Company recognizes expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting for all stock based compensation granted to employees after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002 included $48 million, $43 million and $41 million, respectively, of stock based compensation. Pension benefit expense is a significant cost to the Company and totaled $30 million in 2004, $24 million in 2003, and $6 million in 2002. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. These assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of these assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment. The Companys 2004 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long term rate of return on assets of 8.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.91%; and a discount rate of 6.25%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $1 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance promulgated in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, reflects the long term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, 57 and has the effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $99 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $2 million in each of 2004 and 2003. Similar amortization in 2002 was not significant. Reflecting declines in the discount rate used to value pension plan obligations from 6.75% at December 31, 2002 to 6.25% at December 31, 2003 and 6.00% at December 31, 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation of certain of the Companys pension plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $116 million at December 31, 2004 and $86 million at December 31, 2003. The lower discount rate resulted from declines in market rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to payment of the pension benefits. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, the Company was required to have a recorded pension liability for those plans that was at least equal to $116 million at December 31, 2004 and $86 million at December 31, 2003. As a result, as of December 31, 2003 the Company increased its previously recorded pension liability by $21 million with a corresponding reduction of other comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $12 million. A combination of investment returns on plan assets during 2004, a 25 basis point decline in the discount rate assumption to 6.00% and favorable demographic experience, caused that additional minimum liability required under SFAS No. 87 to remain virtually unchanged as of December 31, 2004. A further 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2004 to 5.75% would have resulted in increases in the accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations of all pension plans of $21 million and $26 million, respectively. Under that scenario, the minimum pension liability adjustment would have been $42 million rather than the $21 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased the accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations of all pension plans by $20 million and $25 million, respectively. Under this latter scenario, the minimum pension liability adjustment would have been $1 million as of December 31, 2004. The Company did not make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2003 or 2004. In 2002, the Company contributed $19 million to its qualified pension plans during that years fourth quarter. As a result of such contribution, there was no excess of accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of assets held by the Companys qualified pension plans as of December 31, 2002. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. The number of full time equivalent employees was 12,678 at December 31, 2004, compared with 13,305 and 8,726 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses aggregated $634 million in 2004, 10% above $578 million in 2003. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $413 million in 2002. The full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition was a significant contributor to the higher expense levels during 2004 as compared with 2003, when only nine months of Allfirst related operating expenses were incurred. Also contributing to the increase in expenses in 2004 was the $25 million charitable contribution already discussed. The Allfirst acquisition was the most significant factor resulting in the higher nonpersonnel operating expense level in 2003 as compared with 2002. Increased expenses for amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and professional services also contributed to the higher expenses in both 2004 and 2003 as compared with the immediately preceding years. Partially offsetting those higher expenses were lower charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, which totaled $2 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. During 2004, a $4 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was recognized. Those adjustments to the valuation allowance resulted from changes in the 58 estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflect the impact of changing interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan prepayments. Information about the assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the estimated impact of changes in those assumptions are included in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $344 million in 2004, compared with $277 million in 2003 and $219 million in 2002. The effective tax rates were 32.3%, 32.5% and 32.4% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company reorganized two of its subsidiaries which altered the taxable status of such subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions thereby decreasing the Companys effective state income tax rate. As a result of the reorganizations, both income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2004 were reduced by $12 million. The Companys effective income tax rate in future periods is not expected to be significantly different from what it otherwise would have been had the subsidiary reorganizations not occurred. Nevertheless, the effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations attributable to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates and any changes in income tax regulations, or interpretations of such regulations, by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $248 million at December 31, 2004 and $234 million at December 31, 2003. Such assets included $230 million and $218 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. The most significant funding source for the Company has historically been core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 59% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2004, compared with 67% and 60% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLB and others. M&T Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $6.1 billion at December 31, 2004. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York totaling approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2004 or 2003. 59 The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital notes to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. In anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to provide liquidity to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $565 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings aggregated $3.7 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. Offshore branch deposits have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings, as noted earlier, and such deposits outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 totaled $4.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and generally matured on the next business day. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 14. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

The VRDBs are enhanced by a direct pay letter of credit provided by M&T Bank. Holders of the VRDBs generally have the right to sell the bonds to the remarketing agent with seven days notice, which could result in M&T Bank owning the VRDBs for some period of time until such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $14 million and $22 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At both December 31, 2004 and 2003, the total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by an 60 M&T Bank letter of credit was $1.5 billion. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2004 are summarized in table 16. Off balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 16 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2004 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments. 61 Table 16 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS Less Than One One to Three Three to Five Over Five December 31, 2004 Year Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Payments due for contractual obligations Time deposits $ 4,628,441 $ 2,192,981 $ 247,308 $ 159,784 $ 7,228,514 Deposits at foreign office 4,232,932 4,232,932 Federal funds purchased and agreements to repurchase securities 3,924,576 3,924,576 Other short term borrowings 779,088 779,088 Long term borrowings 1,383,167 1,150,017 1,448,377 2,366,998 6,348,559 Operating leases 46,887 73,374 48,778 83,333 252,372 Other 36,248 16,529 10,371 45,975 109,123 Total $ 15,031,339 $ 3,432,901 $ 1,754,834 $ 2,656,090 $ 22,875,164 Other commitments Commitments to extend credit $ 6,398,751 $ 3,182,347 $ 2,694,065 $ 1,440,851 $ 13,716,014 Standby letters of credit 1,221,698 1,138,133 620,778 182,292 3,162,901 Commercial letters of credit 37,616 18,219 1,620 57,455 Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts 7,916 169,581 115,863 875,157 1,168,517 Commitments to sell real estate loans 931,924 931,924 Total $ 8,597,905 $ 4,508,280 $ 3,432,326 $ 2,498,300 $ 19,036,811 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases is the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2004 approximately $560 million was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2004. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2003. On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not currently anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks. 62 Table 17 MATURITY AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT YIELD OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES One Year One to Five to Over December 31, 2004 or Less Five Years Ten Years Ten Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Investment securities available for sale(a) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Carrying value $ 2,659 $ 318,070 $ 11,122 $ $ 331,851 Yield 1.98 % 3.52 % 3.49 % % 3.51 % Obligations of states and political subdivisions Carrying value 13,570 38,552 36,563 21,087 109,772 Yield 7.10 % 5.89 % 4.88 % 8.12 % 6.13 % Mortgage backed securities(b) Government issued or guaranteed Carrying value 193,053 827,268 1,084,206 1,528,732 3,633,259 Yield 3.56 % 3.58 % 3.66 % 4.17 % 3.85 % Privately issued Carrying value 141,855 536,859 380,557 2,344,896 3,404,167 Yield 3.98 % 4.00 % 4.91 % 4.65 % 4.55 % Other debt securities Carrying value 32,038 13,906 1,230 143,928 191,102 Yield 6.21 % 3.90 % 5.38 % 5.03 % 5.15 % Equity securities Carrying value 384,566 Yield 4.01 % Total investment securities available for sale Carrying value 383,175 1,734,655 1,513,678 4,038,643 8,054,717 Yield 4.05 % 3.75 % 4.00 % 4.50 % 4.20 % Investment securities held to maturity Obligations of states and political subdivisions Carrying value 73,085 7,720 7,822 6,393 95,020 Yield 2.81 % 6.35 % 7.85 % 11.43 % 4.09 % Other debt securities Carrying value 561 2,469 3,030 Yield 8.32 % 5.14 % 5.73 % Total investment securities held to maturity Carrying value 73,085 7,720 8,383 8,862 98,050 Yield 2.81 % 6.35 % 7.88 % 9.68 % 4.14 % Other investment securities 321,852 Total investment securities Carrying value $ 456,260 $ 1,742,375 $ 1,522,061 $ 4,047,505 $ 8,474,619 Yield 3.85 % 3.76 % 4.02 % 4.51 % 4.04 % (a) Investment securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair value.

The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $725 million. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/ Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Companys Risk Forum Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under interest rate scenarios assuming incremental 100 and 200 basis point changes to the aforementioned base scenario. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. Table 19 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. 64 Table 19 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES Calculated Increase (Decrease) in Projected Net Interest Income December 31 2004 2003 Changes in interest rates (Dollars in thousands) +200 basis points $ (20,848 ) $ (4,504 ) +100 basis points (8,228 ) (190 ) 100 basis points 12,386 (12,945 ) 200 basis points 4,900 (13,064 ) The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. As noted above, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period, including incremental 100 and 200 basis point rate changes, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, and interest rate differentials (spreads) between and within maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, table 20 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. 65 Table 20 CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA Three Months Four to One to After December 31, 2004 or Less Twelve Months Five Years Five Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Loans and leases, net $ 19,112,923 $ 3,085,353 $ 9,111,099 $ 7,089,102 $ 38,398,477 Money market assets 95,800 100 650 96,550 Investment securities 2,641,605 1,041,063 1,516,615 3,275,336 8,474,619 Total earning assets 21,850,328 4,126,516 10,628,364 10,364,438 46,969,646 NOW accounts 828,999 828,999 Savings deposits 14,721,663 14,721,663 Time deposits 3,293,940 1,859,127 2,034,091 41,356 7,228,514 Deposits at foreign office 4,229,351 3,581 4,232,932 Total interest bearing deposits 23,073,953 1,862,708 2,034,091 41,356 27,012,108 Short term borrowings 4,703,664 4,703,664 Long term borrowings 2,708,759 133,108 1,231,997 2,274,695 6,348,559 Total interest bearing liabilities 30,486,376 1,995,816 3,266,088 2,316,051 38,064,331 Interest rate swaps (695,000 ) 155,000 30,000 510,000 Periodic gap $ (9,331,048 ) $ 2,285,700 $ 7,392,276 $ 8,558,387 Cumulative gap (9,331,048 ) (7,045,348 ) 346,928 8,905,315 Cumulative gap as a % of total earning assets (19.9 )% (15.0 )% .7 % 19.0 % The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the Risk Forum Committee. However, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities. The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $5.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2003. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $512 million and $548 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $160 million and $94 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $215 million and $139 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $40 million and $39 million, respectively, related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at both 66 December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $49 million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2004 was $5.7 billion or 10.82% of total assets, compared with $5.7 billion or 11.47% at December 31, 2003 and $3.2 billion or 9.66% at December 31, 2002. On a per share basis, stockholders equity was $49.68 at the 2004 year end, 4% higher than $47.55 at December 31, 2003 and 43% above $34.82 at December 31, 2002. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $23.62 at December 31, 2004, compared with $21.97 and $22.04 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented in table 3. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 11.07%, 10.89% and 9.48% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. To complete the acquisition of Allfirst on April 1, 2003, M&T issued 26,700,000 shares of common stock to AIB resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $2.0 billion. The value ascribed to the common shares issued to AIB was based on the market value of M&T common stock at the time the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and AIB. Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges; and minimum pension liability adjustments. Net unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities were $5 million, or $.04 per common share, at December 31, 2004, compared with gains of $38 million, or $.32 per common share, at December 31, 2003 and $55 million, or $.60 per common share, at December 31, 2002. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. Net unrealized fair value losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, were $622 thousand at December 31, 2002, representing less than $.01 per share at that date. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003. The minimum pension liability adjustment, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $12 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, or by $.11 per share and $.10 per share on those respective dates. There was no such adjustment at December 31, 2002. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Cash dividends paid in 2004 on M&Ts common stock aggregated $188 million, compared with $135 million and $97 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2002 from $.25 per share to $.30 per share, and again in 2004s first quarter to $.40 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $1.60 in 2004, up from $1.20 in 2003 and $1.05 in 2002. M&T repurchased 6,520,800 shares of its common stock in 2004 and 3,007,585 shares in 2002, at a cost of $610 million and $240 million, respectively. In December 2004, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2004, M&T had repurchased a total of 152,900 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $106.95 per share. M&T had discontinued purchases of its common stock 67 during the third quarter of 2002, determining instead that it would use the Companys internal generation of capital to support the acquisition of Allfirst. As a result, there were no common stock repurchases in 2003. However, M&T resumed purchases of its common stock in January 2004, and completed repurchase plans during 2004 that had been announced in November 2001 and February 2004. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2004, core capital included $687 million of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $1.1 billion of subordinated capital notes. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after tax effect of merger related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 18.12% in 2004, 23.35% in 2003 and 19.78% in 2002. Fourth Quarter Results Net income rose 15% to $192 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 from $167 million in the year earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.62 and $1.66, respectively, in 2004s final quarter, compared with $1.35 and $1.39, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity, net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 1.45% and 13.37%, respectively, compared with 1.35% and 11.77%, respectively, in the year earlier period. Net operating income in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased to $202 million, 11% higher than $182 million in the final quarter of 2003. Diluted net operating earnings per share increased 16% to $1.70 in the recently completed quarter from $1.47 in the year earlier quarter. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.62% and 29.69%, respectively, in 2004s fourth quarter, compared with 1.57% and 28.33%, respectively, in the corresponding quarter of 2003. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $10 million ($.08 per diluted share) and $13 million ($.11 per diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Merger related expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $2 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.01 per diluted share. There were no merger related expenses incurred during 2004. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2004 and 2003 are provided in table 22. Taxable equivalent net interest income grew to $446 million in the recent quarter, up 5% from $426 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. A 9% increase in average earning assets partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin resulted in the improvement. Average earning assets totaled $46.5 billion in the three month period ended December 31, 2004, up from $42.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter aggregated $38.1 billion, 5% higher than $36.4 billion during 2003s final quarter. Average loan balances in 2003 reflect the impact of fourth quarter transactions in that year in which M&T converted residential real estate loans of $1.3 billion into mortgage backed securities. Those transactions are described in Net Interest Income/ Lending and Funding Activities and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The yield on earning assets was 5.24% in the last quarter of 2004, up 8 basis points from 5.16% in the year earlier period. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 1.75% in the fourth quarter of 2004, up 27 basis points from 1.48% in the corresponding period in 2003. The resulting net interest spread was 3.49% in 2004s final quarter, compared with 3.68% in the fourth quarter of 2003. As a result, the Companys net interest margin declined to 3.82% in the recent quarter from 3.96% in the final quarter of 2003. Given that rates paid on interest bearing liabilities tend to re price more quickly than yields on many earning assets, rising short 68 term interest rates in the second half of 2004 have caused a contraction of the net interest spread when comparing the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003. The provision for credit losses was $28 million in the fourth quarter of both 2004 and 2003. Net charge offs of loans totaled $27 million in the recent quarter, compared with $32 million in the year earlier quarter. As an annualized percentage of average loans and leases, net charge offs were ..29% and .35% in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other income aggregated $238 million in the final quarter of 2004, compared with $234 million in 2003s fourth quarter. Higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts were partially offset by lower gains on the sale of bank investment securities. Noninterest expense in the final three months of 2004 totaled $362 million, 4% below $378 million in the year earlier period. Included in such amounts are expenses considered nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $16 million and $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively, and merger related expenses of $3 million in 2003s fourth quarter. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $346 million in the recent quarter, down from the $354 million recorded in 2003s fourth quarter. The decrease in operating expenses was due largely to lower equipment and net occupancy, advertising and promotion, and other operating expenses, partially offset by a smaller reduction in expenses relating to the reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Operating expenses in the final quarter of 2004 reflect a $222 thousand reduction in expenses resulting from a partial reversal of that valuation allowance, compared with a $4 million reduction of such valuation allowance in 2003s fourth quarter. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003 was 50.6% and 53.9%, respectively. Table 22 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2004 and 2003. 69 Table 21 QUARTERLY TRENDS 2004 Quarters 2003 Quarters Fourth Third Second First Fourth Third Second First Earnings and dividends Amounts in thousands, except per share Interest income (taxable equivalent basis) $ 613,012 $ 587,598 $ 565,090 $ 550,362 $ 554,673 $ 568,319 $ 580,704 $ 439,182 Interest expense 166,755 143,771 126,805 126,829 129,173 133,539 145,506 119,592 Net interest income 446,257 443,827 438,285 423,533 425,500 434,780 435,198 319,590 Less: provision for credit losses 28,000 17,000 30,000 20,000 28,000 34,000 36,000 33,000 Other income 237,559 244,925 232,334 228,151 233,757 231,594 232,897 132,847 Less: other expense 361,922 406,922 357,207 389,967 378,355 396,400 431,147 242,278 Income before income taxes 293,894 264,830 283,412 241,717 252,902 235,974 200,948 177,159 Applicable income taxes 97,624 73,843 94,538 77,997 81,801 75,329 62,600 56,998 Taxable equivalent adjustment 4,065 4,546 4,489 4,230 4,200 4,182 4,308 3,623 Net income $ 192,205 $ 186,441 $ 184,385 $ 159,490 $ 166,901 $ 156,463 $ 134,040 $ 116,538 Per common share data Basic earnings $ 1.66 $ 1.59 $ 1.56 $ 1.33 $ 1.39 $ 1.31 $ 1.12 $ 1.26 Diluted earnings 1.62 1.56 1.53 1.30 1.35 1.28 1.10 1.23 Cash dividends $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 $ .30 $ .30 $ .30 $ .30 Average common shares outstanding Basic 115,953 116,897 118,224 119,738 120,141 119,727 119,393 92,399 Diluted 119,010 119,665 120,655 122,316 123,328 122,593 122,366 95,062 Performance ratios, annualized Return on Average assets 1.45 % 1.42 % 1.45 % 1.29 % 1.35 % 1.24 % 1.10 % 1.43 % Average common stockholders equity 13.37 % 13.02 % 13.12 % 11.19 % 11.77 % 11.37 % 10.00 % 14.46 % Net interest margin on average earning assets (taxable equivalent basis) 3.82 % 3.85 % 3.92 % 3.92 % 3.96 % 4.02 % 4.12 % 4.32 % Nonperforming loans to total loans and leases, net of unearned discounts .45 % .48 % .51 % .70 % .67 % .77 % .86 % .88 % Efficiency ratio(a) 52.95 % 59.08 % 53.27 % 60.07 % 57.18 % 56.60 % 59.59 % 52.37 % Net operating (tangible) results(b) Net income (in thousands) $ 202,215 $ 197,822 $ 196,158 $ 172,423 $ 181,594 $ 182,670 $ 169,436 $ 127,231 Diluted net income per common share 1.70 1.65 1.63 1.41 1.47 1.49 1.38 1.34 Annualized return on Average tangible assets 1.62 % 1.60 % 1.64 % 1.48 % 1.57 % 1.55 % 1.48 % 1.62 % Average tangible common stockholders equity 29.69 % 29.42 % 30.12 % 26.02 % 28.33 % 30.67 % 29.89 % 24.68 % Efficiency ratio(a) 50.56 % 56.38 % 50.39 % 56.81 % 53.93 % 53.22 % 56.20 % 49.81 % Balance sheet data In millions, except per share Average balances Total assets(c) $ 52,725 $ 52,170 $ 51,251 $ 49,915 $ 49,123 $ 50,024 $ 49,010 $ 33,061 Total tangible assets(c) 49,647 49,075 48,137 46,781 45,968 46,848 45,822 31,884 Earning assets 46,535 45,874 44,923 43,444 42,672 42,885 42,386 30,004 Investment securities 8,326 8,195 7,943 7,516 6,212 5,837 5,654 3,638 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 38,142 37,611 36,904 35,843 36,361 36,953 36,632 25,789 Deposits 34,768 34,569 33,702 32,856 32,357 31,954 31,189 21,078 Stockholders equity(c) 5,721 5,697 5,654 5,732 5,625 5,461 5,377 3,267 Tangible stockholders equity(c) 2,710 2,675 2,619 2,665 2,543 2,363 2,274 2,090 At end of quarter Total assets(c) $ 52,939 $ 52,887 $ 52,094 $ 50,832 $ 49,826 $ 50,259 $ 50,399 $ 33,444 Total tangible assets(c) 49,869 49,801 48,990 47,708 46,681 47,093 47,211 32,271 Earning assets 46,970 46,454 45,757 44,335 43,134 43,257 43,038 30,396 Investment securities 8,475 8,437 8,161 7,656 7,259 5,957 5,946 4,146 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 38,398 37,950 37,522 36,515 35,772 37,160 37,002 26,224 Deposits 35,429 34,976 34,954 33,341 33,115 32,414 32,539 21,924 Stockholders equity(c) 5,730 5,710 5,657 5,734 5,717 5,572 5,433 3,313 Tangible stockholders equity(c) 2,724 2,694 2,629 2,674 2,642 2,482 2,327 2,140 Equity per common share 49.68 49.11 48.21 48.17 47.55 46.49 45.46 35.81 Tangible equity per common share 23.62 23.17 22.40 22.47 21.97 20.71 19.47 23.13 Market price per common share High $ 108.75 $ 98.66 $ 92.70 $ 98.65 $ 98.98 $ 90.93 $ 90.91 $ 84.48 Low 95.40 86.80 82.90 88.08 87.50 83.65 79.00 74.71 Closing 107.84 95.70 87.30 89.85 98.30 87.30 84.22 78.58 (a) Excludes impact of merger related expenses and net securities transactions.

Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Commercial Banking segment contributed $218 million to net income, 25% higher than the $175 million earned in 2003. The improvement was largely attributable to higher net interest income of $46 million, service charges on deposit accounts of $9 million, and letter of credit and other credit related fees of $17 million. Included in that growth was the full year impact of the acquired Allfirst related operations in 2004, while 2003 included only nine months of such operating results. Higher average loan balances in non Allfirst regions and a $12 million decline in net charge offs also contributed to the higher net income in 2004. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were higher salaries, benefits and other operating expenses of $32 million, also largely attributable to the full year impact of Allfirst in 2004. Net income for this segment totaled $90 million in 2002. The rise in net income in 2003 as compared with 2002 was predominantly the result of the Allfirst acquisition, which contributed to increases in net interest income on loans of $52 million, service charges on deposit accounts of $36 million and credit related fees of $18 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $37 million. The improvement was also aided by a decline in net charge offs from 2002, largely the result of a $17 million loss in 2002 related to two commercial leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy. Net charge offs for the Commercial Banking segment were $11 million in 2004, $23 million in 2003 and $48 million in 2002. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/ multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. The Commercial Real Estate segment recorded net income of $135 million in 2004, 11% higher than $122 million in 2003. The improvement was due to higher net interest income of $22 million, primarily due to higher loan balances outstanding of $608 million, or 9%, largely the result of growth in the markets already served by the Company and also reflecting the full year impact of balances obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Also contributing to the improved performance were higher commercial mortgage banking revenues of $5 million, largely from the origination, sales and servicing of loans related to the Companys participation in the FNMA DUS program, and increased letter of credit and other credit related fees. The higher revenues were offset, in part, by a $13 million increase in operating expenses, largely the result of the full year impact of salaries, benefits and other operating expenses related to the business obtained from Allfirst. Net income in 2003 for the Commercial Real Estate 72 segment was 32% above the $92 million earned in 2002. The increase was due to higher net interest income of $37 million, largely the result of average loan balances acquired in the Allfirst transaction and a higher net interest margin on loans in the non Allfirst regions, and commercial mortgage banking revenues of $20 million resulting largely from the Allfirst acquisition. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were higher salaries, benefits and other operating expenses that also resulted from the Allfirst transaction. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include foreign exchange, securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales. The Discretionary Portfolio segments net income was $117 million in 2004, up 35% from $86 million in 2003, primarily the result of a $42 million increase in net interest income resulting from higher average earning assets. The primary contributor to the higher earning assets was a higher average balance of investment securities, due largely to purchases of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations during 2004 and the full year impact of the retention of mortgage backed securities related to the previously discussed fourth quarter 2003 securitization of $1.2 billion of residential real estate loans. Also contributing to the favorable performance was a $2 million partial reversal during 2004 of a valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, compared with a $2 million addition to such allowance in 2003. This segments net income in 2002 was $64 million. The 34% increase in net income from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of higher net interest income from investment securities, including securities acquired in the Allfirst transaction. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states in the western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. Net income for the Residential Mortgage Banking segment totaled $28 million in 2004, down 57% from $66 million in 2003. That unfavorable variance reflects a $74 million decrease in revenues, due primarily to a lower level of loan originations in 2004 as compared with 2003. The higher origination activity in 2003 reflected the impact of historically low levels of interest rates during that year that produced a favorable environment for consumers to participate in origination and refinancing activities. Gains from the sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $9 million and $22 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Also contributing to the decline in revenues was the $6 million impact of the adoption of SAB No. 105, as discussed in Other Income included herein. Partially offsetting the decline in revenues was a $2 million partial reversal during 2004 of a valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights (there was no change to the segments valuation allowance during 2003) and a $9 million decrease in salaries and benefits expenses reflecting the lower loan originations in 2004. Net income in 2003 for this segment was 75% higher than the $38 million earned in 2002. The 2003 results include a $34 million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities, including higher gains from sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment of $13 million, and a $12 million increase in net interest income, due largely to higher average balances of outstanding loans and deposits. Also contributing to the segments improved net income was a decrease in the provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights, which was $30 million lower than in 2002. Partially offsetting the revenue increases noted above were higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of $29 million, exclusive of the impact of changes in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights already noted. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels which include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, 73 the District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment contributed net income of $235 million in 2004, up 23% from $192 million in 2003. This favorable performance was due mainly to increases in net interest income of $57 million and service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $54 million, offset, in part, by higher expenses of $51 million, all substantially related to the acquired Allfirst franchise. A $14 million decline in the provision for credit losses, due to slower growth in indirect automobile loan balances, also contributed to the rise in net income. This segments earnings increased 20% in 2003 from $159 million in 2002. The favorable variance was largely the result of higher net interest income of $180 million and service charges on deposit accounts of $99 million, partially offset by higher expenses of $231 million, all largely attributable to the impact of the Allfirst acquisition. In the non Allfirst regions, a $62 million decrease in net interest income attributable to deposits, due to a 44 basis point decline in net interest margin, was partially offset by a $49 million increase in net interest income on loans, resulting from increases in indirect automobile loan and home equity line of credit balances outstanding of 51% and 27%, respectively. The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses, and, in 2003, merger related expenses resulting from the Allfirst acquisition. The previously mentioned $25 million charitable contribution made by M&T Bank to The M&T Charitable Foundation and the $12 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the reorganization of certain M&T subsidiaries are also reflected in the All Other categorys results for 2004. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $11 million and $67 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and net income of $14 million in 2002. The improvement from 2003 to 2004 was largely the result of merger related costs of $60 million included in 2003s results, higher noninterest income in 2004 due in part to the full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition, and the income tax expense reduction from the reorganization of certain subsidiaries. Partially offsetting those positive factors were the $25 million charitable contribution and higher expenses, largely due to twelve months of expenses relating to Allfirst in 2004 compared with nine months of such expenses in 2003. Contributing to the net loss in 2003 as compared with 2002s net income were higher expenses resulting largely from the Allfirst acquisition that under the Companys cost allocation methodologies were not allocated to the reportable segments. Recent Accounting Developments In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), an amendment of SFAS No. 123 which supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123R also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. 74 SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began recognizing expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in SFAS No. 123. Using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, financial information for prior periods was restated to reflect the impact of recognizing expense for stock based compensation in those years as well. The Company does not believe that the provisions of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of the Companys Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements. Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; credit losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock options to be issued in future periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi year contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Companys future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger and acquisition activities compared to the Companys expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other Future Factors. 75 Item 7A.
