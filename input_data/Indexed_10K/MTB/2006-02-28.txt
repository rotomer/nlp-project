Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading Forward Looking Statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular. In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None Item 2. Properties. Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices at One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, New York. This twenty one story headquarters building, containing approximately 278,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by M&T Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank and their subsidiaries occupy approximately 78% of the building and the remainder is leased to non affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2005, the cost of this property (including improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of accumulated depreciation, was $6.0 million. In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility in Buffalo, New York with approximately 365,000 rentable square feet of space at a cost of approximately $12 million. Approximately 89% of this facility, known as M&T Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its subsidiaries, with the remainder leased to non affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2005, the cost of this building (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was $11.7 million. M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in the Buffalo area which support certain back office and operations functions of the Company. The total square footage of these facilities approximates 213,000 square feet and their combined cost (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was $17.9 million at December 31, 2005. 24 M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with approximately 151,000 rentable square feet of space.

M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to M&Ts consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on M&Ts consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period.

See cross reference sheet for disclosures incorporated elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $55.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.). M&T Bank, with total assets of $54.4 billion at December 31, 2005, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 658 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency. M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $625 million at December 31, 2005, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. 29 On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. (Allfirst), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, from Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB), Dublin, Ireland. Allfirst Bank, Allfirsts primary bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Allfirst Bank operated 269 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia at the date of acquisition. As of the acquisition date, total consolidated assets of Allfirst and its subsidiaries were $16.5 billion, including $10.3 billion of loans and leases and $1.3 billion of investment securities, and total consolidated liabilities assumed were $14.5 billion, including $10.9 billion of deposits. The acquisition of Allfirst represented a major geographic expansion by M&T and created a strong Mid Atlantic banking franchise. AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding Allfirst common shares. The results of operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since April 1, 2003. The Company recorded approximately $1.8 billion of goodwill and $199 million of core deposit and other intangible assets as a result of the Allfirst acquisition. Merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $60 million ($39 million after tax effect). Such expenses were for professional services and temporary help associated with the conversion of systems and or integration of operations; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to Allfirsts customers; travel and relocation costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. There were no similar merger related expenses incurred during 2004 or 2005. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Allfirst merger were charges totaling $29 million, net of applicable income taxes ($48 million before tax effect), for severance costs for former Allfirst employees; investment banking and other professional fees; and termination of Allfirst contracts for various services. As of December 31, 2005, there were no significant amounts of unpaid merger related expenses or charges included in the determination of goodwill. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. 30 However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview The Companys net income for 2005 totaled $782 million or $6.73 of diluted earnings per common share, representing increases of 8% and 12%, respectively, from $723 million or $6.00 of diluted earnings per share in 2004. Basic earnings per common share were $6.88 in 2005, 12% higher than $6.14 in 2004. Net income in 2003 was $574 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $4.95 and $5.08, respectively. The after tax impact of merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition was $39 million ($60 million pre tax) or $.34 of diluted earnings per share and $.35 of basic earnings per share in 2003. There were no similar expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Net income represented a return on average assets in 2005 of 1.44%, compared with 1.40% in 2004 and 1.27% in 2003. The return on average common stockholders equity was 13.49% in 2005, 12.67% in 2004 and 11.62% in 2003. Excluding the impact of merger related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity in 2003 were 1.35% and 12.41%, respectively. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 3% to $1.81 billion in 2005 from $1.75 billion in 2004, largely due to higher average earning assets, which rose 6% to $48.1 billion in 2005 from $45.2 billion in 2004. The higher level of average earning assets was driven by increased balances of loans, leases and investment securities. Average loans and leases of $39.5 billion in 2005 were 6% higher than $37.1 billion in 2004, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $921 million, or 10%, commercial real estate loans of $1.1 billion, or 8%, and consumer real estate loans of $814 million, or 26%, offset by a $413 million, or 4% decline in consumer loans and leases. Average balances of investment securities rose 6% to $8.5 billion in 2005 from $8.0 billion in 2004. Partially offsetting the impact of growth in earning assets was a narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The net interest margin declined 31 11 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004, due largely to rising short term interest rates that produced a flattening of the yield curve in 2005 as compared with historic norms and had the effect of increasing rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earnings assets. Also as a result of higher average earning assets, taxable equivalent net interest income in 2004 was 8% higher than $1.62 billion in 2003. Average earning assets in 2004 increased 14% from $39.5 billion in 2003. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2004 increased $3.2 billion, or 9%, from $34.0 billion in 2003, largely due to the full year impact of loans obtained in the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst. Included in the 2003 average was the nine month impact of the $10.3 billion of loans and leases obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Net interest margin in 2004 declined 21 basis points from 4.09% in 2003, largely due to lower yields earned on loans and investment securities. The provision for credit losses was $88 million in 2005, down from $95 million in 2004 and $131 million in 2003. The lower levels of the provision during the past two years as compared with 2003 were reflective of favorable credit quality. Net charge offs declined to $77 million in 2005 from $82 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding decreased to .19% in 2005 from .22% in 2004 and .28% in 2003. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans. Noninterest income increased 1% to $950 million in 2005 from $943 million in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). A write down was taken on $133 million of variable rate preferred securities held in the Companys portfolio of available for sale investment securities. Although the securities are rated as investment grade, the Company recognized the impairment charge, in accordance with GAAP, in light of changing circumstances during 2005s third quarter that included an announced further delay in FNMAs ability to provide restated financial information about its results of operations until late 2006 and a further decline in the market value of certain of FHLMCs preferred stock issuances despite its release of operating results. However, because the preferred securities have been held in the available for sale investment securities portfolio, the unrealized losses had already been recorded as reductions of other comprehensive income and, therefore, no incremental reductions of investment securities or stockholders equity were required. Accordingly, the accounting treatment for the impairment charge made pursuant to GAAP had no significant effect on M&Ts consolidated balance sheet. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Noninterest income aggregated $831 million in 2003. The increase in such income in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related income in 2004 compared with nine months of similar income in 2003. Excluding Allfirst related revenues, higher levels of service charges on deposit accounts, letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related income were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues resulting from a lower level of loan originations in 2004. Noninterest expense in 2005 totaled $1.49 billion, down 2% from $1.52 billion in 2004. Noninterest expense in 2003 was $1.45 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $57 million, $75 million and $78 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and merger related expenses of $60 million in 2003. As already noted, there were no merger related expenses in 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.43 billion in 2005, $1.44 billion in 2004 and $1.31 billion in 2003. As compared with 2004, increases in the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and higher professional services expenses in 2005 were partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher 32 residential mortgage loan interest rates. Included in 2004s operating expenses was a $25 million tax deductible contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt private charitable foundation. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. A significant portion of the increase in noninterest expense in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related expenses in 2004 compared with nine months of similar expenses in 2003. Also contributing to the higher expenses in 2004 was the $25 million charitable contribution. The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 51.2% in 2005, improved from 53.5% in 2004 and 53.6% in 2003. If the $25 million charitable contribution was excluded from the computation, the efficiency ratio for 2004 would have been 52.6%.

(b) Interest income data are on a taxable equivalent basis. The taxable equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 39% for 2005, 2004 and 2002, 36% for 2003, and 37% for 2001. Supplemental Reporting of Non GAAP Results of Operations M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.1 billion at both December 31, 2004 and 2003. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $2.9 billion at 33 December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $35 million, $46 million and $48 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, in which M&T excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Net operating income rose 6% to $817 million in 2005 from $769 million in 2004. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2005 increased to $7.03, 10% higher than $6.38 in 2004. In 2003, net operating income totaled $661 million and diluted net operating earnings per share were $5.70. A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share is presented in table 2. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, net operating income was 1.60% in 2005, compared with 1.59% in 2004 and 1.55% in 2003. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 29.06% in 2005, compared with 28.76% and 28.49% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Including the effect of merger related expenses, net operating return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in 2003 was 1.46% and 26.80%, respectively. 34 A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity is presented in table 2.

Such assets totaled $48.1 billion in 2005, up 6% from $45.2 billion in 2004. Increases of 6% in each of average outstanding balances of loans and leases and average balances of investment securities contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting the positive impact on taxable equivalent net interest income of higher average earning assets was a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2005 grew 6% to $39.5 billion from $37.1 billion in 2004. The Company experienced growth in most major loan categories during 2005 as compared with 2004. Average commercial loans and leases rose 10% to $10.5 billion in 2005 from $9.5 billion in 2004, reflecting, in part, a $212 million rise in average automobile floor plan loans outstanding. Commercial real estate loans averaged $14.3 billion during 2005, up 8% from $13.3 billion in 2004. Contributing to that increase were $467 million of higher average balances of construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Average residential real estate loan balances increased 26% to $3.9 billion in 2005 from $3.1 billion in 2004. Higher residential real estate loans held for sale by M&T Mortgage Corporation were the most significant contributor to that increase. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.8 billion during 2005, down 4% from $11.2 billion in 2004. Average balances of automobile loans and leases decreased 16% to $3.7 billion in 2005 from $4.4 billion in 2004, largely due to the Companys decision to not match the pricing being offered by competitors. Partially offsetting the drop in automobile loan and lease balances was a 13% rise in average outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit to $4.0 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 8% to $1.75 billion in 2004 from $1.62 billion in 2003. That improvement reflected a 14% increase in average earning assets to $45.2 billion in 2004 from $39.5 billion in 2003, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.88% in 2004 from 4.09% in 2003. The growth in average earning assets reflects higher average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $37.1 billion in 2004, up 9% from 2003s average of $34.0 billion, and higher investment securities balances which averaged $8.0 billion in 2004, up 50% from $5.3 billion in 2003. The 2003 average loan and lease balance reflected the impact of $10.3 billion of loans obtained on April 1, 2003 in the Allfirst acquisition for the final nine months of that year, while the 2004 average balance reflected a full year impact of Allfirst related loans. The $10.3 billion of acquired loans were comprised of approximately $4.5 billion of commercial loans and leases (including $314 million of leveraged leases and $230 million of loans to foreign borrowers), $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million of residential real estate loans and $2.9 billion of consumer loans and leases. 36 Table 3 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT RATES 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate (Average balance in millions; interest in thousands) Assets Earning assets Loans and leases, net of unearned discount(a) Commercial, financial, etc. $ 10,455 $ 589,644 5.64 % 9,534 410,258 4.30 % 8,523 358,629 4.21 % 5,146 261,867 5.09 % 5,271 372,234 7.06 % Real estate commercial 14,341 941,017 6.56 13,264 763,134 5.75 11,573 706,022 6.10 9,498 661,382 6.96 9,224 732,162 7.94 Real estate consumer 3,925 235,364 6.00 3,111 184,125 5.92 3,777 232,454 6.15 4,087 285,055 6.98 4,354 328,979 7.55 Consumer 10,808 664,509 6.15 11,220 626,255 5.58 10,098 607,909 6.02 6,776 467,167 6.89 5,581 464,151 8.32 Total loans and leases, net 39,529 2,430,534 6.15 37,129 1,983,772 5.34 33,971 1,905,014 5.61 25,507 1,675,471 6.57 24,430 1,897,526 7.77 Money market assets Interest bearing deposits at banks 10 169 1.64 13 65 .51 14 147 1.03 6 76 1.32 4 116 3.10 Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities 23 808 3.55 8 134 1.60 147 1,875 1.28 272 4,455 1.63 63 2,027 3.22 Trading account 80 1,544 1.92 53 418 .79 55 647 1.18 13 247 1.86 13 413 3.16 Total money market assets 113 2,521 2.22 74 617 .83 216 2,669 1.24 291 4,778 1.64 80 2,556 3.20 Investment securities(b) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 3,479 134,528 3.87 4,169 158,953 3.81 2,599 106,209 4.09 1,292 81,412 6.30 1,709 113,908 6.67 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 180 10,860 6.04 218 15,017 6.90 251 15,827 6.30 279 17,828 6.40 332 24,483 7.37 Other 4,817 227,562 4.72 3,610 157,703 4.37 2,494 113,159 4.54 1,552 76,659 4.94 1,267 80,925 6.39 Total investment securities 8,476 372,950 4.40 7,997 331,673 4.15 5,344 235,195 4.40 3,123 175,899 5.63 3,308 219,316 6.63 Total earning assets 48,118 2,806,005 5.83 45,200 2,316,062 5.13 39,531 2,142,878 5.42 28,921 1,856,148 6.42 27,818 2,119,398 7.62 Allowance for credit losses (638 ) (626 ) (574 ) (438 ) (409 ) Cash and due from banks 1,400 1,599 1,542 732 706 Other assets 5,255 5,344 4,850 2,720 2,727 Total assets $ 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 30,842 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities Interest bearing deposits NOW accounts $ 400 2,182 .55 550 1,802 .33 1,021 3,613 .35 761 3,900 .51 722 8,548 1.18 Savings deposits 14,889 139,445 .94 15,305 92,064 .60 13,278 102,190 .77 8,899 107,281 1.21 7,378 134,454 1.82 Time deposits 9,158 294,782 3.22 6,948 154,722 2.23 6,638 159,700 2.41 7,398 237,001 3.20 8,906 453,940 5.10 Deposits at foreign office 3,819 120,122 3.15 3,136 43,034 1.37 1,445 14,991 1.04 569 8,460 1.49 327 11,264 3.44 Total interest bearing deposits 28,266 556,531 1.97 25,939 291,622 1.12 22,382 280,494 1.25 17,627 356,642 2.02 17,333 608,206 3.51 Short term borrowings 4,890 157,853 3.23 5,142 71,172 1.38 4,331 49,064 1.13 3,125 52,723 1.69 3,280 124,810 3.81 Long term borrowings 6,411 279,967 4.37 5,832 201,366 3.45 6,018 198,252 3.29 4,162 185,149 4.45 3,538 210,581 5.95 Total interest bearing liabilities 39,567 994,351 2.51 36,913 564,160 1.53 32,731 527,810 1.61 24,914 594,514 2.39 24,151 943,597 3.91 Noninterest bearing deposits 8,050 8,039 6,801 3,618 3,327 Other liabilities 720 864 876 377 389 Total liabilities 48,337 45,816 40,408 28,909 27,867 Stockholders equity 5,798 5,701 4,941 3,026 2,975 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 30,842 Net interest spread 3.32 3.60 3.81 4.03 3.71 Contribution of interest free funds .45 .28 .28 .33 .52 Net interest income/margin on earning assets $ 1,811,654 3.77 % 1,751,902 3.88 % 1,615,068 4.09 % 1,261,634 4.36 % 1,175,801 4.23 % (a) Includes nonaccrual loans.

Average commercial real estate loans were $13.3 billion in 2004, 15% higher than $11.6 billion in 2003. Excluding the impact of the loans in the former Allfirst regions, average balances of outstanding commercial real estate loans grew $936 million in 2004 from 2003. Average consumer loans and leases totaled $11.2 billion during 2004, up 11% from $10.1 billion in the previous year, largely the result of growth in the automobile loan and home equity line of credit portfolios. The full year impact of Allfirst related loans and a $362 million increase in average automobile floor plan loans were the most significant contributors to higher average commercial loans and leases, which totaled $9.5 billion in 2004, 12% above 2003s average of $8.5 billion. Average residential real estate loans declined in 2004 due largely to customer repayments of loans and the full year impact of two separate securitization transactions totaling $1.3 billion of such loans during 2003s final quarter. In connection with the first 2003 securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $838 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $112 million in cash and retained approximately 87% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $1 million on the transaction which was included in other revenues from operations. In 2003s second securitization transaction and in a similar securitization transaction in 2005s final quarter, approximately $441 million and $126 million, respectively, of one to four family residential mortgage loans were converted to mortgage backed securities issued by FNMA. All of those mortgage backed securities were retained by the Company and, accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized. In each securitization, the retained securities were added to the Companys portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale. There were no comparable securitization transactions in 2004. In accordance with GAAP, the qualified special purpose trust related to the first 2003 mortgage loan securitization transaction is not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the resulting mortgage backed securities provide enhanced liquidity opportunities to the Company because the securities may be more readily pledged to secure borrowings or sold than the underlying loans could be. Additionally, under present regulatory risk based capital rules, the Company is generally required to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital when directly investing in residential real estate loans than when investing in government guaranteed or highly rated, privately placed mortgage backed securities. Additional information about these transactions and qualified special purpose trusts is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information about the Companys regulatory capital requirements is included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. 38 Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2005 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Of the $10.9 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the 2005 year end, approximately $9.0 billion, or 82%, were secured, while 47%, 26% and 13% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2005 aggregated $1.1 billion of which 39% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 10% secured by collateral in Maryland, and 13% secured by collateral in Pennsylvania. International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $217 million and $230 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under this program at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $200 million and $204 million, respectively. The Companys commercial aircraft lease portfolio totaled $59 million at December 31, 2005 and $82 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005 AIB was obligated to indemnify the Company for losses on approximately $32 million of those aircraft leases. The Company has decided not to pursue growing the commercial aircraft component of the lease portfolio. 39 Table 5 COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LEASES, NET OF UNEARNED DISCOUNT (Excluding Loans Secured by Real Estate) December 31, 2005 Percent of Dollars Outstanding by Loan Size Outstandings $0 1 $1 5 $5 10 $10 15 $15+ (Dollars in millions) New York State Secured $ 3,870 24 % 23 % 15 % 5 % 8 % Unsecured 875 5 7 3 2 Leases 429 4 3 1 Total New York State 5,174 33 % 33 % 19 % 7 % 8 % Pennsylvania Secured 2,273 28 % 24 % 15 % 6 % 9 % Unsecured 365 5 5 2 1 1 Leases 149 2 1 1 Total Pennsylvania 2,787 35 % 30 % 17 % 7 % 11 % Maryland Secured 972 29 % 20 % 8 % 4 % 6 % Unsecured 355 6 6 2 1 10 Leases 111 5 2 1 Total Maryland 1,438 40 % 28 % 11 % 5 % 16 % Other Secured 737 10 % 19 % 12 % 2 % 5 % Unsecured 365 9 5 3 7 Leases 419 6 9 6 5 2 Total other 1,521 25 % 33 % 21 % 7 % 14 % Total commercial loans and leases $ 10,920 33 % 31 % 18 % 7 % 11 % Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 60% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2005, compared with 58% in each of 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005, the Company held approximately $14.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $4.4 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $5.3 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $14.0 billion, $3.3 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004. A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction loans, adjustable rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 42% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2005. Table 6 presents commercial real estate 40 loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2005. Of the $4.6 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 34% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 41% by retail space and 10% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $15 million made up approximately 21% of the total.

Approximately 73% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 79% and 56%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 15% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2005. Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6 totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2005, or 4% of total loans and leases. Approximately 97% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2005 were $926 million of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes including the construction of office buildings, multi family residential housing, retail space and other commercial development. M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by FNMA and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one third of outstanding principal. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 approximately $941 million and $926 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $199 million and $61 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled $4.4 billion at December 31, 2005, including approximately 37% secured by properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 9% secured by properties located in Maryland. At December 31, 2005, $1.2 billion of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $790 million at December 31, 2004. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $583 million at December 31, 2005, or approximately 1% of total loans and leases, compared with $431 million or 1% at December 31, 2004. Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 27% of the average loan portfolio during 2005, compared with 30% in both 2004 and 2003. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 10% of average loans outstanding in 2005 and 2004. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 9% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2005, down from 12% in 2004. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2005. Approximately 55% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005 were secured by properties in New York State and 18% and 22% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit totaled $4.0 billion in 2005, 13% higher than $3.5 billion in 2004. The Company continues to pursue growing this portfolio, which has historically experienced a lower level of credit losses than other types of consumer loans. At December 31, 2005, 31% and 35% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal 42 underwriting and loan approval procedures. Since mid 2004, the Company has experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business, resulting from increased competition from other lenders, including financing incentives offered by automobile manufacturers. The Company chose not to match the pricing being offered by many competitors. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $137 million in 2005, $308 million in 2004 and $527 million in 2003. The Company ceased origination of automobile leases during 2003. The decision to cease origination of automobile leases did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, outstanding automobile leases totaled $85 million and $205 million, respectively. Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2005, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 47% of total loans and leases at the 2005 year end were to New York State customers, while 22% and 13% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively.

Average balances of investment securities were $8.5 billion in 2005, compared with $8.0 billion and $5.3 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was the result of net purchases in late 2004 and in 2005 consisting largely of collateralized residential mortgage obligations. The retention of mortgage backed securities related to securitizations of residential real estate loans added approximately $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $817 million to average investment securities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Also contributing to 2004s higher average balance were purchases of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations during the year. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and 43 preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company concluded that such declines were temporary in nature. As previously discussed, events occurring during 2005s third quarter resulted in the Company recognizing an other than temporary impairment charge of $29 million related to preferred securities of FNMA and FHLMC. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Money market assets are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks, interest earning trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Average money market assets were $113 million in 2005, $74 million in 2004 and $216 million in 2003. The amounts of investment securities and money market assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and money market assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. Core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the Company and are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Also included in core deposits are certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. Core deposits averaged $27.9 billion in 2005, $28.1 billion in 2004 and $25.8 billion in 2003. Core deposits assumed in connection with the Allfirst acquisition totaled approximately $10.7 billion on April 1, 2003. The rise in average balances of time deposits less than $100,000 in 2005 as compared with 2004 was due, in part, to higher interest rates, as customers shifted their funds from savings and non interest bearing deposit accounts to time deposits. Due to the historically low interest rate environment in 2003 and for much of 2004, the Company experienced a significant shift in the composition of core deposits in those years. Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average core savings and noninterest bearing deposits rose during those periods, while average time deposits under $100,000 decreased, exclusive of the impact of core deposits obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $216 million in 2005, $223 million in 2004 and $267 million in 2003. Funding provided by core deposits represented 58% of average earning assets in 2005, compared with 62% in 2004 and 65% in 2003. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2005 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Table 8 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2005 2004 to 2005 2003 to 2004 (Dollars in millions) NOW accounts $ 400 (27 )% (46 )% Savings deposits 14,827 (3 ) 15 Time deposits under $100,000 4,624 8 (10 ) Noninterest bearing deposits 8,050 18 Total $ 27,901 (1 )% 9 % 44 The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.8 billion in 2005, and $1.2 billion in each of 2004 and 2003. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $3.8 billion in 2005, $3.1 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. Average brokered time deposits totaled $2.7 billion in 2005, compared with $1.4 billion in 2004 and $643 million in 2003, and at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $3.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits at December 31, 2005 was 15 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $515 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts, which averaged $62 million, $57 million and $70 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Pittsburgh and Atlanta (together, the FHLB), and others as sources of funding. The average balance of short term borrowings was $4.9 billion in 2005, $5.1 billion in 2004 and $4.3 billion in 2003. Unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, included in short term borrowings averaged $4.1 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest component of short term borrowings and are obtained daily from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short term borrowings averaged $439 million in 2003, while there were no similar short term borrowings from the FHLB during 2005 or 2004. Also included in short term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Long term borrowings averaged $6.4 billion in 2005, $5.8 billion in 2004 and $6.0 billion in 2003. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $3.8 billion in 2005, $3.3 billion in 2004 and $3.9 billion in 2003, and subordinated capital notes of $1.3 billion in 2005 and 2004, and $1.2 billion in 2003. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for $409 million of subordinated notes bearing a fixed coupon rate of interest of 5.585% through December 27, 2015 and a variable rate of interest equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215% from December 28, 2015 to the maturity date of December 28, 2020. Beginning December 28, 2015, the Company may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the new notes on any interest payment date. In accordance with GAAP, the Company accounted for the exchange as a modification of debt terms and not as an extinguishment of debt because, among other factors, the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new subordinated notes was not at least ten percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original terms of the exchanged subordinated notes. Coincident with the exchange, the Company terminated $363 million out of a total notional amount of $500 million of interest rate swap agreements that were used to hedge the 8.0% subordinated notes. Under the terms of the swap agreements, the Company pays a variable rate of interest and receives a fixed rate. The Company paid $15 million to terminate the $363 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements. A hedge valuation adjustment of $15 million related to the $363 million of exchanged subordinated notes continues to be part of the carrying value of the new subordinated notes and will be amortized to interest expense over the period to expected maturity of the new notes. The new subordinated notes 45 have an effective rate of 7.76%. The $137 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement that was not terminated continues to hedge the remaining $137 million of 8.0% subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long term borrowings were $711 million and $710 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated debentures of M&T included in average long term borrowings in 2003 totaled $595 million. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as described herein, changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income. During 2005, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate eight times, each increase representing a 25 basis point increment over the previously effective target rate. Those interest rate increases resulted in a more rapid rise in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, most notably short term borrowings, than in the yields on earning assets, and contributed to a flattening of the yield curve. That flattening removed much of the differential between longer term interest rates and shorter term interest rates. The result of these conditions was a contraction of the net interest spread from 2004 to 2005. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, was 3.32% in 2005, down from 3.60% in 2004. The yield on earning assets during 2005 was 5.83%, up 70 basis points from 5.13% in 2004, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 98 basis points to 2.51% from 1.53% in 2004. The yield on the Companys earning assets decreased 29 basis points in 2004 from 5.42% in 2003, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2004 was down 8 basis points from 1.61%. During the period from June 30, 2004 through December 31, 2004, the Federal Reserve raised its federal funds target rate five times, in 25 basis point increments over the previously effective target rate. Lower rates earned on assets, including commercial real estate and automobile loans and investment securities, combined with short term liabilities that repriced more rapidly than many of the Companys variable rate earning assets, caused a contraction of the net interest spread from 2003 to 2004. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 3.81% in 2003 to 3.60% in 2004. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest free funds averaged $8.6 billion in 2005, compared with $8.3 billion in 2004 and $6.8 billion in 2003. The significant increase in such funds in 2004 as compared with 2003 was largely due to the full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition and growth in other noninterest bearing deposits. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.0 billion in 2005, $3.1 billion in 2004 and $2.7 billion in 2003. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.0 billion in 2005, $974 million in 2004 and $858 million in 2003. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was .45% in 2005, and .28% in both 2004 and 2003. The rise in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2005 as compared with 2004 and 2003 resulted largely from the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.77% in 2005, compared with 3.88% in 2004 and 4.09% in 2003. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin. In general, the Companys net interest margin has been declining since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in June 2004. Continued pressure on the Companys net interest margin is expected until the Federal Reserve slows or stops increasing interest rates. 46 Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 2005 was $652 million. Under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates. As of December 31, 2005, all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $9 million and $4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

Provision For Credit Losses The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. Reflecting continued improvement in 47 credit quality factors, the provision for credit losses was $88 million in 2005, down from $95 million in 2004 and $131 million in 2003. Net loan charge offs declined to $77 million in 2005 from $82 million and $97 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were ..19% in 2005, compared with .22% in 2004 and .28% in 2003. A summary of loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.

The lower level of 48 nonperforming loans at the 2005 year end as compared with a year earlier reflects an overall improvement in borrower repayment performance. In addition to a general improvement in repayment performance by borrowers, the sale of two large commercial loans during 2004 for cash equal to the $37 million carrying value of the loans contributed to the decrease in the amount of loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2004 as compared with December 31, 2003. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $129 million or .32% total loans and leases at December 31, 2005, compared with $155 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003, representing .40% and .43% of total loans and leases at those respective dates. Those loans included $106 million, $121 million and $125 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government related entities. Such guaranteed loans included one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with them, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government related entities and totaled $79 million at December 31, 2005, $104 million at December 31, 2004 and $122 million at December 31, 2003. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export Import Bank of the United States that totaled $26 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $17 million and $1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.

Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Commercial loans and leases charged off during 2005, net of recoveries, were $26 million, compared with $20 million in 2004 and $32 million in 2003. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases aggregated $39 million at December 31, 2005, $45 million a year earlier and $105 million at December 31, 2003. As noted earlier, the decreases in such loans largely reflect improvement in the repayment performance of borrowers. Net recoveries of commercial real estate loans during 2005 totaled $1 million, compared with net charge offs in 2004 and 2003 of $3 million and $6 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming totaled $44 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $45 million at December 31, 2004 and $48 million at December 31, 2003. Net charge offs of residential real estate loans during 2005 were $2 million, compared with $4 million in 2004 and $5 million in 2003. Nonperforming residential real estate loans at 2005s year end totaled $29 million, compared with $44 million and $51 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $96 million, $127 million and $141 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As already noted, a substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government related entities. During 2005, net charge offs of consumer loans and leases totaled $50 million, representing .47% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $55 million or ..49% in 2004 and $54 million or .53% in 2003. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Charge offs of indirect automobile loans and leases during each of 2005 and 2004, net of recoveries, were $37 million, and in 2003 were $32 million. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases were $44 million at December 31, 2005, representing .42% of outstanding consumer loans and leases, compared with $38 million or ..35% at December 31, 2004 and $36 million or .33% at December 31, 2003. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $1 million at December 31, 2005, $2 million at December 31, 2004 and $3 million at December 31, 2003. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2005 in light of (i) the sluggish pace of economic growth in many of the markets served by the Company; (ii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central 50 Pennsylvania; and (iii) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies. Although the 2006 economic outlook predicts moderate national growth with inflation expected to be reasonably well contained, concerns exist about higher energy prices; a waning housing boom; Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans resulting from rising interest rates; sluggish job creation, which could cause consumer spending to slow; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and sluggish commercial loan demand in many market areas served by the Company. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following paragraphs describe these components. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all commercial and commercial real estate loans which are in nonaccrual status. Specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national and local economic conditions and trends; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective 51 determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically the western and central portions of New York State and Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (iv) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; (v) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans; and (vi) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2005. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market was 0.6%, or one third the national average. The manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company also lagged the national average. In contrast, job growth was higher than the national average in the Hudson Valley region of New York State (1.8%), Maryland (2.4%) and Northern Virginia (4.0%) in 2005. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness, high energy prices, weak population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions that lagged national population growth trends and other factors, continue to indicate an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York and Pennsylvania where more than two thirds of its lending business is conducted. A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in table 12. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $93 million at December 31, 2005 and $106 million at December 31, 2004. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $15 million at December 31, 2005 and $17 million at December 31, 2004. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .51% and .42% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses from the end of 2004 to December 31, 2005 was largely attributable to the factors described herein, including the significantly poorer economic environment and performance in many of the major market regions served by the Company, the uncertain impact that significantly higher interest rates and energy prices were having on the economy, in general, and on borrowers abilities to repay loans, and managements lack of familiarity and long term experience evaluating the impact of changing economic conditions on the performance of borrowers located in market areas entered through the Allfirst acquisition. Given the prolonged underperformance of the economies of many of the regions served by the Company over a number of years and the significant size of the loan portfolio in the Companys new market regions entered through the Allfirst acquisition, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit 52 losses. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Table 12 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES December 31 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. $ 136,852 $ 147,550 $ 186,902 $ 120,627 $ 130,156 Real estate 161,003 166,910 170,493 152,758 139,848 Consumer 133,541 148,591 152,759 113,711 94,710 Unallocated 206,267 163,813 103,904 49,376 60,294 Total $ 637,663 $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 As a percentage of gross loans and leases outstanding Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 1.23 % 1.45 % 1.99 % 2.23 % 2.50 % Real estate .85 .96 1.10 1.17 1.00 Consumer 1.27 1.33 1.37 1.51 1.52 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2005 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $638 million or 1.58% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2005, compared with $627 million or 1.63% at December 31, 2004 and $614 million or 1.72% at December 31, 2003. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases since the 2003 year end reflects continued improvement in certain credit factors, including the already discussed decreases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses reflect sustained positive trends and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios decline, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans will decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 408%, 364% and 256%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows a consistent methodology as described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality: For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 10 basis point increase in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. 53 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were: For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5 basis point decrease in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $45 million in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $14 million reduction in such losses could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties and properties used in providing retail goods and services in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% and 5%, respectively, of loans outstanding at December 31, 2005. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2005. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $217 million at December 31, 2005, or .5% of total loans and leases. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $9 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $13 million and $20 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other Income Other income totaled $950 million in 2005, compared with $943 million in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues were offset by losses from investment securities, which reflect the already discussed $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to the Companys investment in certain preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, other income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Other income in 2004 increased 13% from the $831 million earned in 2003. The rise in such income in 2004 over the prior year was attributable to the full year impact of revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Excluding Allfirst related revenues, higher levels of service charges on deposit accounts, letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related sales commissions and other revenues were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues. Mortgage banking revenues were $136 million in 2005, compared with $124 million in 2004 and $149 million in 2003. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities are largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program. Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, rose 7% to $107 million in 2005 from $100 million in 2004. Higher origination activity in 2005 as compared with 2004 was the most significant factor contributing to the increase in revenues. Residential mortgage banking revenues in 2004 were 23% lower than the $129 million earned in 2003, primarily due to lower levels of loan originations. Also contributing to 2004s decreased revenues was the adoption of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. In March 2004, the SEC issued SAB No. 105, which provides guidance regarding the accounting for loans held for sale and loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. In accordance with SAB No. 105, effective April 1, 2004, value ascribable to loan cash flows that will ultimately be realized in connection with mortgage servicing activities should not be included in the determination of fair value of loans held for sale or commitments to originate loans for sale, but rather should only be recognized at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold. The Companys adoption of the SEC guidance resulted in a deferral of mortgage banking revenues of approximately $6 million in 2004 as 54 compared with 2003. Neither the amount or timing of receipt of cash flows nor the economic value of the loans and commitments were changed as a result of this accounting guidance. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $7.7 billion in 2005, compared with $4.8 billion in 2004 and $5.9 billion in 2003. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $42 million in 2005, up from $32 million in 2004, but down from $65 million in 2003. On May 1, 2005, M&T Mortgage Corporation assumed the operations of Regions Financial Corporations wholesale residential mortgage business. Those operations added 13 locations and approximately 140 employees to M&T Mortgage Corporations business. Approximately $1.7 billion of residential mortgage loans originated in 2005 for sale to other investors were related to the assumed operations. Nevertheless, including the effect of expenses, the operations assumed did not have a material impact on the Companys net income during 2005. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others increased to $58 million in 2005 from $57 million in 2004 and $54 million in 2003. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $10 million, $6 million and $5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $15.6 billion at December 31, 2005, $14.9 billion a year earlier and $13.6 billion at December 31, 2003, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $2.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $140 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $133 million and $129 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $23 million, $13 million and $8 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre determined rates were $923 million and $352 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, $764 million and $422 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $824 million and $459 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Net unrealized losses on residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $5 million at December 31, 2005, compared with net unrealized gains of $3 million and $7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net decreases in revenue of $8 million in 2005, $4 million in 2004 (reflecting a $6 million decrease attributable to the implementation of SAB No. 105) and $8 million in 2003. Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $29 million in 2005, compared with $25 million and $20 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $14 million in 2005, compared with $13 million during each of 2004 and 2003. Loan servicing revenues increased to $15 million in 2005 from $12 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets totaled $21 million at December 31, 2005 and $22 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $4.3 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and included $941 million, $926 million and $825 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $241 million and $42 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, $167 million and $106 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $72 million and $71 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $199 million, $61 million and $1 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $370 million in 2005, compared with $366 million in 2004. Higher consumer service charges, largely resulting from higher debit card transaction volumes 55 and overdraft fees, were partially offset by lower commercial service charges. Deposit account service charges in 2004 were 18% higher than $310 million in 2003. Approximately 80% of that year over year increase was in regions associated with Allfirst and was largely due to the full year impact of that transaction. Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income aggregated $135 million in 2005, down slightly from $136 million a year earlier. The impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds caused the decline in revenues from 2004 to 2005. Trust income grew 19% in 2004 from $115 million in 2003 due to the full year impact of the Allfirst transaction. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, were $134.0 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $128.4 billion at December 31, 2004. Trust assets under management totaled $21.6 billion and $22.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $56 million in 2005, 3% higher than $54 million in 2004 due largely to higher revenues earned from the sale of mutual funds. Brokerage services income was $51 million in 2003. The increase from 2003 to 2004 was the result of revenues earned in the former Allfirst regions. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $23 million in 2005, $19 million in 2004 and $16 million in 2003. The higher gains in 2005 and 2004 as compared with 2003 were due in part to increased volumes of trading assets and liabilities and reflect fees and market value changes related to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $15 million, $11 million and $7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $41 million and $40 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of such assets were $3 million in 2005, $4 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in deferred compensation liabilities is included in other costs of operations. As a result of the previously described charge for the other than temporary impairment in value of the FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock, losses on investment securities aggregated $28 million during 2005, compared with gains of $3 million and $2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other revenues from operations rose to $259 million in 2005 from $240 million in 2004 and $188 million in 2003. A $5 million increase in revenues from providing corporate financing advisory services and a $7 million increase in gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property contributed to the higher revenues in 2005 as compared with 2004. The increase from 2003 to 2004 was largely due to the full year impact of revenues associated with the Allfirst transaction. Higher letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related sales commissions and other revenues also contributed to the increase from 2003 to 2004. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit related fees totaled $75 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $47 million, $48 million and $45 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $30 million in 2005, $28 million in 2004 and $26 million in 2003. Insurance related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $22 million in each of 2005 and 2004, compared with $18 million in 2003. ATM usage fees aggregated $22 million in 2005 and in 2004, compared with $19 million in 2003. 56 Other Expense Other expense decreased 2% to $1.49 billion in 2005 from $1.52 billion in 2004. In 2003, other expense totaled $1.45 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $57 million, $75 million and $78 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and merger related expenses of $60 million in 2003. There were no merger related expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.43 billion in 2005, down 1% from $1.44 billion in 2004. Included in 2004s operating expenses was the $25 million charitable contribution already discussed. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1% from 2004. That increase from 2004 resulted from higher costs of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and increased professional services expenses, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.31 billion in 2003. A significant portion of the increase in noninterest expense in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related expenses in 2004 compared with nine months of similar expenses in 2003, and to the $25 million charitable contribution made in 2004. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense and a summary of 2003s merger related expenses. Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $822 million in 2005, 2% higher than $807 million in 2004. Expenses related to providing employee health care and retirement benefits were the most significant contributors to the rise in salaries and benefits from 2004 to 2005. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $740 million in 2003. The full year impact of expenses related to the acquired operations of Allfirst was the leading contributor to the rise in salaries and employee benefits costs in 2004 as compared with 2003. The Company recognizes expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting for all stock based compensation granted to employees after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included $45 million, $48 million and $43 million, respectively, of stock based compensation. The number of full time equivalent employees was 12,780 at December 31, 2005, compared with 12,678 and 13,305 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pension benefit expense is a significant cost to the Company and totaled $38 million in 2005, $30 million in 2004 and $24 million in 2003. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. These assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of these assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment. The Companys 2005 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long term rate of return on assets of 8.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.90%; and a discount rate of 6.00%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on 57 plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $1 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $4 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance promulgated in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, reflects the long term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $155 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $5 million in 2005 and $2 million in each of 2004 and 2003. Reflecting declines in the discount rate used to value pension plan obligations from 6.25% at December 31, 2003 to 6.00% at December 31, 2004 and 5.50% at December 31, 2005, the accumulated benefit obligation of certain of the Companys pension plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $208 million at December 31, 2005 and $116 million at December 31, 2004. The lower discount rate resulted from declines in market rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period for payment of pension benefits. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, the Company was required to have a recorded pension liability for those plans that was at least equal to $208 million at December 31, 2005 and $116 million at December 31, 2004. As a result, as of December 31, 2005 the Company increased its previously recorded pension liability by $60 million with a corresponding reduction of other comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $37 million. A combination of lower than expected investment returns on plan assets during 2005 and a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate assumption to 5.50% were the significant factors contributing to the need for an additional charge to other comprehensive income in 2005. A further 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2005 to 5.25% would have resulted in increases in the accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations of all pension plans of an additional $23 million. Under that scenario, the incremental minimum pension liability adjustment in 2005 would have been $83 million rather than the $60 million that was actually recorded, and the additional after tax effect charge to other comprehensive income in 2005 would have been $51 million. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 5.75% would have decreased the accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations of all pension plans by $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the incremental minimum pension liability adjustment in 2005 would have been $36 million rather than the $60 million actually recorded and the additional after tax effect charge to other comprehensive income in 2005 would have been $22 million rather than $37 million. The Company did not make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2004 or 2005. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a career average pay formula as opposed to the previous final average pay formula. The amendments affect benefits earned for service periods beginning after December 31, 2005. Active participants had the choice of electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined contribution pension plan, the Company will make contributions to the plan each year in an 58 amount that is based on an individual participants total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants will not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. New employees will not be eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but will participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million. There was no effect on the accumulated benefit obligation. The financial impact from these changes to the results of operations for 2005 was not material. In addition to the changes described above, the Company also amended its retirement savings plan (RSP), effective January 1, 2006. The RSP is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 15% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. The RSP was amended to allow eligible employees to defer up to 50% of total compensation as defined above in connection with the defined contribution pension plan. RSP expense totaled $17 million in 2005, $16 million in 2004 and $15 million in 2003. As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined contribution pension plan, the Company hopes to limit increases in future period expenses associated with these plans. Reflecting the impact of these changes, the Company projects that expenses in 2006 associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP will not be materially different than the aggregate amount of expense recognized in 2005 for the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP. Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses aggregated $606 million in 2005, 4% below $634 million in 2004. Excluding the previously mentioned $25 million charitable contribution in 2004, nonpersonnel operating expenses decreased $3 million from 2004. As compared with 2004, a $7 million higher reversal in 2005 of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, and lower equipment, net occupancy and other operating expenses were partially offset by higher professional services costs. The higher expenses incurred for professional services in 2005 were due in part to several initiatives of the Company, including projects focusing on procurement practices, consolidation of loan application systems, revenue enhancement opportunities and operational efficiencies, as well as costs related to the already discussed subordinated note exchange. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $578 million in 2003. The full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition was a significant contributor to the higher expense levels during 2004 as compared with 2003, when only nine months of Allfirst related operating expenses were incurred. Also contributing to that increase in expenses in 2004 was the $25 million charitable contribution and higher expenses for amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and professional services. Partially offsetting those higher expenses were lower charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. In 2004, a $4 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was recognized, while in 2003 a provision for impairment of $2 million was recorded. Those adjustments to the valuation allowance resulted from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflect the impact of changing interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan prepayments. Information about the assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the estimated impact of changes in those assumptions are included in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $389 million in 2005, compared with $344 million in 2004 and $277 million in 2003. The effective tax rates were 33.2%, 32.3% and 32.5% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 was largely due to the impact of the third quarter 2004 reorganization of two of the Companys subsidiaries that altered the taxable status of such subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions thereby decreasing the Companys effective state income tax rate for 2004. As a result of the reorganizations, both income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2004 were reduced by $12 million. The effective tax rate in future 59 periods will be affected by the results of operations attributable to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates and any changes in income tax regulations or interpretations of such regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $230 million at December 31, 2005 and $248 million at December 31, 2004. Such assets included $217 million and $230 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. The most significant funding source for the Company has historically been core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 57% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2005, compared with 59% and 67% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLB and others. M&T Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $6.4 billion at December 31, 2005. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York totaling approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2005 or 2004. The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital notes to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes with a par value of $409 million due 2020. The new notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at M&Ts option, subject to regulatory approval. No new funding was received as a result of the exchange. A more detailed description of the exchange is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/ Lending and Funding Activities and in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, in anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to provide liquidity to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately 60 $572 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings aggregated $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. Offshore branch deposits have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings, as noted earlier, and such deposits outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 totaled $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, and generally matured on the next business day. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 13. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time to time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $58 million and $14 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds. 61 Table 14 MATURITY DISTRIBUTION OF SELECTED LOANS(a) December 31, 2005 Demand 2006 2007 2010 After 2010 (In thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. $ 5,180,326 $ 1,069,356 $ 3,002,783 $ 526,935 Real estate construction 232,509 1,348,799 670,325 78,908 Total $ 5,412,835 $ 2,418,155 $ 3,673,108 $ 605,843 Floating or adjustable interest rates $ 2,900,198 $ 418,606 Fixed or predetermined interest rates 772,910 187,237 Total $ 3,673,108 $ 605,843 (a) The data do not include nonaccrual loans. The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2005 are summarized in table 15. Liquidity may be affected by off balance sheet commitments to customers, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2005 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments. 62 Table 15 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS Less Than One One to Three Three to Five Over Five December 31, 2005 Year Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Payments due for contractual obligations Time deposits $ 8,131,857 $ 2,836,849 $ 287,729 $ 151,191 $ 11,407,626 Deposits at foreign office 2,809,532 2,809,532 Federal funds purchased and agreements to repurchase securities 4,211,978 4,211,978 Other short term borrowings 940,894 940,894 Long term borrowings 611,273 2,827,927 922,778 1,835,016 6,196,994 Operating leases 45,971 81,505 55,392 96,346 279,214 Other 25,591 13,858 10,302 41,050 90,801 Total $ 16,777,096 $ 5,760,139 $ 1,276,201 $ 2,123,603 $ 25,937,039 Other commitments Commitments to extend credit $ 6,527,471 $ 3,313,413 $ 3,794,994 $ 1,602,506 $ 15,238,384 Standby letters of credit 1,386,169 1,330,319 673,836 132,910 3,523,234 Commercial letters of credit 21,360 5,056 20,944 47,360 Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts 134,632 71,265 93,526 886,962 1,186,385 Commitments to sell real estate loans 1,164,360 1,164,360 Total $ 9,233,992 $ 4,720,053 $ 4,583,300 $ 2,622,378 $ 21,159,723 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2005 approximately $528 million was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2004. 63 On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not currently anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.

The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and non parallel shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $652 million. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. Management has taken actions, when deemed prudent, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 65 Table 18 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. Table 18 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES Calculated Increase (Decrease) in Projected Net Interest Income December 31 Changes in Interest Rates 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) +200 basis points $ (7,178 ) $ (20,848 ) +100 basis points (4,096 ) (8,228 ) 100 basis points (5,733 ) 12,386 200 basis points (16,184 ) 4,900 The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. 66 Table 19 CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA Three Months Four to One to After December 31, 2005 or Less Twelve Months Five Years Five Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Loans and leases, net $ 20,392,807 $ 3,594,829 $ 9,692,421 $ 6,650,588 $ 40,330,645 Money market assets 120,586 700 150 121,436 Investment securities 3,756,845 859,831 1,220,223 2,563,265 8,400,164 Total earning assets 24,270,238 4,455,360 10,912,794 9,213,853 48,852,245 NOW accounts 901,938 901,938 Savings deposits 13,839,150 13,839,150 Time deposits 5,525,813 4,336,397 1,492,526 52,890 11,407,626 Deposits at foreign office 2,808,216 1,316 2,809,532 Total interest bearing deposits 23,075,117 4,337,713 1,492,526 52,890 28,958,246 Short term borrowings 5,152,872 5,152,872 Long term borrowings 3,275,266 58,867 1,448,731 1,414,130 6,196,994 Total interest bearing liabilities 31,503,255 4,396,580 2,941,257 1,467,020 40,308,112 Interest rate swaps (602,241 ) 405,000 20,000 177,241 Periodic gap $ (7,835,258 ) $ 463,780 $ 7,991,537 $ 7,924,074 Cumulative gap (7,835,258 ) (7,371,478 ) 620,059 8,544,133 Cumulative gap as a % of total earning assets (16.0 )% (15.1 )% 1.3 % 17.5 % The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities. The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $6.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $679 million and $512 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $192 million and $77 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $160 million and $94 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $41 million and $40 million, respectively, related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading 67 account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $48 million and $49 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2005 was $5.9 billion or 10.66% of total assets, compared with $5.7 billion or 10.82% at December 31, 2004 and $5.7 billion or 11.47% at December 31, 2003. On a per share basis, stockholders equity was $52.39 at the 2005 year end, 5% higher than $49.68 at December 31, 2004 and 10% above $47.55 at December 31, 2003. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $25.91 at December 31, 2005, compared with $23.62 and $21.97 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented in table 2. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.71%, 11.07% and 10.89% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. To complete the acquisition of Allfirst on April 1, 2003, M&T issued 26,700,000 shares of common stock to AIB resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $2.0 billion. The value ascribed to the common shares issued to AIB was based on the market value of M&T common stock at the time the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and AIB. Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges; and minimum pension liability adjustments. Net unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities were $49 million, or $.43 per common share, at December 31, 2005, compared with losses of $5 million, or $.04 per common share, at December 31, 2004 and gains of $38 million, or $.32 per common share, at December 31, 2003. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003. The minimum pension liability adjustment, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $49 million at December 31, 2005 and by $12 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003, or by $.44 per share, $.11 per share and $.10 per share on those respective dates. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Cash dividends paid in 2005 on M&Ts common stock aggregated $199 million, compared with $188 million and $135 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in 2004s first quarter from $.30 per share to $.40 per share, and again in the second quarter of 2005 to $.45 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $1.75 in 2005, up 9% from $1.60 in 2004 and 46% higher than $1.20 in 2003. M&T repurchased 4,891,800 shares of its common stock in 2005 and 6,520,800 shares in 2004, at a cost of $510 million and $610 million, respectively. M&T did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2003, determining instead that it would use the Companys internal generation of capital to support the acquisition of Allfirst. In December 2004, M&T had announced a plan to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. That repurchase plan was completed in December 2005. In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up 68 to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2005, M&T had repurchased a total of 44,700 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $110.36 per share. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2005, core capital included $688 million of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $963 million of subordinated capital notes. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes due 2020. The new notes bear interest at a fixed coupon rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at M&Ts option, subject to regulatory approval. The subordinated note exchange was done primarily to allow preferential regulatory capital treatment for the new notes, as the 8.0% notes due 2010 would not completely qualify as Tier II capital due to limitations when subordinated notes are within five years of maturity. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after tax effect of merger related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 18.50% in 2005, 18.12% in 2004 and 23.35% in 2003. Fourth Quarter Results Net income rose 7% to $205 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 from $192 million in the corresponding quarter of 2004. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.78 and $1.82, respectively, in 2005s final quarter, compared with $1.62 and $1.66, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2004. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2005 were 1.48% and 13.85%, respectively, compared with 1.45% and 13.37%, respectively, in the year earlier period. Net operating income increased to $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 5% from $202 million in 2004s final quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share rose 9% to $1.85 in the recently completed quarter from $1.70 in the fourth quarter of 2004. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.63% and 29.12%, respectively, in the final quarter of 2005, compared with 1.62% and 29.69%, respectively, in the year earlier quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) and $10 million ($.08 per diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2005 and 2004 are provided in table 21. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 2% to $454 million in the recent quarter from $446 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. That growth was the result of a 5% increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $48.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $46.5 billion in the year earlier period. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $40.4 billion, 6% higher than $38.1 billion during 2004s final quarter. A $1.5 billion rise in residential real estate loans, including a $1.0 billion increase in residential real estate loans held for sale, and an $819 million rise in commercial loans were the leading contributors to the growth in average loans outstanding. The yield on earning assets was 6.16% in the last quarter of 2005, up 92 basis points from 5.24% in the fourth quarter of 2004. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 2.98% in the fourth quarter of 2005, 123 basis points higher than 1.75% in the similar period in 2004. The resulting net interest spread was 3.18% in 2005s final quarter, down 31 basis points from 3.49% in the fourth quarter of 2004. That decline reflects the impact of rising short term interest rates in 2005 that increased rates on interest 69 bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earning assets and resulted in a flattening of the yield curve. As a result, the Companys net interest margin declined to 3.69% in the recent quarter from 3.82% in the final quarter of 2004. The provision for credit losses was $23 million during the final three months of 2005, down from $28 million in the year earlier period. Net charge offs of loans were $23 million in 2005s fourth quarter, representing an annualized .22% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $27 million or .29% during the similar 2004 quarter. Other income totaled $249 million in 2005s final quarter, 5% higher than $238 million in the year earlier quarter. Higher mortgage banking revenues and corporate financing advisory fees contributed to that increase. Other expense in the final three months of 2005 increased 2% to $369 million from $362 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in such amounts are expenses considered nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $13 million and $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were up 3%, totaling $356 million in the recently completed quarter, compared with $346 million in 2004s final quarter. Higher costs for employee benefits and professional services were the leading contributors to that increase, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Operating expenses in the final quarter of 2005 reflect a $6 million reduction in expense resulting from a partial reversal of that valuation allowance, compared with a $222 thousand reduction of such valuation allowance in 2004s fourth quarter. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 was 50.7% and 50.6%, respectively. Table 21 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004. Segment Information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment contributed net income of $219 million in 2005, up 3% from $213 million in 2004. The favorable performance was due mainly to an increase in net interest income of $21 million, largely the result of a 7% increase in loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a $9 million increase in noninterest expenses, due predominantly to higher personnel costs. Net income for this segment totaled $170 million in 2003. The rise in net income in 2004 as compared with 2003 was attributable to higher net interest income of $46 million, service charges on deposit accounts of $9 million, and letter of credit and other credit related fees of $17 million. Included in that growth was the full year impact of the acquired Allfirst related operations in 2004, while 2003 70 included only nine months of such operating results. Higher average loan balances in non Allfirst regions and a $12 million decline in net charge offs also contributed to the higher net income in 2004 as compared with 2003. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were higher salaries, benefits and other noninterest expenses of $32 million, also largely attributable to the full year impact of Allfirst in 2004. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Commercial Real Estate segment contributed $143 million to net income, up 13% from the $126 million earned in 2004. The improvement was due to an increase in net interest income of $19 million that resulted from higher average loan balances and a wider margin associated with deposits, a $4 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues and a lower provision for credit losses of $5 million. Net income in 2004 for the Commercial Real Estate segment was 11% above the $114 million earned in 2003. The improvement was due to higher net interest income of $20 million, primarily due to higher loan balances outstanding of $608 million, or 9%, largely the result of growth in the markets already served by the Company and also reflecting the full year impact of balances obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Also contributing to the improved performance were higher commercial mortgage banking revenues of $5 million and increased letter of credit and other credit related fees. The higher revenues were offset, in part, by a $13 million increase in noninterest expenses, largely the result of the full year impact of salaries, benefits and other noninterest expenses related to the business obtained from Allfirst. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC owned by the Company. As previously mentioned, included in the 2005 results was a $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to those preferred stock issuances. As a result, this segments net income of $93 million in 2005 was down 17% from $112 million in 2004. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $82 million in 2003. The 36% increase in net income from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to a $40 million increase in net interest income resulting from higher average earning assets. The primary contributor to those higher earning assets was growth in the investment securities portfolio, due largely to purchases of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations during 2004 and the full year impact of the retention of mortgage backed securities related to the fourth quarter 2003 securitization of $1.2 billion of residential real estate loans. Also contributing to the favorable performance was a $2 million partial reversal during 2004 of a valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, compared with a $2 million addition to such allowance in 2003. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the southern and western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segments net income increased by 50% to $43 million in 2005 from $29 million in 2004. That improvement was due predominantly to higher noninterest revenues of $20 million, resulting from loan origination, sales and servicing activities, and higher net interest income of $10 million, attributable primarily to an increase in average loan balances outstanding. As mentioned 71 earlier, in May 2005 M&T Mortgage Corporation assumed the operations of Regions Financial Corporations wholesale residential mortgage business. Those operations added 13 locations and approximately 140 employees to M&T Mortgage Corporations business. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors relating to the assumed operations aggregated approximately $1.7 billion in 2005. Including the effect of expenses, the operations assumed did not have a material impact on net income. Also contributing to the segments improved performance was the effect of an $8 million partial reversal of the capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance recognized during 2005, compared with a $2 million partial reversal of such allowance recognized during 2004. Partially offsetting revenue growth was a $14 million increase in salaries and benefits expenses. Net income in 2004 for this segment was 57% lower than the $67 million earned in 2003. This unfavorable variance reflects a $75 million decrease in revenues, due primarily to a lower level of loan originations in 2004 as compared with 2003. The higher origination activity in 2003 reflected the impact of historically low levels of interest rates during that year that produced a favorable environment for consumers to participate in origination and refinancing activities. Also contributing to the decline in revenues was the previously noted $6 million impact of the adoption of SAB No. 105. Partially offsetting the decline in revenues was a $9 million decrease in salaries and benefits expenses reflecting the lower loan originations in 2004. Gains from the sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $10 million, $9 million, and $22 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels which include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $325 million in 2005, up 30% from $251 in 2004. The favorable performance was due mainly to increases in net interest income of $81 million, driven largely by an increase in net interest margin attributable to deposit products. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $21 million, lower noninterest expenses of $13 million, and a $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses also contributed to the rise in net income. In 2003, the Retail Banking segment contributed net income of $206 million. The 22% increase from 2003 to 2004 was due largely to increases in net interest income of $59 million and service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $54 million, offset, in part, by higher expenses of $51 million, all substantially related to the acquired Allfirst franchise. A $14 million decline in the provision for credit losses, due to slower growth in indirect automobile loan balances, also contributed to the rise in net income. The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses, and, in 2003, merger related expenses resulting from the Allfirst acquisition. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $41 million, $9 million, and $66 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The higher net loss incurred during 2005 as compared with 2004 resulted largely from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. Noninterest expenses in 2004 were $44 million higher than in 2005, reflecting 2004s $25 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation and a $19 million higher charge for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The 2004 net loss also reflected the $12 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the 72 reorganization of certain of M&Ts subsidiaries. The lower net loss in 2004 as compared with 2003 was largely the result of merger related costs of $60 million in 2003 and the net impact of higher noninterest income and expense in 2004 due to the full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition. Recent Accounting Developments In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), an amendment of SFAS No. 123 which supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123R also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Additionally, in March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107. SAB No. 107 expresses the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies and the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations. SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual reporting periods that begin after June 15, 2005. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began recognizing expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in SFAS No. 123. Using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, financial information for prior periods was restated to reflect the impact of recognizing expense for stock based compensation in those years as well. As required, coincident with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company will begin accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and employees who will become retirement eligible prior to full vesting of the award because the Companys incentive compensation plan allows for vesting at the time an employee retires. Through December 31, 2005, stock based compensation granted to such individuals was expensed over the normal vesting period and any remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized at the time an individual employee actually retired. This change will affect the timing of stock based compensation expense recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2006 and each first quarter thereafter as most of the Companys stock based awards are granted in January, but will not affect the fair value of stock based compensation granted to employees nor the aggregate amount of stock based compensation expense recognized by the Company. Had M&T recognized compensation costs under the new approach in 2005, the effect would not have been material to the consolidated financial statements for that year. The Company estimates the impact of such change will be to increase salaries and employee benefits expense by approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2006 and by approximately $4 million for the year ending December 31, 2006, as compared to what otherwise would have been recognized had the expense recognition not been accelerated. If not for this required change, the estimated $4 million of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in 2006 would have been recognized in 2007 through 2009 following the normal vesting schedule for stock options granted by the Company. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of the Companys Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements. 73 Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations and credit losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi year contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Companys future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger and acquisition activities compared with the Companys expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which the Company conducts business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors. 74 Table 20 QUARTERLY TRENDS 2005 Quarters 2004 Quarters Fourth Third Second First Fourth Third Second First Earnings and dividends Amounts in thousands, except per share Interest income (taxable equivalent basis) $ 757,654 $ 725,129 $ 680,781 $ 642,441 $ 613,012 $ 587,598 $ 565,090 $ 550,362 Interest expense 303,493 265,576 229,016 196,266 166,755 143,771 126,805 126,829 Net interest income 454,161 459,553 451,765 446,175 446,257 443,827 438,285 423,533 Less: provision for credit losses 23,000 22,000 19,000 24,000 28,000 17,000 30,000 20,000 Other income 248,604 221,494 245,362 234,258 237,559 244,925 232,334 228,151 Less: other expense 369,114 368,250 380,441 367,337 361,922 406,922 357,207 389,967 Income before income taxes 310,651 290,797 297,686 289,096 293,894 264,830 283,412 241,717 Applicable income taxes 101,113 95,348 96,589 95,686 97,624 73,843 94,538 77,997 Taxable equivalent adjustment 4,553 4,375 4,263 4,120 4,065 4,546 4,489 4,230 Net income $ 204,985 $ 191,074 $ 196,834 $ 189,290 $ 192,205 $ 186,441 $ 184,385 $ 159,490 Per common share data Basic earnings $ 1.82 $ 1.68 $ 1.73 $ 1.65 $ 1.66 $ 1.59 $ 1.56 $ 1.33 Diluted earnings 1.78 1.64 1.69 1.62 1.62 1.56 1.53 1.30 Cash dividends $ .45 $ .45 $ .45 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 Average common shares outstanding Basic 112,529 113,530 113,949 114,773 115,953 116,897 118,224 119,738 Diluted 115,147 116,200 116,422 117,184 119,010 119,665 120,655 122,316 Performance ratios, annualized Return on Average assets 1.48 % 1.39 % 1.46 % 1.44 % 1.45 % 1.42 % 1.45 % 1.29 % Average common stockholders equity 13.85 % 12.97 % 13.73 % 13.41 % 13.37 % 13.02 % 13.12 % 11.19 % Net interest margin on average earning assets (taxable equivalent basis) 3.69 % 3.76 % 3.78 % 3.83 % 3.82 % 3.85 % 3.92 % 3.92 % Nonperforming loans to total loans and leases, net of unearned discount .39 % .41 % .46 % .46 % .45 % .48 % .51 % .70 % Efficiency ratio(a) 52.49 % 51.94 % 54.58 % 54.00 % 52.95 % 59.08 % 53.27 % 60.07 % Net operating (tangible) results(b) Net operating income (in thousands) $ 212,738 $ 199,577 $ 205,415 $ 199,135 $ 202,215 $ 197,822 $ 196,158 $ 172,423 Diluted net operating income per common share 1.85 1.72 1.76 1.70 1.70 1.65 1.63 1.41 Annualized return on Average tangible assets 1.63 % 1.54 % 1.62 % 1.61 % 1.62 % 1.60 % 1.64 % 1.48 % Average tangible common stockholders equity 29.12 % 27.67 % 29.88 % 29.67 % 29.69 % 29.42 % 30.12 % 26.02 % Efficiency ratio(a) 50.69 % 49.97 % 52.56 % 51.63 % 50.56 % 56.38 % 50.39 % 56.81 % Balance sheet data In millions, except per share Average balances Total assets(c) $ 54,835 $ 54,444 $ 53,935 $ 53,306 $ 52,725 $ 52,170 $ 51,251 $ 49,915 Total tangible assets(c) 51,860 51,461 50,944 50,305 49,647 49,075 48,137 46,781 Earning assets 48,833 48,447 47,931 47,240 46,535 45,874 44,923 43,444 Investment securities 8,302 8,439 8,593 8,573 8,326 8,195 7,943 7,516 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 40,403 39,879 39,229 38,580 38,142 37,611 36,904 35,843 Deposits 37,006 36,708 36,245 35,282 34,768 34,569 33,702 32,856 Stockholders equity(c) 5,873 5,845 5,749 5,723 5,721 5,697 5,654 5,732 Tangible stockholders equity(c) 2,898 2,862 2,758 2,722 2,710 2,675 2,619 2,665 At end of quarter Total assets(c) $ 55,146 $ 54,841 $ 54,482 $ 53,887 $ 52,939 $ 52,887 $ 52,094 $ 50,832 Total tangible assets(c) 52,176 51,863 51,495 50,891 49,869 49,801 48,990 47,708 Earning assets 48,852 48,691 48,341 47,853 46,970 46,454 45,757 44,335 Investment securities 8,400 8,230 8,320 8,679 8,475 8,437 8,161 7,656 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 40,331 40,335 39,911 39,073 38,398 37,950 37,522 36,515 Deposits 37,100 37,199 37,306 36,293 35,429 34,976 34,954 33,341 Stockholders equity(c) 5,876 5,847 5,838 5,674 5,730 5,710 5,657 5,734 Tangible stockholders equity(c) 2,906 2,869 2,851 2,678 2,724 2,694 2,629 2,674 Equity per common share 52.39 51.81 51.20 49.78 49.68 49.11 48.21 48.17 Tangible equity per common share 25.91 25.42 25.00 23.49 23.62 23.17 22.40 22.47 Market price per common share High $ 112.50 $ 112.50 $ 107.28 $ 108.04 $ 108.75 $ 98.66 $ 92.70 $ 98.65 Low 96.71 103.50 98.75 96.71 95.40 86.80 82.90 88.08 Closing 109.05 105.71 105.16 102.06 107.84 95.70 87.30 89.85 (a) Excludes impact of net securities transactions.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $55.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.). M&T Bank, with total assets of $54.4 billion at December 31, 2005, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 658 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency. M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $625 million at December 31, 2005, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. 29 On April 1, 2003, M&T completed the acquisition of Allfirst Financial Inc. (Allfirst), a bank holding company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, from Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB), Dublin, Ireland. Allfirst Bank, Allfirsts primary bank subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Allfirst Bank operated 269 banking offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia at the date of acquisition. As of the acquisition date, total consolidated assets of Allfirst and its subsidiaries were $16.5 billion, including $10.3 billion of loans and leases and $1.3 billion of investment securities, and total consolidated liabilities assumed were $14.5 billion, including $10.9 billion of deposits. The acquisition of Allfirst represented a major geographic expansion by M&T and created a strong Mid Atlantic banking franchise. AIB received 26,700,000 shares of M&T common stock and $886 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding Allfirst common shares. The results of operations acquired in the Allfirst transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since April 1, 2003. The Company recorded approximately $1.8 billion of goodwill and $199 million of core deposit and other intangible assets as a result of the Allfirst acquisition. Merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $60 million ($39 million after tax effect). Such expenses were for professional services and temporary help associated with the conversion of systems and or integration of operations; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to Allfirsts customers; travel and relocation costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices. There were no similar merger related expenses incurred during 2004 or 2005. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in the determination of goodwill associated with the Allfirst merger were charges totaling $29 million, net of applicable income taxes ($48 million before tax effect), for severance costs for former Allfirst employees; investment banking and other professional fees; and termination of Allfirst contracts for various services. As of December 31, 2005, there were no significant amounts of unpaid merger related expenses or charges included in the determination of goodwill. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. 30 However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview The Companys net income for 2005 totaled $782 million or $6.73 of diluted earnings per common share, representing increases of 8% and 12%, respectively, from $723 million or $6.00 of diluted earnings per share in 2004. Basic earnings per common share were $6.88 in 2005, 12% higher than $6.14 in 2004. Net income in 2003 was $574 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $4.95 and $5.08, respectively. The after tax impact of merger related expenses associated with the Allfirst acquisition was $39 million ($60 million pre tax) or $.34 of diluted earnings per share and $.35 of basic earnings per share in 2003. There were no similar expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Net income represented a return on average assets in 2005 of 1.44%, compared with 1.40% in 2004 and 1.27% in 2003. The return on average common stockholders equity was 13.49% in 2005, 12.67% in 2004 and 11.62% in 2003. Excluding the impact of merger related expenses, the rates of return on average assets and average common equity in 2003 were 1.35% and 12.41%, respectively. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 3% to $1.81 billion in 2005 from $1.75 billion in 2004, largely due to higher average earning assets, which rose 6% to $48.1 billion in 2005 from $45.2 billion in 2004. The higher level of average earning assets was driven by increased balances of loans, leases and investment securities. Average loans and leases of $39.5 billion in 2005 were 6% higher than $37.1 billion in 2004, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $921 million, or 10%, commercial real estate loans of $1.1 billion, or 8%, and consumer real estate loans of $814 million, or 26%, offset by a $413 million, or 4% decline in consumer loans and leases. Average balances of investment securities rose 6% to $8.5 billion in 2005 from $8.0 billion in 2004. Partially offsetting the impact of growth in earning assets was a narrowing of the net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The net interest margin declined 31 11 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004, due largely to rising short term interest rates that produced a flattening of the yield curve in 2005 as compared with historic norms and had the effect of increasing rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earnings assets. Also as a result of higher average earning assets, taxable equivalent net interest income in 2004 was 8% higher than $1.62 billion in 2003. Average earning assets in 2004 increased 14% from $39.5 billion in 2003. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2004 increased $3.2 billion, or 9%, from $34.0 billion in 2003, largely due to the full year impact of loans obtained in the April 1, 2003 acquisition of Allfirst. Included in the 2003 average was the nine month impact of the $10.3 billion of loans and leases obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Net interest margin in 2004 declined 21 basis points from 4.09% in 2003, largely due to lower yields earned on loans and investment securities. The provision for credit losses was $88 million in 2005, down from $95 million in 2004 and $131 million in 2003. The lower levels of the provision during the past two years as compared with 2003 were reflective of favorable credit quality. Net charge offs declined to $77 million in 2005 from $82 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding decreased to .19% in 2005 from .22% in 2004 and .28% in 2003. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans. Noninterest income increased 1% to $950 million in 2005 from $943 million in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). A write down was taken on $133 million of variable rate preferred securities held in the Companys portfolio of available for sale investment securities. Although the securities are rated as investment grade, the Company recognized the impairment charge, in accordance with GAAP, in light of changing circumstances during 2005s third quarter that included an announced further delay in FNMAs ability to provide restated financial information about its results of operations until late 2006 and a further decline in the market value of certain of FHLMCs preferred stock issuances despite its release of operating results. However, because the preferred securities have been held in the available for sale investment securities portfolio, the unrealized losses had already been recorded as reductions of other comprehensive income and, therefore, no incremental reductions of investment securities or stockholders equity were required. Accordingly, the accounting treatment for the impairment charge made pursuant to GAAP had no significant effect on M&Ts consolidated balance sheet. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Noninterest income aggregated $831 million in 2003. The increase in such income in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related income in 2004 compared with nine months of similar income in 2003. Excluding Allfirst related revenues, higher levels of service charges on deposit accounts, letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related income were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues resulting from a lower level of loan originations in 2004. Noninterest expense in 2005 totaled $1.49 billion, down 2% from $1.52 billion in 2004. Noninterest expense in 2003 was $1.45 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $57 million, $75 million and $78 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and merger related expenses of $60 million in 2003. As already noted, there were no merger related expenses in 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.43 billion in 2005, $1.44 billion in 2004 and $1.31 billion in 2003. As compared with 2004, increases in the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and higher professional services expenses in 2005 were partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher 32 residential mortgage loan interest rates. Included in 2004s operating expenses was a $25 million tax deductible contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt private charitable foundation. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. A significant portion of the increase in noninterest expense in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related expenses in 2004 compared with nine months of similar expenses in 2003. Also contributing to the higher expenses in 2004 was the $25 million charitable contribution. The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 51.2% in 2005, improved from 53.5% in 2004 and 53.6% in 2003. If the $25 million charitable contribution was excluded from the computation, the efficiency ratio for 2004 would have been 52.6%.

(b) Interest income data are on a taxable equivalent basis. The taxable equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 39% for 2005, 2004 and 2002, 36% for 2003, and 37% for 2001. Supplemental Reporting of Non GAAP Results of Operations M&T has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the Company had recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.1 billion at both December 31, 2004 and 2003. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $2.9 billion at 33 December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $35 million, $46 million and $48 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, in which M&T excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Net operating income rose 6% to $817 million in 2005 from $769 million in 2004. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2005 increased to $7.03, 10% higher than $6.38 in 2004. In 2003, net operating income totaled $661 million and diluted net operating earnings per share were $5.70. A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share is presented in table 2. Expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets, net operating income was 1.60% in 2005, compared with 1.59% in 2004 and 1.55% in 2003. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 29.06% in 2005, compared with 28.76% and 28.49% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Including the effect of merger related expenses, net operating return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in 2003 was 1.46% and 26.80%, respectively. 34 A reconciliation of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity is presented in table 2.

Such assets totaled $48.1 billion in 2005, up 6% from $45.2 billion in 2004. Increases of 6% in each of average outstanding balances of loans and leases and average balances of investment securities contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting the positive impact on taxable equivalent net interest income of higher average earning assets was a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2005 grew 6% to $39.5 billion from $37.1 billion in 2004. The Company experienced growth in most major loan categories during 2005 as compared with 2004. Average commercial loans and leases rose 10% to $10.5 billion in 2005 from $9.5 billion in 2004, reflecting, in part, a $212 million rise in average automobile floor plan loans outstanding. Commercial real estate loans averaged $14.3 billion during 2005, up 8% from $13.3 billion in 2004. Contributing to that increase were $467 million of higher average balances of construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Average residential real estate loan balances increased 26% to $3.9 billion in 2005 from $3.1 billion in 2004. Higher residential real estate loans held for sale by M&T Mortgage Corporation were the most significant contributor to that increase. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.8 billion during 2005, down 4% from $11.2 billion in 2004. Average balances of automobile loans and leases decreased 16% to $3.7 billion in 2005 from $4.4 billion in 2004, largely due to the Companys decision to not match the pricing being offered by competitors. Partially offsetting the drop in automobile loan and lease balances was a 13% rise in average outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit to $4.0 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 8% to $1.75 billion in 2004 from $1.62 billion in 2003. That improvement reflected a 14% increase in average earning assets to $45.2 billion in 2004 from $39.5 billion in 2003, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.88% in 2004 from 4.09% in 2003. The growth in average earning assets reflects higher average loans and leases outstanding, which totaled $37.1 billion in 2004, up 9% from 2003s average of $34.0 billion, and higher investment securities balances which averaged $8.0 billion in 2004, up 50% from $5.3 billion in 2003. The 2003 average loan and lease balance reflected the impact of $10.3 billion of loans obtained on April 1, 2003 in the Allfirst acquisition for the final nine months of that year, while the 2004 average balance reflected a full year impact of Allfirst related loans. The $10.3 billion of acquired loans were comprised of approximately $4.5 billion of commercial loans and leases (including $314 million of leveraged leases and $230 million of loans to foreign borrowers), $2.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $383 million of residential real estate loans and $2.9 billion of consumer loans and leases. 36 Table 3 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT RATES 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate (Average balance in millions; interest in thousands) Assets Earning assets Loans and leases, net of unearned discount(a) Commercial, financial, etc. $ 10,455 $ 589,644 5.64 % 9,534 410,258 4.30 % 8,523 358,629 4.21 % 5,146 261,867 5.09 % 5,271 372,234 7.06 % Real estate commercial 14,341 941,017 6.56 13,264 763,134 5.75 11,573 706,022 6.10 9,498 661,382 6.96 9,224 732,162 7.94 Real estate consumer 3,925 235,364 6.00 3,111 184,125 5.92 3,777 232,454 6.15 4,087 285,055 6.98 4,354 328,979 7.55 Consumer 10,808 664,509 6.15 11,220 626,255 5.58 10,098 607,909 6.02 6,776 467,167 6.89 5,581 464,151 8.32 Total loans and leases, net 39,529 2,430,534 6.15 37,129 1,983,772 5.34 33,971 1,905,014 5.61 25,507 1,675,471 6.57 24,430 1,897,526 7.77 Money market assets Interest bearing deposits at banks 10 169 1.64 13 65 .51 14 147 1.03 6 76 1.32 4 116 3.10 Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities 23 808 3.55 8 134 1.60 147 1,875 1.28 272 4,455 1.63 63 2,027 3.22 Trading account 80 1,544 1.92 53 418 .79 55 647 1.18 13 247 1.86 13 413 3.16 Total money market assets 113 2,521 2.22 74 617 .83 216 2,669 1.24 291 4,778 1.64 80 2,556 3.20 Investment securities(b) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 3,479 134,528 3.87 4,169 158,953 3.81 2,599 106,209 4.09 1,292 81,412 6.30 1,709 113,908 6.67 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 180 10,860 6.04 218 15,017 6.90 251 15,827 6.30 279 17,828 6.40 332 24,483 7.37 Other 4,817 227,562 4.72 3,610 157,703 4.37 2,494 113,159 4.54 1,552 76,659 4.94 1,267 80,925 6.39 Total investment securities 8,476 372,950 4.40 7,997 331,673 4.15 5,344 235,195 4.40 3,123 175,899 5.63 3,308 219,316 6.63 Total earning assets 48,118 2,806,005 5.83 45,200 2,316,062 5.13 39,531 2,142,878 5.42 28,921 1,856,148 6.42 27,818 2,119,398 7.62 Allowance for credit losses (638 ) (626 ) (574 ) (438 ) (409 ) Cash and due from banks 1,400 1,599 1,542 732 706 Other assets 5,255 5,344 4,850 2,720 2,727 Total assets $ 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 30,842 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities Interest bearing deposits NOW accounts $ 400 2,182 .55 550 1,802 .33 1,021 3,613 .35 761 3,900 .51 722 8,548 1.18 Savings deposits 14,889 139,445 .94 15,305 92,064 .60 13,278 102,190 .77 8,899 107,281 1.21 7,378 134,454 1.82 Time deposits 9,158 294,782 3.22 6,948 154,722 2.23 6,638 159,700 2.41 7,398 237,001 3.20 8,906 453,940 5.10 Deposits at foreign office 3,819 120,122 3.15 3,136 43,034 1.37 1,445 14,991 1.04 569 8,460 1.49 327 11,264 3.44 Total interest bearing deposits 28,266 556,531 1.97 25,939 291,622 1.12 22,382 280,494 1.25 17,627 356,642 2.02 17,333 608,206 3.51 Short term borrowings 4,890 157,853 3.23 5,142 71,172 1.38 4,331 49,064 1.13 3,125 52,723 1.69 3,280 124,810 3.81 Long term borrowings 6,411 279,967 4.37 5,832 201,366 3.45 6,018 198,252 3.29 4,162 185,149 4.45 3,538 210,581 5.95 Total interest bearing liabilities 39,567 994,351 2.51 36,913 564,160 1.53 32,731 527,810 1.61 24,914 594,514 2.39 24,151 943,597 3.91 Noninterest bearing deposits 8,050 8,039 6,801 3,618 3,327 Other liabilities 720 864 876 377 389 Total liabilities 48,337 45,816 40,408 28,909 27,867 Stockholders equity 5,798 5,701 4,941 3,026 2,975 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 30,842 Net interest spread 3.32 3.60 3.81 4.03 3.71 Contribution of interest free funds .45 .28 .28 .33 .52 Net interest income/margin on earning assets $ 1,811,654 3.77 % 1,751,902 3.88 % 1,615,068 4.09 % 1,261,634 4.36 % 1,175,801 4.23 % (a) Includes nonaccrual loans.

Average commercial real estate loans were $13.3 billion in 2004, 15% higher than $11.6 billion in 2003. Excluding the impact of the loans in the former Allfirst regions, average balances of outstanding commercial real estate loans grew $936 million in 2004 from 2003. Average consumer loans and leases totaled $11.2 billion during 2004, up 11% from $10.1 billion in the previous year, largely the result of growth in the automobile loan and home equity line of credit portfolios. The full year impact of Allfirst related loans and a $362 million increase in average automobile floor plan loans were the most significant contributors to higher average commercial loans and leases, which totaled $9.5 billion in 2004, 12% above 2003s average of $8.5 billion. Average residential real estate loans declined in 2004 due largely to customer repayments of loans and the full year impact of two separate securitization transactions totaling $1.3 billion of such loans during 2003s final quarter. In connection with the first 2003 securitization transaction, the Company transferred approximately $838 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust. The Company received $112 million in cash and retained approximately 87% of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans. The Company realized a gain of $1 million on the transaction which was included in other revenues from operations. In 2003s second securitization transaction and in a similar securitization transaction in 2005s final quarter, approximately $441 million and $126 million, respectively, of one to four family residential mortgage loans were converted to mortgage backed securities issued by FNMA. All of those mortgage backed securities were retained by the Company and, accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized. In each securitization, the retained securities were added to the Companys portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale. There were no comparable securitization transactions in 2004. In accordance with GAAP, the qualified special purpose trust related to the first 2003 mortgage loan securitization transaction is not included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the resulting mortgage backed securities provide enhanced liquidity opportunities to the Company because the securities may be more readily pledged to secure borrowings or sold than the underlying loans could be. Additionally, under present regulatory risk based capital rules, the Company is generally required to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital when directly investing in residential real estate loans than when investing in government guaranteed or highly rated, privately placed mortgage backed securities. Additional information about these transactions and qualified special purpose trusts is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Information about the Companys regulatory capital requirements is included in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. 38 Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2005 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Table 5 presents such commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2005 by geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $10.9 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the 2005 year end, approximately $9.0 billion, or 82%, were secured, while 47%, 26% and 13% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2005 aggregated $1.1 billion of which 39% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 10% secured by collateral in Maryland, and 13% secured by collateral in Pennsylvania. International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $217 million and $230 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under this program at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $200 million and $204 million, respectively. The Companys commercial aircraft lease portfolio totaled $59 million at December 31, 2005 and $82 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005 AIB was obligated to indemnify the Company for losses on approximately $32 million of those aircraft leases. The Company has decided not to pursue growing the commercial aircraft component of the lease portfolio. 39 Table 5 COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LEASES, NET OF UNEARNED DISCOUNT (Excluding Loans Secured by Real Estate) December 31, 2005 Percent of Dollars Outstanding by Loan Size Outstandings $0 1 $1 5 $5 10 $10 15 $15+ (Dollars in millions) New York State Secured $ 3,870 24 % 23 % 15 % 5 % 8 % Unsecured 875 5 7 3 2 Leases 429 4 3 1 Total New York State 5,174 33 % 33 % 19 % 7 % 8 % Pennsylvania Secured 2,273 28 % 24 % 15 % 6 % 9 % Unsecured 365 5 5 2 1 1 Leases 149 2 1 1 Total Pennsylvania 2,787 35 % 30 % 17 % 7 % 11 % Maryland Secured 972 29 % 20 % 8 % 4 % 6 % Unsecured 355 6 6 2 1 10 Leases 111 5 2 1 Total Maryland 1,438 40 % 28 % 11 % 5 % 16 % Other Secured 737 10 % 19 % 12 % 2 % 5 % Unsecured 365 9 5 3 7 Leases 419 6 9 6 5 2 Total other 1,521 25 % 33 % 21 % 7 % 14 % Total commercial loans and leases $ 10,920 33 % 31 % 18 % 7 % 11 % Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 60% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2005, compared with 58% in each of 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005, the Company held approximately $14.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $4.4 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties and $5.3 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $14.0 billion, $3.3 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004. A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction loans, adjustable rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 42% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2005. Table 6 presents commercial real estate 40 loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2005. Of the $4.6 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 34% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 41% by retail space and 10% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $15 million made up approximately 21% of the total.

Approximately 73% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 79% and 56%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 15% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2005. Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6 totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2005, or 4% of total loans and leases. Approximately 97% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2005 were $926 million of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes including the construction of office buildings, multi family residential housing, retail space and other commercial development. M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by FNMA and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one third of outstanding principal. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 approximately $941 million and $926 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $199 million and $61 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled $4.4 billion at December 31, 2005, including approximately 37% secured by properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 9% secured by properties located in Maryland. At December 31, 2005, $1.2 billion of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $790 million at December 31, 2004. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $583 million at December 31, 2005, or approximately 1% of total loans and leases, compared with $431 million or 1% at December 31, 2004. Consumer loans and leases represented approximately 27% of the average loan portfolio during 2005, compared with 30% in both 2004 and 2003. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are automobile loans and leases and outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 10% of average loans outstanding in 2005 and 2004. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 9% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2005, down from 12% in 2004. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2005. Approximately 55% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005 were secured by properties in New York State and 18% and 22% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit totaled $4.0 billion in 2005, 13% higher than $3.5 billion in 2004. The Company continues to pursue growing this portfolio, which has historically experienced a lower level of credit losses than other types of consumer loans. At December 31, 2005, 31% and 35% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal 42 underwriting and loan approval procedures. Since mid 2004, the Company has experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business, resulting from increased competition from other lenders, including financing incentives offered by automobile manufacturers. The Company chose not to match the pricing being offered by many competitors. The average outstanding balance of automobile leases was approximately $137 million in 2005, $308 million in 2004 and $527 million in 2003. The Company ceased origination of automobile leases during 2003. The decision to cease origination of automobile leases did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, outstanding automobile leases totaled $85 million and $205 million, respectively. Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2005, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 47% of total loans and leases at the 2005 year end were to New York State customers, while 22% and 13% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively.

Average balances of investment securities were $8.5 billion in 2005, compared with $8.0 billion and $5.3 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was the result of net purchases in late 2004 and in 2005 consisting largely of collateralized residential mortgage obligations. The retention of mortgage backed securities related to securitizations of residential real estate loans added approximately $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $817 million to average investment securities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Also contributing to 2004s higher average balance were purchases of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations during the year. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and 43 preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company concluded that such declines were temporary in nature. As previously discussed, events occurring during 2005s third quarter resulted in the Company recognizing an other than temporary impairment charge of $29 million related to preferred securities of FNMA and FHLMC. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Money market assets are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks, interest earning trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Average money market assets were $113 million in 2005, $74 million in 2004 and $216 million in 2003. The amounts of investment securities and money market assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and money market assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. Core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the Company and are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Also included in core deposits are certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. Core deposits averaged $27.9 billion in 2005, $28.1 billion in 2004 and $25.8 billion in 2003. Core deposits assumed in connection with the Allfirst acquisition totaled approximately $10.7 billion on April 1, 2003. The rise in average balances of time deposits less than $100,000 in 2005 as compared with 2004 was due, in part, to higher interest rates, as customers shifted their funds from savings and non interest bearing deposit accounts to time deposits. Due to the historically low interest rate environment in 2003 and for much of 2004, the Company experienced a significant shift in the composition of core deposits in those years. Reflecting a change in customer saving trends, average core savings and noninterest bearing deposits rose during those periods, while average time deposits under $100,000 decreased, exclusive of the impact of core deposits obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $216 million in 2005, $223 million in 2004 and $267 million in 2003. Funding provided by core deposits represented 58% of average earning assets in 2005, compared with 62% in 2004 and 65% in 2003. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2005 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Table 8 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2005 2004 to 2005 2003 to 2004 (Dollars in millions) NOW accounts $ 400 (27 )% (46 )% Savings deposits 14,827 (3 ) 15 Time deposits under $100,000 4,624 8 (10 ) Noninterest bearing deposits 8,050 18 Total $ 27,901 (1 )% 9 % 44 The Company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $1.8 billion in 2005, and $1.2 billion in each of 2004 and 2003. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $3.8 billion in 2005, $3.1 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. Average brokered time deposits totaled $2.7 billion in 2005, compared with $1.4 billion in 2004 and $643 million in 2003, and at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $3.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits at December 31, 2005 was 15 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $515 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts, which averaged $62 million, $57 million and $70 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Pittsburgh and Atlanta (together, the FHLB), and others as sources of funding. The average balance of short term borrowings was $4.9 billion in 2005, $5.1 billion in 2004 and $4.3 billion in 2003. Unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, included in short term borrowings averaged $4.1 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest component of short term borrowings and are obtained daily from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Amounts borrowed from the FHLB and included in short term borrowings averaged $439 million in 2003, while there were no similar short term borrowings from the FHLB during 2005 or 2004. Also included in short term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Long term borrowings averaged $6.4 billion in 2005, $5.8 billion in 2004 and $6.0 billion in 2003. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLB of $3.8 billion in 2005, $3.3 billion in 2004 and $3.9 billion in 2003, and subordinated capital notes of $1.3 billion in 2005 and 2004, and $1.2 billion in 2003. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for $409 million of subordinated notes bearing a fixed coupon rate of interest of 5.585% through December 27, 2015 and a variable rate of interest equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215% from December 28, 2015 to the maturity date of December 28, 2020. Beginning December 28, 2015, the Company may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the new notes on any interest payment date. In accordance with GAAP, the Company accounted for the exchange as a modification of debt terms and not as an extinguishment of debt because, among other factors, the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new subordinated notes was not at least ten percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original terms of the exchanged subordinated notes. Coincident with the exchange, the Company terminated $363 million out of a total notional amount of $500 million of interest rate swap agreements that were used to hedge the 8.0% subordinated notes. Under the terms of the swap agreements, the Company pays a variable rate of interest and receives a fixed rate. The Company paid $15 million to terminate the $363 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements. A hedge valuation adjustment of $15 million related to the $363 million of exchanged subordinated notes continues to be part of the carrying value of the new subordinated notes and will be amortized to interest expense over the period to expected maturity of the new notes. The new subordinated notes 45 have an effective rate of 7.76%. The $137 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement that was not terminated continues to hedge the remaining $137 million of 8.0% subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long term borrowings were $711 million and $710 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Trust preferred securities associated with junior subordinated debentures of M&T included in average long term borrowings in 2003 totaled $595 million. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as described herein, changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income. During 2005, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate eight times, each increase representing a 25 basis point increment over the previously effective target rate. Those interest rate increases resulted in a more rapid rise in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, most notably short term borrowings, than in the yields on earning assets, and contributed to a flattening of the yield curve. That flattening removed much of the differential between longer term interest rates and shorter term interest rates. The result of these conditions was a contraction of the net interest spread from 2004 to 2005. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, was 3.32% in 2005, down from 3.60% in 2004. The yield on earning assets during 2005 was 5.83%, up 70 basis points from 5.13% in 2004, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 98 basis points to 2.51% from 1.53% in 2004. The yield on the Companys earning assets decreased 29 basis points in 2004 from 5.42% in 2003, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2004 was down 8 basis points from 1.61%. During the period from June 30, 2004 through December 31, 2004, the Federal Reserve raised its federal funds target rate five times, in 25 basis point increments over the previously effective target rate. Lower rates earned on assets, including commercial real estate and automobile loans and investment securities, combined with short term liabilities that repriced more rapidly than many of the Companys variable rate earning assets, caused a contraction of the net interest spread from 2003 to 2004. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 3.81% in 2003 to 3.60% in 2004. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest free funds averaged $8.6 billion in 2005, compared with $8.3 billion in 2004 and $6.8 billion in 2003. The significant increase in such funds in 2004 as compared with 2003 was largely due to the full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition and growth in other noninterest bearing deposits. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.0 billion in 2005, $3.1 billion in 2004 and $2.7 billion in 2003. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.0 billion in 2005, $974 million in 2004 and $858 million in 2003. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was .45% in 2005, and .28% in both 2004 and 2003. The rise in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2005 as compared with 2004 and 2003 resulted largely from the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.77% in 2005, compared with 3.88% in 2004 and 4.09% in 2003. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin. In general, the Companys net interest margin has been declining since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in June 2004. Continued pressure on the Companys net interest margin is expected until the Federal Reserve slows or stops increasing interest rates. 46 Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of December 31, 2005 was $652 million. Under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates. As of December 31, 2005, all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $9 million and $4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

(b) Weighted average rate paid or received on interest rate swap agreements in effect during year. Provision For Credit Losses The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. Reflecting continued improvement in 47 credit quality factors, the provision for credit losses was $88 million in 2005, down from $95 million in 2004 and $131 million in 2003. Net loan charge offs declined to $77 million in 2005 from $82 million and $97 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were ..19% in 2005, compared with .22% in 2004 and .28% in 2003. A summary of loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10. Table 10 LOAN CHARGE OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Allowance for credit losses beginning balance $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 $ 374,703 Charge offs during year Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 32,210 33,340 44,782 57,401 35,555 Real estate construction 2 88 Real estate mortgage 4,708 10,829 13,999 13,969 13,849 Consumer 70,699 74,856 68,737 53,124 44,750 Total charge offs 107,617 119,025 127,520 124,582 94,154 Recoveries during year Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 6,513 13,581 12,517 3,129 3,949 Real estate construction 4 Real estate mortgage 3,887 4,051 3,436 2,333 4,027 Consumer 20,330 19,700 15,047 11,370 10,871 Total recoveries 30,730 37,332 31,004 16,832 18,847 Net charge offs 76,887 81,693 96,516 107,750 75,307 Provision for credit losses 88,000 95,000 131,000 122,000 103,500 Allowance for credit losses acquired during the year 146,300 22,112 Allowance related to loans sold or securitized (314 ) (501 ) (3,198 ) (2,786 ) Allowance for credit losses ending balance $ 637,663 $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 Net charge offs as a percent of: Provision for credit losses 87.37 % 85.99 % 73.68 % 88.32 % 72.76 % Average loans and leases, net of unearned discount .19 % .22 % .28 % .42 % .31 % Allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans and leases, net of unearned discount, at year end 1.58 % 1.63 % 1.72 % 1.70 % 1.69 % Nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, aggregated $156 million or .39% of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2005, compared with $172 million or .45% at December 31, 2004 and $240 million or .67% at December 31, 2003. The lower level of 48 nonperforming loans at the 2005 year end as compared with a year earlier reflects an overall improvement in borrower repayment performance. In addition to a general improvement in repayment performance by borrowers, the sale of two large commercial loans during 2004 for cash equal to the $37 million carrying value of the loans contributed to the decrease in the amount of loans classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2004 as compared with December 31, 2003. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $129 million or .32% total loans and leases at December 31, 2005, compared with $155 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003, representing .40% and .43% of total loans and leases at those respective dates. Those loans included $106 million, $121 million and $125 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of loans guaranteed by government related entities. Such guaranteed loans included one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with them, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government related entities and totaled $79 million at December 31, 2005, $104 million at December 31, 2004 and $122 million at December 31, 2003. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export Import Bank of the United States that totaled $26 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $17 million and $1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.

Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Commercial loans and leases charged off during 2005, net of recoveries, were $26 million, compared with $20 million in 2004 and $32 million in 2003. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases aggregated $39 million at December 31, 2005, $45 million a year earlier and $105 million at December 31, 2003. As noted earlier, the decreases in such loans largely reflect improvement in the repayment performance of borrowers. Net recoveries of commercial real estate loans during 2005 totaled $1 million, compared with net charge offs in 2004 and 2003 of $3 million and $6 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming totaled $44 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $45 million at December 31, 2004 and $48 million at December 31, 2003. Net charge offs of residential real estate loans during 2005 were $2 million, compared with $4 million in 2004 and $5 million in 2003. Nonperforming residential real estate loans at 2005s year end totaled $29 million, compared with $44 million and $51 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest aggregated $96 million, $127 million and $141 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As already noted, a substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government related entities. During 2005, net charge offs of consumer loans and leases totaled $50 million, representing .47% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $55 million or ..49% in 2004 and $54 million or .53% in 2003. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Charge offs of indirect automobile loans and leases during each of 2005 and 2004, net of recoveries, were $37 million, and in 2003 were $32 million. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases were $44 million at December 31, 2005, representing .42% of outstanding consumer loans and leases, compared with $38 million or ..35% at December 31, 2004 and $36 million or .33% at December 31, 2003. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $1 million at December 31, 2005, $2 million at December 31, 2004 and $3 million at December 31, 2003. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2005 in light of (i) the sluggish pace of economic growth in many of the markets served by the Company; (ii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central 50 Pennsylvania; and (iii) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies. Although the 2006 economic outlook predicts moderate national growth with inflation expected to be reasonably well contained, concerns exist about higher energy prices; a waning housing boom; Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans resulting from rising interest rates; sluggish job creation, which could cause consumer spending to slow; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and sluggish commercial loan demand in many market areas served by the Company. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following paragraphs describe these components. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all commercial and commercial real estate loans which are in nonaccrual status. Specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; national and local economic conditions and trends; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective 51 determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties; customer, industry and geographic concentrations; and expansion into new products and market areas. The unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically the western and central portions of New York State and Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; (iii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (iv) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; (v) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans; and (vi) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. Commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2005. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market was 0.6%, or one third the national average. The manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company also lagged the national average. In contrast, job growth was higher than the national average in the Hudson Valley region of New York State (1.8%), Maryland (2.4%) and Northern Virginia (4.0%) in 2005. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness, high energy prices, weak population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions that lagged national population growth trends and other factors, continue to indicate an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York and Pennsylvania where more than two thirds of its lending business is conducted. A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in table 12. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $93 million at December 31, 2005 and $106 million at December 31, 2004. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $15 million at December 31, 2005 and $17 million at December 31, 2004. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .51% and .42% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses from the end of 2004 to December 31, 2005 was largely attributable to the factors described herein, including the significantly poorer economic environment and performance in many of the major market regions served by the Company, the uncertain impact that significantly higher interest rates and energy prices were having on the economy, in general, and on borrowers abilities to repay loans, and managements lack of familiarity and long term experience evaluating the impact of changing economic conditions on the performance of borrowers located in market areas entered through the Allfirst acquisition. Given the prolonged underperformance of the economies of many of the regions served by the Company over a number of years and the significant size of the loan portfolio in the Companys new market regions entered through the Allfirst acquisition, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit 52 losses. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Table 12 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES December 31 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. $ 136,852 $ 147,550 $ 186,902 $ 120,627 $ 130,156 Real estate 161,003 166,910 170,493 152,758 139,848 Consumer 133,541 148,591 152,759 113,711 94,710 Unallocated 206,267 163,813 103,904 49,376 60,294 Total $ 637,663 $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 $ 425,008 As a percentage of gross loans and leases outstanding Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. 1.23 % 1.45 % 1.99 % 2.23 % 2.50 % Real estate .85 .96 1.10 1.17 1.00 Consumer 1.27 1.33 1.37 1.51 1.52 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2005 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $638 million or 1.58% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2005, compared with $627 million or 1.63% at December 31, 2004 and $614 million or 1.72% at December 31, 2003. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases since the 2003 year end reflects continued improvement in certain credit factors, including the already discussed decreases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses reflect sustained positive trends and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios decline, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans will decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 408%, 364% and 256%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows a consistent methodology as described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality: For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 10 basis point increase in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. 53 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were: For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5 basis point decrease in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $45 million in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $14 million reduction in such losses could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties and properties used in providing retail goods and services in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% and 5%, respectively, of loans outstanding at December 31, 2005. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2005. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $217 million at December 31, 2005, or .5% of total loans and leases. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $9 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $13 million and $20 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other Income Other income totaled $950 million in 2005, compared with $943 million in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues were offset by losses from investment securities, which reflect the already discussed $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to the Companys investment in certain preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, other income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Other income in 2004 increased 13% from the $831 million earned in 2003. The rise in such income in 2004 over the prior year was attributable to the full year impact of revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former Allfirst franchise. Excluding Allfirst related revenues, higher levels of service charges on deposit accounts, letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related sales commissions and other revenues were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues. Mortgage banking revenues were $136 million in 2005, compared with $124 million in 2004 and $149 million in 2003. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities are largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program. Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, rose 7% to $107 million in 2005 from $100 million in 2004. Higher origination activity in 2005 as compared with 2004 was the most significant factor contributing to the increase in revenues. Residential mortgage banking revenues in 2004 were 23% lower than the $129 million earned in 2003, primarily due to lower levels of loan originations. Also contributing to 2004s decreased revenues was the adoption of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. In March 2004, the SEC issued SAB No. 105, which provides guidance regarding the accounting for loans held for sale and loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. In accordance with SAB No. 105, effective April 1, 2004, value ascribable to loan cash flows that will ultimately be realized in connection with mortgage servicing activities should not be included in the determination of fair value of loans held for sale or commitments to originate loans for sale, but rather should only be recognized at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold. The Companys adoption of the SEC guidance resulted in a deferral of mortgage banking revenues of approximately $6 million in 2004 as 54 compared with 2003. Neither the amount or timing of receipt of cash flows nor the economic value of the loans and commitments were changed as a result of this accounting guidance. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $7.7 billion in 2005, compared with $4.8 billion in 2004 and $5.9 billion in 2003. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $42 million in 2005, up from $32 million in 2004, but down from $65 million in 2003. On May 1, 2005, M&T Mortgage Corporation assumed the operations of Regions Financial Corporations wholesale residential mortgage business. Those operations added 13 locations and approximately 140 employees to M&T Mortgage Corporations business. Approximately $1.7 billion of residential mortgage loans originated in 2005 for sale to other investors were related to the assumed operations. Nevertheless, including the effect of expenses, the operations assumed did not have a material impact on the Companys net income during 2005. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others increased to $58 million in 2005 from $57 million in 2004 and $54 million in 2003. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $10 million, $6 million and $5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $15.6 billion at December 31, 2005, $14.9 billion a year earlier and $13.6 billion at December 31, 2003, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $2.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $140 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $133 million and $129 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $23 million, $13 million and $8 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre determined rates were $923 million and $352 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, $764 million and $422 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $824 million and $459 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Net unrealized losses on residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $5 million at December 31, 2005, compared with net unrealized gains of $3 million and $7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net decreases in revenue of $8 million in 2005, $4 million in 2004 (reflecting a $6 million decrease attributable to the implementation of SAB No. 105) and $8 million in 2003. Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $29 million in 2005, compared with $25 million and $20 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $14 million in 2005, compared with $13 million during each of 2004 and 2003. Loan servicing revenues increased to $15 million in 2005 from $12 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets totaled $21 million at December 31, 2005 and $22 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $4.3 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and included $941 million, $926 million and $825 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $241 million and $42 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, $167 million and $106 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $72 million and $71 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $199 million, $61 million and $1 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $370 million in 2005, compared with $366 million in 2004. Higher consumer service charges, largely resulting from higher debit card transaction volumes 55 and overdraft fees, were partially offset by lower commercial service charges. Deposit account service charges in 2004 were 18% higher than $310 million in 2003. Approximately 80% of that year over year increase was in regions associated with Allfirst and was largely due to the full year impact of that transaction. Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income aggregated $135 million in 2005, down slightly from $136 million a year earlier. The impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds caused the decline in revenues from 2004 to 2005. Trust income grew 19% in 2004 from $115 million in 2003 due to the full year impact of the Allfirst transaction. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, were $134.0 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $128.4 billion at December 31, 2004. Trust assets under management totaled $21.6 billion and $22.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, totaled $56 million in 2005, 3% higher than $54 million in 2004 due largely to higher revenues earned from the sale of mutual funds. Brokerage services income was $51 million in 2003. The increase from 2003 to 2004 was the result of revenues earned in the former Allfirst regions. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $23 million in 2005, $19 million in 2004 and $16 million in 2003. The higher gains in 2005 and 2004 as compared with 2003 were due in part to increased volumes of trading assets and liabilities and reflect fees and market value changes related to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $15 million, $11 million and $7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $41 million and $40 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of such assets were $3 million in 2005, $4 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in deferred compensation liabilities is included in other costs of operations. As a result of the previously described charge for the other than temporary impairment in value of the FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock, losses on investment securities aggregated $28 million during 2005, compared with gains of $3 million and $2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other revenues from operations rose to $259 million in 2005 from $240 million in 2004 and $188 million in 2003. A $5 million increase in revenues from providing corporate financing advisory services and a $7 million increase in gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property contributed to the higher revenues in 2005 as compared with 2004. The increase from 2003 to 2004 was largely due to the full year impact of revenues associated with the Allfirst transaction. Higher letter of credit and other credit related fees and insurance related sales commissions and other revenues also contributed to the increase from 2003 to 2004. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit related fees totaled $75 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $47 million, $48 million and $45 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $30 million in 2005, $28 million in 2004 and $26 million in 2003. Insurance related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $22 million in each of 2005 and 2004, compared with $18 million in 2003. ATM usage fees aggregated $22 million in 2005 and in 2004, compared with $19 million in 2003. 56 Other Expense Other expense decreased 2% to $1.49 billion in 2005 from $1.52 billion in 2004. In 2003, other expense totaled $1.45 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $57 million, $75 million and $78 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and merger related expenses of $60 million in 2003. There were no merger related expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.43 billion in 2005, down 1% from $1.44 billion in 2004. Included in 2004s operating expenses was the $25 million charitable contribution already discussed. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1% from 2004. That increase from 2004 resulted from higher costs of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and increased professional services expenses, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.31 billion in 2003. A significant portion of the increase in noninterest expense in 2004 as compared with 2003 was due to operations associated with Allfirst, specifically, the inclusion of twelve months of Allfirst related expenses in 2004 compared with nine months of similar expenses in 2003, and to the $25 million charitable contribution made in 2004. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense and a summary of 2003s merger related expenses. Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $822 million in 2005, 2% higher than $807 million in 2004. Expenses related to providing employee health care and retirement benefits were the most significant contributors to the rise in salaries and benefits from 2004 to 2005. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $740 million in 2003. The full year impact of expenses related to the acquired operations of Allfirst was the leading contributor to the rise in salaries and employee benefits costs in 2004 as compared with 2003. The Company recognizes expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting for all stock based compensation granted to employees after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included $45 million, $48 million and $43 million, respectively, of stock based compensation. The number of full time equivalent employees was 12,780 at December 31, 2005, compared with 12,678 and 13,305 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pension benefit expense is a significant cost to the Company and totaled $38 million in 2005, $30 million in 2004 and $24 million in 2003. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. These assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of these assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment. The Companys 2005 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long term rate of return on assets of 8.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.90%; and a discount rate of 6.00%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on 57 plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $1 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $4 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance promulgated in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, reflects the long term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $155 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $5 million in 2005 and $2 million in each of 2004 and 2003. Reflecting declines in the discount rate used to value pension plan obligations from 6.25% at December 31, 2003 to 6.00% at December 31, 2004 and 5.50% at December 31, 2005, the accumulated benefit obligation of certain of the Companys pension plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $208 million at December 31, 2005 and $116 million at December 31, 2004. The lower discount rate resulted from declines in market rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period for payment of pension benefits. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, the Company was required to have a recorded pension liability for those plans that was at least equal to $208 million at December 31, 2005 and $116 million at December 31, 2004. As a result, as of December 31, 2005 the Company increased its previously recorded pension liability by $60 million with a corresponding reduction of other comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $37 million. A combination of lower than expected investment returns on plan assets during 2005 and a 50 basis point decline in the discount rate assumption to 5.50% were the significant factors contributing to the need for an additional charge to other comprehensive income in 2005. A further 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2005 to 5.25% would have resulted in increases in the accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations of all pension plans of an additional $23 million. Under that scenario, the incremental minimum pension liability adjustment in 2005 would have been $83 million rather than the $60 million that was actually recorded, and the additional after tax effect charge to other comprehensive income in 2005 would have been $51 million. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 5.75% would have decreased the accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations of all pension plans by $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the incremental minimum pension liability adjustment in 2005 would have been $36 million rather than the $60 million actually recorded and the additional after tax effect charge to other comprehensive income in 2005 would have been $22 million rather than $37 million. The Company did not make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2004 or 2005. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a career average pay formula as opposed to the previous final average pay formula. The amendments affect benefits earned for service periods beginning after December 31, 2005. Active participants had the choice of electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined contribution pension plan, the Company will make contributions to the plan each year in an 58 amount that is based on an individual participants total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants will not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. New employees will not be eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but will participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million. There was no effect on the accumulated benefit obligation. The financial impact from these changes to the results of operations for 2005 was not material. In addition to the changes described above, the Company also amended its retirement savings plan (RSP), effective January 1, 2006. The RSP is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 15% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. The RSP was amended to allow eligible employees to defer up to 50% of total compensation as defined above in connection with the defined contribution pension plan. RSP expense totaled $17 million in 2005, $16 million in 2004 and $15 million in 2003. As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined contribution pension plan, the Company hopes to limit increases in future period expenses associated with these plans. Reflecting the impact of these changes, the Company projects that expenses in 2006 associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP will not be materially different than the aggregate amount of expense recognized in 2005 for the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP. Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses aggregated $606 million in 2005, 4% below $634 million in 2004. Excluding the previously mentioned $25 million charitable contribution in 2004, nonpersonnel operating expenses decreased $3 million from 2004. As compared with 2004, a $7 million higher reversal in 2005 of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, and lower equipment, net occupancy and other operating expenses were partially offset by higher professional services costs. The higher expenses incurred for professional services in 2005 were due in part to several initiatives of the Company, including projects focusing on procurement practices, consolidation of loan application systems, revenue enhancement opportunities and operational efficiencies, as well as costs related to the already discussed subordinated note exchange. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $578 million in 2003. The full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition was a significant contributor to the higher expense levels during 2004 as compared with 2003, when only nine months of Allfirst related operating expenses were incurred. Also contributing to that increase in expenses in 2004 was the $25 million charitable contribution and higher expenses for amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and professional services. Partially offsetting those higher expenses were lower charges for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. In 2004, a $4 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights was recognized, while in 2003 a provision for impairment of $2 million was recorded. Those adjustments to the valuation allowance resulted from changes in the estimated fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights that reflect the impact of changing interest rates on the expected rate of residential mortgage loan prepayments. Information about the assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the estimated impact of changes in those assumptions are included in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $389 million in 2005, compared with $344 million in 2004 and $277 million in 2003. The effective tax rates were 33.2%, 32.3% and 32.5% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 was largely due to the impact of the third quarter 2004 reorganization of two of the Companys subsidiaries that altered the taxable status of such subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions thereby decreasing the Companys effective state income tax rate for 2004. As a result of the reorganizations, both income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2004 were reduced by $12 million. The effective tax rate in future 59 periods will be affected by the results of operations attributable to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates and any changes in income tax regulations or interpretations of such regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $230 million at December 31, 2005 and $248 million at December 31, 2004. Such assets included $217 million and $230 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. The most significant funding source for the Company has historically been core deposits, which are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 57% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2005, compared with 59% and 67% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLB and others. M&T Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLB aggregating $6.4 billion at December 31, 2005. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York totaling approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2005 or 2004. The Company has, from time to time, issued subordinated capital notes to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes with a par value of $409 million due 2020. The new notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at M&Ts option, subject to regulatory approval. No new funding was received as a result of the exchange. A more detailed description of the exchange is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/ Lending and Funding Activities and in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, in anticipation of the Allfirst acquisition, M&T Bank issued $400 million of subordinated notes on March 31, 2003 to provide liquidity to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to AIB and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately 60 $572 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings aggregated $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In general, these borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. Offshore branch deposits have been used as an alternative to short term borrowings, as noted earlier, and such deposits outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 totaled $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, and generally matured on the next business day. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 13. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time to time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $58 million and $14 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the total amount of VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds. 61 Table 14 MATURITY DISTRIBUTION OF SELECTED LOANS(a) December 31, 2005 Demand 2006 2007 2010 After 2010 (In thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc. $ 5,180,326 $ 1,069,356 $ 3,002,783 $ 526,935 Real estate construction 232,509 1,348,799 670,325 78,908 Total $ 5,412,835 $ 2,418,155 $ 3,673,108 $ 605,843 Floating or adjustable interest rates $ 2,900,198 $ 418,606 Fixed or predetermined interest rates 772,910 187,237 Total $ 3,673,108 $ 605,843 (a) The data do not include nonaccrual loans. The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2005 are summarized in table 15. Liquidity may be affected by off balance sheet commitments to customers, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2005 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments. 62 Table 15 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS Less Than One One to Three Three to Five Over Five December 31, 2005 Year Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Payments due for contractual obligations Time deposits $ 8,131,857 $ 2,836,849 $ 287,729 $ 151,191 $ 11,407,626 Deposits at foreign office 2,809,532 2,809,532 Federal funds purchased and agreements to repurchase securities 4,211,978 4,211,978 Other short term borrowings 940,894 940,894 Long term borrowings 611,273 2,827,927 922,778 1,835,016 6,196,994 Operating leases 45,971 81,505 55,392 96,346 279,214 Other 25,591 13,858 10,302 41,050 90,801 Total $ 16,777,096 $ 5,760,139 $ 1,276,201 $ 2,123,603 $ 25,937,039 Other commitments Commitments to extend credit $ 6,527,471 $ 3,313,413 $ 3,794,994 $ 1,602,506 $ 15,238,384 Standby letters of credit 1,386,169 1,330,319 673,836 132,910 3,523,234 Commercial letters of credit 21,360 5,056 20,944 47,360 Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts 134,632 71,265 93,526 886,962 1,186,385 Commitments to sell real estate loans 1,164,360 1,164,360 Total $ 9,233,992 $ 4,720,053 $ 4,583,300 $ 2,622,378 $ 21,159,723 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, at December 31, 2005 approximately $528 million was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2004. 63 On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not currently anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.

The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and non parallel shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $652 million. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. Management has taken actions, when deemed prudent, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 65 Table 18 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. Table 18 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES Calculated Increase (Decrease) in Projected Net Interest Income December 31 Changes in Interest Rates 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) +200 basis points $ (7,178 ) $ (20,848 ) +100 basis points (4,096 ) (8,228 ) 100 basis points (5,733 ) 12,386 200 basis points (16,184 ) 4,900 The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. 66 Table 19 CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA Three Months Four to One to After December 31, 2005 or Less Twelve Months Five Years Five Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Loans and leases, net $ 20,392,807 $ 3,594,829 $ 9,692,421 $ 6,650,588 $ 40,330,645 Money market assets 120,586 700 150 121,436 Investment securities 3,756,845 859,831 1,220,223 2,563,265 8,400,164 Total earning assets 24,270,238 4,455,360 10,912,794 9,213,853 48,852,245 NOW accounts 901,938 901,938 Savings deposits 13,839,150 13,839,150 Time deposits 5,525,813 4,336,397 1,492,526 52,890 11,407,626 Deposits at foreign office 2,808,216 1,316 2,809,532 Total interest bearing deposits 23,075,117 4,337,713 1,492,526 52,890 28,958,246 Short term borrowings 5,152,872 5,152,872 Long term borrowings 3,275,266 58,867 1,448,731 1,414,130 6,196,994 Total interest bearing liabilities 31,503,255 4,396,580 2,941,257 1,467,020 40,308,112 Interest rate swaps (602,241 ) 405,000 20,000 177,241 Periodic gap $ (7,835,258 ) $ 463,780 $ 7,991,537 $ 7,924,074 Cumulative gap (7,835,258 ) (7,371,478 ) 620,059 8,544,133 Cumulative gap as a % of total earning assets (16.0 )% (15.1 )% 1.3 % 17.5 % The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities. The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $6.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were $679 million and $512 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were $192 million and $77 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $160 million and $94 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $41 million and $40 million, respectively, related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading 67 account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $48 million and $49 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2005 was $5.9 billion or 10.66% of total assets, compared with $5.7 billion or 10.82% at December 31, 2004 and $5.7 billion or 11.47% at December 31, 2003. On a per share basis, stockholders equity was $52.39 at the 2005 year end, 5% higher than $49.68 at December 31, 2004 and 10% above $47.55 at December 31, 2003. Tangible equity per share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $25.91 at December 31, 2005, compared with $23.62 and $21.97 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented in table 2. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.71%, 11.07% and 10.89% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. To complete the acquisition of Allfirst on April 1, 2003, M&T issued 26,700,000 shares of common stock to AIB resulting in an addition to stockholders equity of $2.0 billion. The value ascribed to the common shares issued to AIB was based on the market value of M&T common stock at the time the terms of the merger were agreed to and announced by M&T and AIB. Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges; and minimum pension liability adjustments. Net unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities were $49 million, or $.43 per common share, at December 31, 2005, compared with losses of $5 million, or $.04 per common share, at December 31, 2004 and gains of $38 million, or $.32 per common share, at December 31, 2003. Such unrealized gains or losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003. The minimum pension liability adjustment, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $49 million at December 31, 2005 and by $12 million at each of December 31, 2004 and 2003, or by $.44 per share, $.11 per share and $.10 per share on those respective dates. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Cash dividends paid in 2005 on M&Ts common stock aggregated $199 million, compared with $188 million and $135 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in 2004s first quarter from $.30 per share to $.40 per share, and again in the second quarter of 2005 to $.45 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $1.75 in 2005, up 9% from $1.60 in 2004 and 46% higher than $1.20 in 2003. M&T repurchased 4,891,800 shares of its common stock in 2005 and 6,520,800 shares in 2004, at a cost of $510 million and $610 million, respectively. M&T did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2003, determining instead that it would use the Companys internal generation of capital to support the acquisition of Allfirst. In December 2004, M&T had announced a plan to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. That repurchase plan was completed in December 2005. In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up 68 to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2005, M&T had repurchased a total of 44,700 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $110.36 per share. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2005, core capital included $688 million of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $963 million of subordinated capital notes. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes due 2020. The new notes bear interest at a fixed coupon rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at M&Ts option, subject to regulatory approval. The subordinated note exchange was done primarily to allow preferential regulatory capital treatment for the new notes, as the 8.0% notes due 2010 would not completely qualify as Tier II capital due to limitations when subordinated notes are within five years of maturity. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after tax effect of merger related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 18.50% in 2005, 18.12% in 2004 and 23.35% in 2003. Fourth Quarter Results Net income rose 7% to $205 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 from $192 million in the corresponding quarter of 2004. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.78 and $1.82, respectively, in 2005s final quarter, compared with $1.62 and $1.66, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2004. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2005 were 1.48% and 13.85%, respectively, compared with 1.45% and 13.37%, respectively, in the year earlier period. Net operating income increased to $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 5% from $202 million in 2004s final quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share rose 9% to $1.85 in the recently completed quarter from $1.70 in the fourth quarter of 2004. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.63% and 29.12%, respectively, in the final quarter of 2005, compared with 1.62% and 29.69%, respectively, in the year earlier quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) and $10 million ($.08 per diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2005 and 2004 are provided in table 21. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 2% to $454 million in the recent quarter from $446 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. That growth was the result of a 5% increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $48.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $46.5 billion in the year earlier period. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $40.4 billion, 6% higher than $38.1 billion during 2004s final quarter. A $1.5 billion rise in residential real estate loans, including a $1.0 billion increase in residential real estate loans held for sale, and an $819 million rise in commercial loans were the leading contributors to the growth in average loans outstanding. The yield on earning assets was 6.16% in the last quarter of 2005, up 92 basis points from 5.24% in the fourth quarter of 2004. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 2.98% in the fourth quarter of 2005, 123 basis points higher than 1.75% in the similar period in 2004. The resulting net interest spread was 3.18% in 2005s final quarter, down 31 basis points from 3.49% in the fourth quarter of 2004. That decline reflects the impact of rising short term interest rates in 2005 that increased rates on interest 69 bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earning assets and resulted in a flattening of the yield curve. As a result, the Companys net interest margin declined to 3.69% in the recent quarter from 3.82% in the final quarter of 2004. The provision for credit losses was $23 million during the final three months of 2005, down from $28 million in the year earlier period. Net charge offs of loans were $23 million in 2005s fourth quarter, representing an annualized .22% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $27 million or .29% during the similar 2004 quarter. Other income totaled $249 million in 2005s final quarter, 5% higher than $238 million in the year earlier quarter. Higher mortgage banking revenues and corporate financing advisory fees contributed to that increase. Other expense in the final three months of 2005 increased 2% to $369 million from $362 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in such amounts are expenses considered nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $13 million and $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were up 3%, totaling $356 million in the recently completed quarter, compared with $346 million in 2004s final quarter. Higher costs for employee benefits and professional services were the leading contributors to that increase, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. Operating expenses in the final quarter of 2005 reflect a $6 million reduction in expense resulting from a partial reversal of that valuation allowance, compared with a $222 thousand reduction of such valuation allowance in 2004s fourth quarter. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 was 50.7% and 50.6%, respectively. Table 21 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2005 and 2004. Segment Information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment contributed net income of $219 million in 2005, up 3% from $213 million in 2004. The favorable performance was due mainly to an increase in net interest income of $21 million, largely the result of a 7% increase in loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a $9 million increase in noninterest expenses, due predominantly to higher personnel costs. Net income for this segment totaled $170 million in 2003. The rise in net income in 2004 as compared with 2003 was attributable to higher net interest income of $46 million, service charges on deposit accounts of $9 million, and letter of credit and other credit related fees of $17 million. Included in that growth was the full year impact of the acquired Allfirst related operations in 2004, while 2003 70 included only nine months of such operating results. Higher average loan balances in non Allfirst regions and a $12 million decline in net charge offs also contributed to the higher net income in 2004 as compared with 2003. Partially offsetting those favorable factors were higher salaries, benefits and other noninterest expenses of $32 million, also largely attributable to the full year impact of Allfirst in 2004. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Commercial Real Estate segment contributed $143 million to net income, up 13% from the $126 million earned in 2004. The improvement was due to an increase in net interest income of $19 million that resulted from higher average loan balances and a wider margin associated with deposits, a $4 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues and a lower provision for credit losses of $5 million. Net income in 2004 for the Commercial Real Estate segment was 11% above the $114 million earned in 2003. The improvement was due to higher net interest income of $20 million, primarily due to higher loan balances outstanding of $608 million, or 9%, largely the result of growth in the markets already served by the Company and also reflecting the full year impact of balances obtained in the Allfirst acquisition. Also contributing to the improved performance were higher commercial mortgage banking revenues of $5 million and increased letter of credit and other credit related fees. The higher revenues were offset, in part, by a $13 million increase in noninterest expenses, largely the result of the full year impact of salaries, benefits and other noninterest expenses related to the business obtained from Allfirst. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC owned by the Company. As previously mentioned, included in the 2005 results was a $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to those preferred stock issuances. As a result, this segments net income of $93 million in 2005 was down 17% from $112 million in 2004. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $82 million in 2003. The 36% increase in net income from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to a $40 million increase in net interest income resulting from higher average earning assets. The primary contributor to those higher earning assets was growth in the investment securities portfolio, due largely to purchases of residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations during 2004 and the full year impact of the retention of mortgage backed securities related to the fourth quarter 2003 securitization of $1.2 billion of residential real estate loans. Also contributing to the favorable performance was a $2 million partial reversal during 2004 of a valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, compared with a $2 million addition to such allowance in 2003. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the southern and western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segments net income increased by 50% to $43 million in 2005 from $29 million in 2004. That improvement was due predominantly to higher noninterest revenues of $20 million, resulting from loan origination, sales and servicing activities, and higher net interest income of $10 million, attributable primarily to an increase in average loan balances outstanding. As mentioned 71 earlier, in May 2005 M&T Mortgage Corporation assumed the operations of Regions Financial Corporations wholesale residential mortgage business. Those operations added 13 locations and approximately 140 employees to M&T Mortgage Corporations business. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors relating to the assumed operations aggregated approximately $1.7 billion in 2005. Including the effect of expenses, the operations assumed did not have a material impact on net income. Also contributing to the segments improved performance was the effect of an $8 million partial reversal of the capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance recognized during 2005, compared with a $2 million partial reversal of such allowance recognized during 2004. Partially offsetting revenue growth was a $14 million increase in salaries and benefits expenses. Net income in 2004 for this segment was 57% lower than the $67 million earned in 2003. This unfavorable variance reflects a $75 million decrease in revenues, due primarily to a lower level of loan originations in 2004 as compared with 2003. The higher origination activity in 2003 reflected the impact of historically low levels of interest rates during that year that produced a favorable environment for consumers to participate in origination and refinancing activities. Also contributing to the decline in revenues was the previously noted $6 million impact of the adoption of SAB No. 105. Partially offsetting the decline in revenues was a $9 million decrease in salaries and benefits expenses reflecting the lower loan originations in 2004. Gains from the sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $10 million, $9 million, and $22 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels which include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $325 million in 2005, up 30% from $251 in 2004. The favorable performance was due mainly to increases in net interest income of $81 million, driven largely by an increase in net interest margin attributable to deposit products. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $21 million, lower noninterest expenses of $13 million, and a $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses also contributed to the rise in net income. In 2003, the Retail Banking segment contributed net income of $206 million. The 22% increase from 2003 to 2004 was due largely to increases in net interest income of $59 million and service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $54 million, offset, in part, by higher expenses of $51 million, all substantially related to the acquired Allfirst franchise. A $14 million decline in the provision for credit losses, due to slower growth in indirect automobile loan balances, also contributed to the rise in net income. The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses, and, in 2003, merger related expenses resulting from the Allfirst acquisition. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $41 million, $9 million, and $66 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The higher net loss incurred during 2005 as compared with 2004 resulted largely from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. Noninterest expenses in 2004 were $44 million higher than in 2005, reflecting 2004s $25 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation and a $19 million higher charge for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The 2004 net loss also reflected the $12 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the 72 reorganization of certain of M&Ts subsidiaries. The lower net loss in 2004 as compared with 2003 was largely the result of merger related costs of $60 million in 2003 and the net impact of higher noninterest income and expense in 2004 due to the full year impact of the Allfirst acquisition. Recent Accounting Developments In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), an amendment of SFAS No. 123 which supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123R also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Additionally, in March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107. SAB No. 107 expresses the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies and the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations. SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual reporting periods that begin after June 15, 2005. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company began recognizing expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in SFAS No. 123. Using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS No. 148, which amended SFAS No. 123, financial information for prior periods was restated to reflect the impact of recognizing expense for stock based compensation in those years as well. As required, coincident with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company will begin accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and employees who will become retirement eligible prior to full vesting of the award because the Companys incentive compensation plan allows for vesting at the time an employee retires. Through December 31, 2005, stock based compensation granted to such individuals was expensed over the normal vesting period and any remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized at the time an individual employee actually retired. This change will affect the timing of stock based compensation expense recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2006 and each first quarter thereafter as most of the Companys stock based awards are granted in January, but will not affect the fair value of stock based compensation granted to employees nor the aggregate amount of stock based compensation expense recognized by the Company. Had M&T recognized compensation costs under the new approach in 2005, the effect would not have been material to the consolidated financial statements for that year. The Company estimates the impact of such change will be to increase salaries and employee benefits expense by approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2006 and by approximately $4 million for the year ending December 31, 2006, as compared to what otherwise would have been recognized had the expense recognition not been accelerated. If not for this required change, the estimated $4 million of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in 2006 would have been recognized in 2007 through 2009 following the normal vesting schedule for stock options granted by the Company. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of the Companys Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements. 73 Future Factors include changes in interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity; prepayment speeds, loan originations and credit losses; sources of liquidity; common shares outstanding; common stock price volatility; fair value of and number of stock based compensation awards to be issued in future periods; legislation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and or M&T and its subsidiaries individually or collectively; regulatory supervision and oversight, including required capital levels; increasing price and product/service competition by competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost effective basis; the mix of products/services; containing costs and expenses; governmental and public policy changes; protection and validity of intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in large, multi year contracts; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability of financing; financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the Companys future businesses; and material differences in the actual financial results of merger and acquisition activities compared with the Companys expectations, including the full realization of anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general economic and political conditions, either nationally or in the states in which the Company conducts business, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes and trends in the securities markets, and other Future Factors. 74 Table 20 QUARTERLY TRENDS 2005 Quarters 2004 Quarters Fourth Third Second First Fourth Third Second First Earnings and dividends Amounts in thousands, except per share Interest income (taxable equivalent basis) $ 757,654 $ 725,129 $ 680,781 $ 642,441 $ 613,012 $ 587,598 $ 565,090 $ 550,362 Interest expense 303,493 265,576 229,016 196,266 166,755 143,771 126,805 126,829 Net interest income 454,161 459,553 451,765 446,175 446,257 443,827 438,285 423,533 Less: provision for credit losses 23,000 22,000 19,000 24,000 28,000 17,000 30,000 20,000 Other income 248,604 221,494 245,362 234,258 237,559 244,925 232,334 228,151 Less: other expense 369,114 368,250 380,441 367,337 361,922 406,922 357,207 389,967 Income before income taxes 310,651 290,797 297,686 289,096 293,894 264,830 283,412 241,717 Applicable income taxes 101,113 95,348 96,589 95,686 97,624 73,843 94,538 77,997 Taxable equivalent adjustment 4,553 4,375 4,263 4,120 4,065 4,546 4,489 4,230 Net income $ 204,985 $ 191,074 $ 196,834 $ 189,290 $ 192,205 $ 186,441 $ 184,385 $ 159,490 Per common share data Basic earnings $ 1.82 $ 1.68 $ 1.73 $ 1.65 $ 1.66 $ 1.59 $ 1.56 $ 1.33 Diluted earnings 1.78 1.64 1.69 1.62 1.62 1.56 1.53 1.30 Cash dividends $ .45 $ .45 $ .45 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 $ .40 Average common shares outstanding Basic 112,529 113,530 113,949 114,773 115,953 116,897 118,224 119,738 Diluted 115,147 116,200 116,422 117,184 119,010 119,665 120,655 122,316 Performance ratios, annualized Return on Average assets 1.48 % 1.39 % 1.46 % 1.44 % 1.45 % 1.42 % 1.45 % 1.29 % Average common stockholders equity 13.85 % 12.97 % 13.73 % 13.41 % 13.37 % 13.02 % 13.12 % 11.19 % Net interest margin on average earning assets (taxable equivalent basis) 3.69 % 3.76 % 3.78 % 3.83 % 3.82 % 3.85 % 3.92 % 3.92 % Nonperforming loans to total loans and leases, net of unearned discount .39 % .41 % .46 % .46 % .45 % .48 % .51 % .70 % Efficiency ratio(a) 52.49 % 51.94 % 54.58 % 54.00 % 52.95 % 59.08 % 53.27 % 60.07 % Net operating (tangible) results(b) Net operating income (in thousands) $ 212,738 $ 199,577 $ 205,415 $ 199,135 $ 202,215 $ 197,822 $ 196,158 $ 172,423 Diluted net operating income per common share 1.85 1.72 1.76 1.70 1.70 1.65 1.63 1.41 Annualized return on Average tangible assets 1.63 % 1.54 % 1.62 % 1.61 % 1.62 % 1.60 % 1.64 % 1.48 % Average tangible common stockholders equity 29.12 % 27.67 % 29.88 % 29.67 % 29.69 % 29.42 % 30.12 % 26.02 % Efficiency ratio(a) 50.69 % 49.97 % 52.56 % 51.63 % 50.56 % 56.38 % 50.39 % 56.81 % Balance sheet data In millions, except per share Average balances Total assets(c) $ 54,835 $ 54,444 $ 53,935 $ 53,306 $ 52,725 $ 52,170 $ 51,251 $ 49,915 Total tangible assets(c) 51,860 51,461 50,944 50,305 49,647 49,075 48,137 46,781 Earning assets 48,833 48,447 47,931 47,240 46,535 45,874 44,923 43,444 Investment securities 8,302 8,439 8,593 8,573 8,326 8,195 7,943 7,516 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 40,403 39,879 39,229 38,580 38,142 37,611 36,904 35,843 Deposits 37,006 36,708 36,245 35,282 34,768 34,569 33,702 32,856 Stockholders equity(c) 5,873 5,845 5,749 5,723 5,721 5,697 5,654 5,732 Tangible stockholders equity(c) 2,898 2,862 2,758 2,722 2,710 2,675 2,619 2,665 At end of quarter Total assets(c) $ 55,146 $ 54,841 $ 54,482 $ 53,887 $ 52,939 $ 52,887 $ 52,094 $ 50,832 Total tangible assets(c) 52,176 51,863 51,495 50,891 49,869 49,801 48,990 47,708 Earning assets 48,852 48,691 48,341 47,853 46,970 46,454 45,757 44,335 Investment securities 8,400 8,230 8,320 8,679 8,475 8,437 8,161 7,656 Loans and leases, net of unearned discount 40,331 40,335 39,911 39,073 38,398 37,950 37,522 36,515 Deposits 37,100 37,199 37,306 36,293 35,429 34,976 34,954 33,341 Stockholders equity(c) 5,876 5,847 5,838 5,674 5,730 5,710 5,657 5,734 Tangible stockholders equity(c) 2,906 2,869 2,851 2,678 2,724 2,694 2,629 2,674 Equity per common share 52.39 51.81 51.20 49.78 49.68 49.11 48.21 48.17 Tangible equity per common share 25.91 25.42 25.00 23.49 23.62 23.17 22.40 22.47 Market price per common share High $ 112.50 $ 112.50 $ 107.28 $ 108.04 $ 108.75 $ 98.66 $ 92.70 $ 98.65 Low 96.71 103.50 98.75 96.71 95.40 86.80 82.90 88.08 Closing 109.05 105.71 105.16 102.06 107.84 95.70 87.30 89.85 (a) Excludes impact of net securities transactions.
