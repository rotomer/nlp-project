Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading Forward Looking Statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular. In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None Item 2. Properties. Both M&T and M&T Bank maintain their executive offices at One M&T Plaza in Buffalo, New York. This twenty one story headquarters building, containing approximately 278,000 rentable square feet of space, is owned in fee by M&T Bank and was completed in 1967. M&T, M&T Bank and their subsidiaries occupy approximately 78% of the building and the remainder is leased to non affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2006, the cost of this property (including improvements subsequent to the initial construction), net of accumulated depreciation, was $5.2 million. In September 1992, M&T Bank acquired an additional facility in Buffalo, New York with approximately 365,000 rentable square feet of space at a cost of approximately $12 million. Approximately 89% of this facility, known as M&T Center, is occupied by M&T Bank and its subsidiaries, with the remainder leased to non affiliated tenants. At December 31, 2006, the cost of this building (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was $12.0 million. M&T Bank also owns and occupies two separate facilities in the Buffalo area which support certain back office and operations functions of the Company. The total square footage of these facilities approximates 215,000 square feet and their combined cost (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was $17.6 million at December 31, 2006. M&T Bank also owns a facility in Syracuse, New York with approximately 150,000 rentable square feet of space. Approximately 41% of this facility is occupied by M&T Bank.

M&T Bank occupies approximately 38% and 84% of these respective facilities. At December 31, 2006, the cost of these buildings (including improvements subsequent to acquisition), net of accumulated depreciation, was $13.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. No other properties owned by M&T Bank have more than 100,000 square feet of space. The cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, of the Companys premises and equipment is detailed in note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and 24 Table of Contents Supplementary Data. Of the 672 domestic banking offices of the Registrants subsidiary banks at December 31, 2006, 281 are owned in fee and 391 are leased. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. M&T and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability, if any, arising out of litigation pending against M&T or its subsidiaries will be material to M&Ts consolidated financial position, but at the present time is not in a position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on M&Ts consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period.

See cross reference sheet for disclosures incorporated elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $57.1 billion at December 31, 2006. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.). M&T Bank, with total assets of $56.4 billion at December 31, 2006, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 671 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. On January 2, 2007, M&T Bank opened its first banking office in New Jersey. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although residential real estate loans are originated through lending offices in 22 states. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency. Effective January 1, 2007, M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company wholly owned by M&T Bank, was merged into M&T Bank. M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $511 million at December 31, 2006, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. 29 Table of Contents On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million in loans, mostly to consumers, small businesses and middle market customers, and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits. M&Ts financial results for 2006 reflect the impact of that transaction from the acquisition date through December 31, 2006. Expenses associated with integrating the acquired branches into M&T Bank and introducing the customers associated with those branches to M&T Banks products and services aggregated $3 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company does not expect that any significant additional acquisition and integration related expenses will be incurred. Including the impact of acquisition related expenses and the amortization of core deposit intangible resulting from the transaction, net income and diluted earnings per share of the Company in 2006 were reduced by approximately $10 million and $.09, respectively, as a result of the transaction. As of December 31, 2006, there were no significant amounts of unpaid acquisition related expenses. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview Net income for the Company in 2006 was $839 million or $7.37 of diluted earnings per common share, up 7% and 10%, respectively, from $782 million or $6.73 of diluted earnings per share in 2005. Basic earnings per common share rose 10% to $7.55 in 2006 from $6.88 in 2005. Net income in 2004 totaled $723 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $6.00 and $6.14, respectively. The after tax impact of acquisition and integration related expenses (included herein as merger related expenses) associated with the June 30 branch acquisition already discussed was $3 million ($5 million pre tax) or $.03 of basic and diluted earnings per share in 2006. There were no similar expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2006 was 1.50%, compared with 1.44% in 2005 and 1.40% in 2004. The return on average common stockholders equity was 13.89% in 2006, 13.49% in 2005 and 12.67% in 2004. Net interest income recorded on a taxable equivalent basis increased 1% to $1.84 billion in 2006 from $1.81 billion in 2005. The impact of a higher level of average earning assets was largely offset by a decline in the Companys net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Average earning assets rose 3% to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005, the result of increased balances of loans and leases, offset, in part, by a decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities. Average loans and leases of $41.4 billion in 2006 were $1.9 billion or 5% higher than $39.5 billion in 2005, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $863 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of $755 million, or 5%, and consumer real estate loans of $1.1 billion, or 28%, partially offset by an $804 million, or 7% decline in consumer loans and leases. Average balances of investment securities decreased 5% to $8.0 billion in 2006 from $8.5 billion in 2005. The net interest margin declined 7 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005, largely due to higher short term interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate 100 basis points during the first six months of 2006, continuing a trend of rate increases that began in June 2004. Such interest rate increases had the effect of increasing rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earning assets during 2005 and the first half of 2006. During the last six months of 2006, the Companys net interest margin stabilized as compared to the first half of the year. As a result of higher average earning assets, taxable equivalent net interest income in 2005 was 3% higher than $1.75 billion in 2004. Average earning assets in 2005 rose 6% from $45.2 billion in 2004. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2005 were up $2.4 billion, or 6%, from $37.1 billion in 2004, largely due to growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and consumer real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer loans and leases. Net interest margin in 2005 declined 11 basis points from 3.88% in 2004, largely due to the rising interest rate environment which resulted in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than yields on earning assets. 31 Table of Contents The provision for credit losses declined to $80 million in 2006 from $88 million in 2005 and $95 million in 2004. The reduced levels of the provision during the past two years as compared with 2004 were reflective of generally favorable credit quality. Net charge offs were $68 million in 2006, down from $77 million in 2005 and $82 million in 2004. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding decreased to .16% in 2006 from .19% in 2005 and .22% in 2004. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans. While most credit quality measures improved from 2004 to 2005, the Company did experience an increase in nonperforming loans during the second half of 2006, due largely to the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers. Noninterest income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006 from $950 million in 2005. Higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Included in noninterest income in 2006 was a $13 million gain resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. Losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a $29 million non cash, other than temporary impairment charge in the third quarter related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses in both years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006, noninterest income rose 5% from 2005 to 2006. Noninterest income totaled $943 million in 2004. Comparing 2005 with 2004, higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues were largely offset by the $29 million impairment charge in 2005. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Noninterest expense in 2006 aggregated $1.55 billion, up 4% from $1.49 billion in 2005. Noninterest expense in 2004 was $1.52 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million, $57 million and $75 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and merger related expenses of $5 million in 2006. As already noted, there were no merger related expenses in 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.48 billion in 2006, $1.43 billion in 2005 and $1.44 billion in 2004. Included in operating expenses in 2006 and 2004 were tax deductible contributions made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt private charitable foundation, of $18 million and $25 million, respectively. There was no similar contribution made in 2005. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased $37 million, or 3%, from 2005. The most significant contributor to that increase was a higher level of salaries expense, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases and higher stock based compensation costs and other incentive pay. Excluding the impact of the $25 million charitable contribution in 2004, noninterest operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. That slight increase reflects higher costs of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and higher professional services expenses offset, in part, by a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates. The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 51.5% in 2006, compared with 51.2% in 2005 and 53.5% in 2004. 32 Table of Contents Table 1 EARNINGS SUMMARY Dollars in millions Compound Increase (Decrease)(a) Growth Rate 2005 to 2006 2004 to 2005 5 Years Amount % Amount % 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 to 2006 $ 527.8 19 $ 489.9 21 Interest income(b) $ 3,333.8 2,806.0 2,316.1 2,142.9 1,856.1 9 % 502.2 51 430.2 76 Interest expense 1,496.6 994.4 564.2 527.8 594.5 10 25.6 1 59.7 3 Net interest income(b) 1,837.2 1,811.6 1,751.9 1,615.1 1,261.6 9 (8.0 ) (9 ) (7.0 ) (7 ) Less: provision for credit losses 80.0 88.0 95.0 131.0 122.0 (5 ) 30.7 (31.0 ) Gain (loss) on bank investment securities 2.6 (28.1 ) 2.9 2.5 (.6 ) 65.4 7 37.7 4 Other income 1,043.2 977.8 940.1 828.6 512.5 17 Less: 51.1 6 15.6 2 Salaries and employee benefits 873.3 822.2 806.6 740.3 497.0 13 15.5 2 (46.6 ) (7 ) Other expense 678.4 662.9 709.5 708.0 464.6 6 63.1 5 104.4 10 Income before income taxes 1,251.3 1,188.2 1,083.8 866.9 689.9 17 Less: 2.4 14 Taxable equivalent adjustment(b) 19.7 17.3 17.3 16.3 14.0 2 3.7 1 44.7 13 Income taxes 392.4 388.7 344.0 276.7 219.1 15 $ 57.0 7 $ 59.7 8 Net income $ 839.2 782.2 722.5 573.9 456.8 19 % (a) Changes were calculated from unrounded amounts. (b) Interest income data are on a taxable equivalent basis. The taxable equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 39% for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2002, and 36% for 2003. Supplemental Reporting of Non GAAP Results of Operations As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006, $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2004. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $38 million, $35 million and $46 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, in which M&T excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with integrating acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Net operating income increased 8% to $881 million in 2006 from $817 million in 2005. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2006 rose 10% to $7.73 from $7.03 in 2005. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share were $769 million and $6.38, respectively, during 2004. Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share are presented in table 2. Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.67% in 2006, compared with 1.60% in 2005 and 1.59% in 2004. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 29.55% in 2006, improved from 29.06% and 28.76% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Reconciliations of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity are also presented in table 2.

Average earning assets increased 3% to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005. That growth resulted from a 5% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases of $1.9 billion, offset in part by a 5% decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities of $441 million. The positive impact of higher average earning assets on taxable equivalent net interest income was largely offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005. Average loans and leases outstanding aggregated $41.4 billion in 2006, up 5% from $39.5 billion in 2005. The higher average outstanding loan balances were the result of growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans. Average commercial loans and leases rose 8% to $11.3 billion in 2006 from $10.5 billion in 2005. Commercial real estate loans averaged $15.1 billion during 2006, 5% higher than $14.3 billion in 2005, reflecting a $336 million rise in construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The Companys residential real estate loan portfolio averaged $5.0 billion in 2006, up 28% from $3.9 billion in 2005. Included in that portfolio were loans held for sale, which averaged $1.5 billion in 2006, 19% above the $1.2 billion averaged in 2005. Excluding such loans, average residential real estate loans increased $861 million from 2005 to 2006. That increase was largely the result of the Companys decision to retain higher levels of residential real estate loans having certain characteristics, due to narrowing margins available in the marketplace when selling such loans and the lack of availability of investment securities to acquire that met the Companys desired characteristics and provided suitable returns. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.0 billion in 2006, down 7% from $10.8 billion in 2005. That decline was the result of lower average balances of automobile loans and leases, which decreased 22% to $2.9 billion in 2006 from $3.7 billion in 2005, reflecting the Companys decision to allow such balances to decline rather than matching interest rates offered by competitors. During late 2006, the interest rate environment relating to the Companys automobile lending business improved and from September 30 to December 31, outstanding balances of such loans increased slightly. 35 Table of Contents Table 3 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT RATES 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate (Average balance in millions; interest in thousands) Assets Earning assets Loans and leases, net of unearned discount(a) Commercial, financial, etc. $ 11,319 $ 802,451 7.09 % 10,455 589,644 5.64 % 9,534 410,258 4.30 % 8,523 358,629 4.21 % 5,146 261,867 5.09 % Real estate commercial 15,096 1,104,518 7.32 14,341 941,017 6.56 13,264 763,134 5.75 11,573 706,022 6.10 9,498 661,382 6.96 Real estate consumer 5,015 319,858 6.38 3,925 235,364 6.00 3,111 184,125 5.92 3,777 232,454 6.15 4,087 285,055 6.98 Consumer 10,003 712,484 7.12 10,808 664,509 6.15 11,220 626,255 5.58 10,098 607,909 6.02 6,776 467,167 6.89 Total loans and leases, net 41,433 2,939,311 7.09 39,529 2,430,534 6.15 37,129 1,983,772 5.34 33,971 1,905,014 5.61 25,507 1,675,471 6.57 Interest bearing deposits at banks 12 372 3.01 10 169 1.64 13 65 .51 14 147 1.03 6 76 1.32 Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities 81 5,597 6.91 23 808 3.55 8 134 1.60 147 1,875 1.28 272 4,455 1.63 Trading account 90 2,446 2.71 80 1,544 1.92 53 418 .79 55 647 1.18 13 247 1.86 Investment securities(b) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 2,884 121,669 4.22 3,479 134,528 3.87 4,169 158,953 3.81 2,599 106,209 4.09 1,292 81,412 6.30 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 157 10,223 6.53 180 10,860 6.04 218 15,017 6.90 251 15,827 6.30 279 17,828 6.40 Other 4,995 254,142 5.09 4,817 227,562 4.72 3,610 157,703 4.37 2,494 113,159 4.54 1,552 76,659 4.94 Total investment securities 8,036 386,034 4.80 8,476 372,950 4.40 7,997 331,673 4.15 5,344 235,195 4.40 3,123 175,899 5.63 Total earning assets 49,652 3,333,760 6.71 48,118 2,806,005 5.83 45,200 2,316,062 5.13 39,531 2,142,878 5.42 28,921 1,856,148 6.42 Allowance for credit losses (646 ) (638 ) (626 ) (574 ) (438 ) Cash and due from banks 1,346 1,400 1,599 1,542 732 Other assets 5,487 5,255 5,344 4,850 2,720 Total assets $ 55,839 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities Interest bearing deposits NOW accounts $ 435 3,461 .79 400 2,182 .55 550 1,802 .33 1,021 3,613 .35 761 3,900 .51 Savings deposits 14,401 201,543 1.40 14,889 139,445 .94 15,305 92,064 .60 13,278 102,190 .77 8,899 107,281 1.21 Time deposits 12,420 551,514 4.44 9,158 294,782 3.22 6,948 154,722 2.23 6,638 159,700 2.41 7,398 237,001 3.20 Deposits at foreign office 3,610 178,348 4.94 3,819 120,122 3.15 3,136 43,034 1.37 1,445 14,991 1.04 569 8,460 1.49 Total interest bearing deposits 30,866 934,866 3.03 28,266 556,531 1.97 25,939 291,622 1.12 22,382 280,494 1.25 17,627 356,642 2.02 Short term borrowings 4,530 227,850 5.03 4,890 157,853 3.23 5,142 71,172 1.38 4,331 49,064 1.13 3,125 52,723 1.69 Long term borrowings 6,013 333,836 5.55 6,411 279,967 4.37 5,832 201,366 3.45 6,018 198,252 3.29 4,162 185,149 4.45 Total interest bearing liabilities 41,409 1,496,552 3.61 39,567 994,351 2.51 36,913 564,160 1.53 32,731 527,810 1.61 24,914 594,514 2.39 Noninterest bearing deposits 7,555 8,050 8,039 6,801 3,618 Other liabilities 834 720 864 876 377 Total liabilities 49,798 48,337 45,816 40,408 28,909 Stockholders equity 6,041 5,798 5,701 4,941 3,026 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 55,839 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 Net interest spread 3.10 3.32 3.60 3.81 4.03 Contribution of interest free funds .60 .45 .28 .28 .33 Net interest income/margin on earning assets $ 1,837,208 3.70 % 1,811,654 3.77 % 1,751,902 3.88 % 1,615,068 4.09 % 1,261,634 4.36 % (a) Includes nonaccrual loans.

That improvement reflected a 6% increase in average earning assets to $48.1 billion in 2005 from $45.2 billion in 2004, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004. The growth in average earning assets reflects higher average loans and leases outstanding, which rose 6% to $39.5 billion in 2005 from 2004s average of $37.1 billion, and higher average investment securities balances, which also increased 6% to $8.5 billion in 2005 from $8.0 billion in 2004. The Company experienced growth in most major loan categories during 2005 as compared with 2004. Average commercial loans and leases rose 10% to $10.5 billion in 2005 from $9.5 billion in 2004, reflecting, in part, a $212 million rise in average automobile floor plan loans outstanding. Commercial real estate loans averaged $14.3 billion during 2005, 8% higher than $13.3 billion in 2004. Contributing to that increase were $467 million of higher average balances of construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Average residential real estate loan balances rose 26% to $3.9 billion in 2005 from $3.1 billion in 2004. A higher level of loans held for sale was the most significant contributor to that increase. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.8 billion during 2005, down 4% from $11.2 billion in 2004. Average balances of automobile loans and leases decreased 16% to $3.7 billion in 2005 from $4.4 billion in 2004, largely due to unfavorable rates being offered by competitors. Partially offsetting the drop in automobile loan and lease balances was a 13% rise in average outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit to $4.0 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004. Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2006 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Table 5 presents information on such commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2006 relating to geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $11.7 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2006, approximately $9.7 billion, or 83%, were secured, while 49%, 26% and 13% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2006 aggregated $1.2 billion, of which 41% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 13% were secured by collateral in Maryland and another 13% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania. 37 Table of Contents International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $176 million and $217 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these programs at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $143 million and $200 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, the Company held approximately $15.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $6.0 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties (including $1.9 billion of loans held for sale) and $5.4 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $14.5 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005. A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally 38 Table of Contents considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction loans, adjustable rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 41% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2006. Of the $5.1 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 31% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 40% by retail space and 8% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 45% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $15 million made up approximately 24% of the total. 39 Table of Contents Table 6 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS (Net of unearned discount) December 31, 2006 Percent of Dollars Outstanding by Loan Size Outstandings $0 1 $1 5 $5 10 $10 15 $15+ (Dollars in millions) Metropolitan New York City Apartments/Multifamily $ 1,602 3 % 14 % 6 % 3 % 5 % Office 402 1 2 2 1 2 Retail/Services 2,020 3 14 8 4 11 Construction 315 2 1 1 2 Industrial 213 1 1 1 1 Other 561 1 3 3 1 3 Total Metropolitan New York City 5,113 9 % 36 % 21 % 10 % 24 % Other New York State Apartments/Multifamily 281 2 % 3 % 1 % 1 % % Office 893 7 9 4 1 3 Retail/Services 935 9 10 4 1 1 Construction 614 2 5 3 1 5 Industrial 408 5 5 1 Other 651 6 6 2 2 1 Total other New York State 3,782 31 % 38 % 15 % 6 % 10 % Pennsylvania Apartments/Multifamily 265 3 % 3 % 1 % 2 % 1 % Office 397 6 5 2 2 Retail/Services 547 7 9 2 2 1 Construction 286 1 5 3 1 1 Industrial 366 4 6 2 2 Other 746 16 11 2 Total Pennsylvania 2,607 37 % 39 % 12 % 7 % 5 % Maryland Apartments/Multifamily 31 1 % 1 % % % % Office 390 8 7 4 3 Retail/Services 219 4 3 3 1 1 Construction 585 1 8 10 3 10 Industrial 190 3 5 1 1 Other 401 9 7 2 1 3 Total Maryland 1,816 26 % 31 % 20 % 6 % 17 % Other Apartments/Multifamily 141 1 % 3 % 2 % 1 % % Office 122 1 1 2 1 1 Retail/Services 503 2 6 7 4 5 Construction 956 10 11 8 4 12 Industrial 149 1 3 1 2 Other 228 2 4 4 1 Total other 2,099 17 % 28 % 24 % 13 % 18 % Total commercial real estate loans $ 15,417 22 % 35 % 18 % 9 % 16 % 40 Table of Contents Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 69% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 76% and 57%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 14% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2006. Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6 totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006, or 6% of total loans and leases. Approximately 97% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2006 were $1.1 billion of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multi family residential housing, retail space and other commercial development. M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by FNMA and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one third of the outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $939 million and $941 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2006 and 2005 aggregated $49 million and $199 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties were $6.0 billion at December 31, 2006, including approximately 31% secured by properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 9% secured by properties located in Maryland. At December 31, 2006, $1.9 billion of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $693 million at December 31, 2006, or approximately 2% of total loans and leases, compared with $583 million or 1% at December 31, 2005. Consumer loans and leases comprised approximately 24% of the average loan portfolio during 2006, down from 27% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans and leases. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 10% of average loans outstanding in 2006 and 2005. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 7% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2006, down from 9% in 2005. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2006. Approximately 54% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006 were secured by properties in New York State, and 18% and 22% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were $4.2 billion in 2006, up 5% from $4.0 billion in 2005. The Company continues to pursue growing the home equity portfolio, which has historically experienced a lower level of credit losses than other types of consumer loans. However, the rate of growth from 2005 to 2006 slowed, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on this portfolio of predominantly variable interest rate loans. At December 31, 2006, 30% and 32% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are 41 Table of Contents subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Since mid 2004, the Company has experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business, resulting from increased competition from other lenders, including financing incentives offered by automobile manufacturers. Throughout that period, the Company chose not to match the pricing being offered by many competitors. During late 2006 the interest rate environment as it relates to these loans improved such that the outstanding balances in this portfolio increased by $42 million to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006 from September 30, 2006. Automobile leases outstanding averaged approximately $53 million in 2006, compared with $137 million in 2005 and $308 million in 2004. The Company ceased origination of automobile leases during 2003. That decision did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, outstanding automobile leases totaled $29 million and $85 million, respectively. Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2006, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 48% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2006 were to New York State customers, while 21% and 12% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $8.0 billion in 2006 and 2004, compared with $8.5 billion in 2005. The decline in such securities from 2005 to 2006 reflects net paydowns of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The Company has allowed the investment securities portfolio to decline as the opportunity to purchase securities at favorable spreads, that is, the difference 42 Table of Contents between the yield earned on a security and the rate paid on funds used to purchase it, has been limited. The increase in average balances of investment securities from 2004 to 2005 was the result of net purchases in late 2004 and in 2005 consisting largely of collateralized residential mortgage obligations. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company concluded that such declines were temporary in nature. Events occurring during 2005s third quarter resulted in the Company recognizing an other than temporary impairment charge of $29 million related to preferred securities of FNMA and FHLMC. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $183 million in 2006, $113 million in 2005 and $74 million in 2004. The amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Also included in core deposits are certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. Core deposits averaged $28.3 billion in 2006, $27.9 billion in 2005 and $28.1 billion in 2004. The previously discussed June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added approximately $880 million to average core deposits during the second half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for the full year. The rise in average balances of time deposits less than $100,000 in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 as compared with 2004 was partially due to customer response to higher interest rates offered on those products, resulting in a shift of funds from savings and non interest bearing deposit accounts to time deposits. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $387 million in 2006, $216 million in 2005 and $223 million in 2004. Funding provided by core deposits represented 57% of average earning assets in 2006, compared with 58% in 2005 and 62% in 2004. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2006 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Table 8 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2006 2005 to 2006 2004 to 2005 (Dollars in millions) NOW accounts $ 435 9 % (27 )% Savings deposits 14,332 (3 ) (3 ) Time deposits under $100,000 5,983 29 8 Noninterest bearing deposits 7,555 (6 ) Total $ 28,305 1 % (1 )% 43 Table of Contents Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.9 billion in 2006, $1.8 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion in 2004. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $3.6 billion in 2006, $3.8 billion in 2005 and $3.1 billion in 2004. Average brokered time deposits totaled $3.5 billion in 2006, compared with $2.7 billion in 2005 and $1.4 billion in 2004, and at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was 11 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $390 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts, which averaged $69 million, $62 million and $57 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), and others as sources of funding. Short term borrowings averaged $4.5 billion in 2006, $4.9 billion in 2005 and $5.1 billion in 2004. Included in short term borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, and averaged $3.7 billion, $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest component of short term borrowings and are obtained daily from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Also included in short term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average balance of long term borrowings was $6.0 billion in 2006, $6.4 billion in 2005 and $5.8 billion in 2004. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLBs of $3.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and $3.3 billion in 2004, and subordinated capital notes of $1.2 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005 and 2004. M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2006, in part to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. The notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until December 2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in December 2021, at a rate equal to the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .64%. Beginning December 2016, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the notes on any interest payment date. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for $409 million of subordinated notes bearing a fixed coupon rate of interest of 5.585% through December 2015 and a variable rate of interest equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215% from December 2015 to the maturity date in December 2020. Beginning December 2015, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the new notes on any interest payment date. In accordance with GAAP, the Company accounted for the exchange as a modification of debt terms and not as an extinguishment of debt because, among other factors, the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new subordinated notes was not at least ten percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original terms of the exchanged subordinated notes. Coincident with the exchange, M&T Bank terminated $363 million out of a total notional amount of $500 million of interest rate swap agreements that were used to hedge the 8.0% subordinated notes. Under the terms of the swap agreements, the Company pays a variable rate of interest and receives a fixed rate. The Company paid $15 million to terminate the $363 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements. A hedge valuation adjustment of $15 million related to the $363 million of exchanged subordinated notes became part of the carrying value of the new subordinated 44 Table of Contents notes. The remaining portion of that valuation adjustment, which is being amortized to interest expense over the period to expected maturity of the new notes, was $14 million at December 31, 2006. Including the impact of such amortization, the new subordinated notes have an effective rate of 7.76%. The $137 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement that was not terminated continues to hedge the remaining $137 million of 8.0% subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long term borrowings were $712 million, $711 million and $710 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. From June 30, 2004 to June 30, 2006, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate seventeen times, each increase representing a 25 basis point increment over the previously effective target rate. Specifically, during the first half of 2006, four increases were initiated; during 2005, eight increases occurred; and in the second half of 2004, the target federal funds rate was raised five times. In such a rising interest rate environment, rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, most notably short term borrowings, have risen more rapidly than have the yields on earning assets. The result of these conditions was a contraction of the net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, which declined 22 basis points from 3.32% in 2005 to 3.10% in 2006. The yield on earning assets during 2006 was 6.71%, 88 basis points higher than 5.83% in 2005, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 110 basis points to 3.61% from 2.51% in 2005. The yield on the Companys earning assets rose 70 basis points in 2005 from 5.13% in 2004, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2005 was up 98 basis points from 1.53% in 2004. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 3.60% in 2004 to 3.32% in 2005. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest free funds averaged $8.2 billion in 2006, compared with $8.6 billion in 2005 and $8.3 billion in 2004. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.1 billion in 2006 and 2004, and $3.0 billion in 2005. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.1 billion in 2006, $1.0 billion in 2005 and $974 million in 2004. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was .60% in 2006, .45% in 2005 and .28% in 2004. The rise in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2006 and 2005 as compared with the immediately preceding years resulted largely from the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.70% in 2006, compared with 3.77% in 2005 and 3.88% in 2004. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin. Through the second quarter of 2006, the Companys net interest margin had been declining since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in June 2004. During the last half of 2006, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and the Companys net interest margin stabilized. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes at December 31, 2006 was $1.0 billion. Under the terms of these swap 45 Table of Contents agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates. As of December 31, 2006, all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges. Additional information about those swap agreements and the items being hedged is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $15 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates.

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $80 million in 2006, down from $88 million in 2005 and $95 million in 2004. Net loan charge offs declined to $68 million in 2006 from $77 million and $82 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .16% in 2006, compared with .19% in 2005 and .22% in 2004. A summary of the Companys loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.

The increase in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2006 from a year earlier was largely due to the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers totaling approximately $41 million. The lower level of nonperforming loans at the 47 Table of Contents 2005 year end as compared with a year earlier reflects an overall improvement in borrower repayment performance. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $111 million or .26% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2006, compared with $129 million or .32% at December 31, 2005 and $155 million or .40% at December 31, 2004. Those loans included loans guaranteed by government related entities of $77 million, $106 million and $121 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government related entities and totaled $65 million at December 31, 2006, $79 million at December 31, 2005 and $104 million at December 31, 2004. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export Import Bank of the United States that totaled $11 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $26 million and $17 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.

Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Net charge offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $20 million in each of 2006 and 2004, compared with $26 million in 2005. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases were $79 million at December 31, 2006, $39 million a year earlier and $45 million at December 31, 2004. As noted earlier, 48 Table of Contents the increase in such loans from the 2005 year end to December 31, 2006 largely reflects the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers aggregating $41 million. Continued slowing of domestic automobile sales in 2006 has resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results. Net charge offs of commercial real estate loans during 2006 were $1 million, compared with net recoveries of $1 million in 2005 and net charge offs of $3 million in 2004. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming totaled $57 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $44 million at December 31, 2005 and $45 million at December 31, 2004. The increase from the end of 2005 to the 2006 year end was largely due to the addition of a $10 million loan to an assisted living facility. Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries, were $4 million in each of 2006 and 2004, compared with $2 million in 2005. Nonperforming residential real estate loans at the 2006 year end totaled $42 million, compared with $29 million and $44 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $92 million, $96 million and $127 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government related entities. Net charge offs of consumer loans and leases during 2006 totaled $43 million, representing .43% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $50 million or .47% in 2005 and $55 million or .49% in 2004. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Net charge offs of indirect automobile loans and leases were $24 million during 2006, and $37 million during each of 2005 and 2004. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases were $46 million at December 31, 2006, representing .46% of outstanding consumer loans and leases, compared with $44 million or .42% at December 31, 2005 and $38 million or .35% at December 31, 2004. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $3 million at December 31, 2006, $1 million at December 31, 2005 and $2 million at December 31, 2004. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2006 in light of (i) the sluggish pace of economic growth in many of the markets served by the Company; (ii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania; and (iii) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies. Although the national economy experienced moderate growth in 2006 with inflation being reasonably well contained, concerns exist about the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakening housing market, particularly concerns about possible over valued real estate; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans resulting from a higher level of interest rates; 49 Table of Contents sluggish job creation, which could cause consumer spending to slow; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; continued slowing of domestic automobile sales; and modest loan demand in many market areas served by the Company. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following paragraphs describe these components. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories, beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for certain national and local economic conditions have been included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result, probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans, have been included in the inherent base level loss components at December 31, 2006. In evaluating collateral value, the Company relies extensively on internally and externally prepared valuations. Such valuations, in particular commercial real estate valuations, utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City 50 Table of Contents metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes in assigned loan grades due to the elapse of time between the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality and, accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2006. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market was 0.2%, or well below the 1.5% national average. The manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company and in Maryland matched the national average. The results for the Pennsylvania markets are particularly noteworthy since job growth in that region had significantly lagged national averages for several years prior to 2006. Job growth in New York City (1.8%) and the Greater Washington D.C. region (3.0%), particularly northern Virginia (3.6%), was higher than the national average in 2006. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about inflation, higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness, high and volatile energy prices, weak population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions that lagged national population growth trends and other factors, continue to indicate to management an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York and Pennsylvania where more than two thirds of its lending business is conducted. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as; (i) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (ii) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; and (iii) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in table 12. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components, including in 2006, the allocation of losses that were previously unallocated for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations, certain national and local economic conditions, and other factors. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $153 million at December 31, 2006 and $93 million at December 31, 2005. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $23 million at December 31, 2006 and $15 million at December 31, 2005. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .21% and .51% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses from year end 2005 to December 31, 2006 was largely attributable to the factors described herein. Given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and 51 Table of Contents reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Table 12 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES December 31 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc $ 212,945 $ 136,852 $ 147,550 $ 186,902 $ 120,627 Real estate 221,747 161,003 166,910 170,493 152,758 Consumer 124,675 133,541 148,591 152,759 113,711 Unallocated 90,581 206,267 163,813 103,904 49,376 Total $ 649,948 $ 637,663 $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 As a Percentage of Gross Loans and Leases Outstanding Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc 1.79 % 1.23 % 1.45 % 1.99 % 2.23 % Real estate 1.04 .85 .96 1.10 1.17 Consumer 1.26 1.27 1.33 1.37 1.51 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2006 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $650 million or 1.51% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2006, compared with $638 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2005 and $627 million or 1.63% at December 31, 2004. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases from the 2005 year end to December 31, 2006 reflects managements evaluation of the loan portfolio as described herein, including a change in portfolio mix resulting from higher balances of residential real estate loans and lower balances of consumer loans. In general, the Company experiences significantly lower charge off rates on residential real estate loans than on consumer loans. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 also reflects improvement in certain credit factors, including decreases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 290%, 408% and 364%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows the methodology described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality: For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 10 basis point increase in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. 52 Table of Contents For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were: For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5 basis point decrease in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $48 million in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement an $18 million reduction in such losses could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties and properties used in providing retail goods and services in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% and 5%, respectively, of loans outstanding at December 31, 2006. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2006. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $176 million at December 31, 2006, or .4% of total loans and leases. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $9 million and $13 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Income Other income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006 from $950 million in 2005. Higher levels of mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. As discussed previously, included in other income for 2006 was a $13 million gain from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million borrowing from the FHLB of Atlanta. In addition, other income in 2005 reflects the already discussed $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to the Companys investment in certain preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities from both years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006, other income increased 5% from 2005 to 2006. Other income in 2005 was 1% above the $943 million earned in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues were offset by losses from investment securities, which reflect the $29 million impairment charge. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, other income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Mortgage banking revenues were $143 million in 2006, compared with $136 million in 2005 and $124 million in 2004. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities is largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program. Residential mortgage banking revenues, which consist of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, increased 7% to $114 million in 2006 from $107 million in 2005. Higher revenue from servicing residential mortgage loans for others was the leading factor in the improvement. Residential mortgage banking revenues in 2005 were 7% higher than the $100 million earned in 2004. Higher origination activity was the most significant factor contributing to that increase. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $6.4 billion in 2006, compared with $6.5 billion in 2005 and $4.8 billion in 2004. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $41 million in 2006, compared with $42 million in 2005, and $32 million in 2004. On May 1, 2005, the Company assumed the operations of Regions Financial Corporations wholesale residential mortgage business. Those operations added 13 locations and 53 Table of Contents approximately 140 employees to the Companys residential mortgage banking business. Approximately $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion of residential mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005, respectively, for sale to other investors were related to the assumed operations. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others rose to $66 million in 2006 from $58 million in 2005 and $57 million in 2004. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $14 million, $10 million and $6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $16.7 billion at December 31, 2006, $15.6 billion a year earlier and $14.9 billion at December 31, 2004, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $3.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $153 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $140 million and $133 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $36 million, $23 million and $13 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre determined rates were $1.8 billion and $680 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, $923 million and $352 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $764 million and $422 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively, compared with net unrealized losses of $5 million at December 31, 2005. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in a net increase in revenue of $2 million in 2006, and net decreases in revenue of $8 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004. Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $29 million in each of 2006 and 2005, compared with $25 million in 2004. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $15 million in 2006, compared with $14 million during 2005 and $13 million in 2004. Loan servicing revenues totaled $14 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $12 million in 2004. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets totaled $21 million at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and $22 million at December 31, 2004. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $4.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and included $939 million, $941 million and $926 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $115 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, $241 million and $42 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $167 million and $106 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $49 million, $199 million and $61 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 3% to $381 million in 2006 from $370 million in 2005. Deposit account service charges in 2004 were $366 million. The higher levels of such revenues in 2006 and 2005 as compared with the immediately preceding years resulted from increased consumer service charges, largely resulting from higher debit card transaction volumes and overdraft fees, partially offset by lower commercial service charges. Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income rose 5% to $141 million in 2006 from $135 million in 2005, due in part to higher personal trust revenues. Trust income totaled $136 million in 2004. The impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds caused the decline in revenues from 2004 to 2005. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, aggregated $142.4 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $134.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Trust assets under management were $14.8 billion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 54 Table of Contents 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $60 million in 2006, up 8% from $56 million in 2005, primarily the result of increased revenues from the sale of annuities. Brokerage services income was $54 million in 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was due largely to increased revenues earned from the sale of mutual funds. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $25 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $19 million in 2004. The higher gains in 2006 as compared with 2005 resulted largely from net increases in the market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. The increased gains in 2005 as compared with 2004 were due in part to higher volumes of trading assets and liabilities and reflected fees and market value changes related to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $15 million in each of 2006 and 2005, and were $11 million in 2004. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $45 million and $41 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of such assets were $5 million in 2006, $3 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations. Gains on investment securities were $3 million in each of 2006 and 2004, while as a result of the previously described charge for the other than temporary impairment in value of the FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock, losses on investment securities aggregated $28 million during 2005. Other revenues from operations were $293 million in 2006, up from $259 million in 2005 and $240 million in 2004. Significant contributors to the 13% rise in such revenues from 2005 to 2006 were the previously noted $13 million gain from the call of an FHLB borrowing and an increase of $9 million in insurance related revenues, largely the result of the February 1, 2006 acquisition by M&T Bank of a commercial insurance and surety brokerage agency based in Maryland. Also contributing to the increase from 2005 to 2006 were higher income from educational lending services of $8 million and income from bank owned life insurance of $6 million. An increase of $5 million in revenues from providing corporate financing advisory services and a $7 million increase in gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property contributed to the higher revenues in 2005 as compared with 2004. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit related fees totaled $77 million, $75 million and $74 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $53 million, $47 million and $48 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $32 million in 2006, $30 million in 2005 and $28 million in 2004. Insurance related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $32 million in 2006, compared with $22 million in each of 2005 and 2004. The higher revenues in 2006 as compared with the preceding two years was primarily the result of the already noted insurance agency acquisition in February 2006. Automated teller machine (ATM) usage fees aggregated $15 million in 2006, compared with $22 million in 2005 and in 2004. The decrease in such fees in 2006 was largely the result of the reduction or elimination of fees charged for use of ATMs at certain non branch locations. Other Expense Other expense totaled $1.55 billion in 2006, compared with $1.49 billion in 2005 and $1.52 billion in 2004. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million, $57 million and $75 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and merger related integration expenses of $5 million in 2006. There 55 Table of Contents were no merger related expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.48 billion in 2006, up 4% from $1.43 billion in 2005. Included in 2006s operating expenses was the $18 million charitable contribution already discussed. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased $37 million, or less than 3% from 2005, due primarily to higher salaries costs, including merit pay increases and incentive compensation. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.44 billion in 2004. As previously noted, such expenses reflect a $25 million charitable contribution. Excluding that contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. That increase from 2004 resulted from higher costs of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and increased professional services expenses, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $873 million in 2006, up 6% from $822 million in 2005. The most significant contributor to the increase was a higher level of salaries expense in 2006, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases and higher stock based compensation costs and other incentive pay. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $807 million in 2004. Expenses related to providing employee health care and retirement benefits were the most significant contributors to the rise in salaries and benefits from 2004 to 2005. The Company recognizes expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting for all stock based compensation granted to employees after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2006, 2005 and 2004 included $51 million, $45 million and $48 million, respectively, of stock based compensation. The higher level of stock based compensation in 2006 was largely due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), effective January 1, 2006. As required, coincident with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and employees who will become retirement eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a result, stock based compensation expense during 2006 included $4 million that would otherwise have been recognized over the normal four year vesting period if not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 123R. That acceleration had no effect on the value of stock based compensation awarded to employees. The number of full time equivalent employees was 12,721 at December 31, 2006, compared with 12,780 and 12,678 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pension benefit expense is a significant cost to the Company and totaled $28 million in 2006, $38 million in 2005 and $30 million in 2004. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The expense for 2006 includes $7 million related to a new qualified defined contribution plan introduced on January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment. The Companys 2006 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long term rate of return on assets of 8.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.90%; and a discount rate of 5.50%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to 56 Table of Contents changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $.5 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans reflects the long term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $101 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $8 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $2 million in 2004. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to SFAS No. 87 or SFAS No. 106, be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the combined benefit obligations (as defined under SFAS No. 158) of the Companys defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $205 million. Of that amount, $96 million was related to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and $109 million related to non qualified pension and other postretirement plans that are generally not funded until benefits are paid. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans that was at least equal to $205 million at December 31, 2006. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2006 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of $46 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby stockholders equity) by $28 million. Because the recognition requirements of SFAS No. 158 were required to be applied at the end of the year of adoption, the Company had to first recognize the additional minimum liability amounts required under the provisions of SFAS No. 87. As a result, as of December 31, 2006 the Company decreased its previously recorded minimum pension liability by $51 million with a corresponding increase to other comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $31 million. A combination of better than expected investment returns on plan assets during 2006 and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption to 5.75% at December 31, 2006 from 5.50% at December 31, 2005 were the significant factors contributing to the increase to other comprehensive income recorded in 2006 under the provisions of SFAS No. 87. In order to recognize the funded status of the Companys other combined defined benefit postretirement plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 158, the Company then recorded an incremental minimum liability of approximately $16 million with a corresponding reduction of stockholders equity that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $10 million. As a result, including the effects of adopting SFAS No. 158, the Company decreased its minimum liability from that which was recorded at December 31, 2005 by approximately $35 million with a corresponding increase to 57 Table of Contents stockholders equity that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $21 million. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 158, a 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2006 to 5.50% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans) of $25 million. Under that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment at December 31, 2006 would have been $71 million, rather than the $46 million that was actually recorded, and the corresponding after tax effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 would have been $44 million, rather than the $28 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 6.00% would have decreased the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate liability adjustment at December 31, 2006 would have been $22 million rather than the $46 million actually recorded and the corresponding after tax effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been $14 million rather than $28 million. The Company made contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2006 totaling approximately $36 million. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a career average pay formula as opposed to the previous final average pay formula. The amendments affected benefits earned for service periods beginning after December 31, 2005. Active participants at that time had the choice of electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined contribution pension plan, the Company makes contributions to the plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual participants total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. New employees are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but do participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million as of December 31, 2005. Certain gains associated with the $98 million in pension benefit obligation reduction attributable to employees who remained in the plan are not subject to the ten percent corridor previously noted. Guidance contained in SFAS No. 87 requires that these gains be amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining expected service period for active employees. Amortization of these gains had the effect of reducing the Companys pension expense for 2006 by approximately $7 million. In addition to the changes described above, the Company also amended its retirement savings plan (RSP), effective January 1, 2006, to allow for greater amounts of employee compensation to be eligible for contribution to the RSP. The RSP is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $21 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005 and $16 million in 2004. As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined contribution pension plan, the Company hoped to limit increases in future period expenses associated with these plans. Reflecting the impact of these changes, expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $49 million in 2006, compared with $55 million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004. Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses aggregated $611 million in 2006, up 1% from $606 million in 2005. That increase reflects the $18 million charitable contribution made in 2006. Exclusive of the contribution, nonpersonnel operating expenses decreased $13 million or 2% from 2005, due largely to lower costs for professional services, furniture and equipment. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $634 million in 2004 and included a $25 million charitable contribution. Excluding the impact of that contribution, other nonpersonnel operating 58 Table of Contents expenses in 2005 decreased $3 million from 2004. As compared with 2004, a $7 million higher reversal in 2005 of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, and lower equipment, net occupancy and other operating expenses were partially offset by higher professional services costs. The higher expenses incurred for professional services in 2005 were due in part to several initiatives of the Company, including projects focused on procurement practices, consolidation of loan application systems, revenue enhancement opportunities and operational efficiencies, as well as costs related to the already discussed subordinated note exchange. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $392 million in 2006, compared with $389 million in 2005 and $344 million in 2004. The effective tax rates were 31.9%, 33.2% and 32.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decline in the Companys effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 reflects higher levels of income that were exempt from tax in certain jurisdictions and a $3 million favorable impact from settlement of refund claims originally filed by Allfirst Financial Inc. prior to its April 1, 2003 acquisition by M&T. The refunds received, consisting of income taxes and taxable interest, exceeded the amounts previously accrued for such items by $5 million (pre tax). The increase in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 was largely due to the impact of the third quarter 2004 reorganization of two of the Companys subsidiaries that altered the taxable status of such subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions thereby decreasing the Companys effective state income tax rate for 2004. As a result of the reorganizations, both income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2004 were reduced by $12 million. The effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations attributable to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any changes in income tax regulations or interpretations of such regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by tax authorities within those jurisdictions, and the impact of changes in the accounting for income taxes resulting from the required adoption on January 1, 2007 of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The projected impact of that adoption is included herein under the heading Recent Accounting Developments. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $185 million at December 31, 2006 and $230 million at December 31, 2005. Such assets included $176 million and $217 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 57% of the Companys earning assets at each of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, compared with 59% at December 31, 2004. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs 59 Table of Contents and others. At December 31, 2006, M&T Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $6.8 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $3.4 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of approximately $4.3 billion at December 31, 2006. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2006 or 2005. The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2006. The notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% for ten years and a floating rate thereafter, at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable at the Companys option after the fixed rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory approval. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes with a par value of $409 million due 2020. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at the Companys option, subject to regulatory approval. No new funding was received as a result of the exchange. A more detailed description of the 2006 and 2005 subordinated note transactions is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $565 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings were $2.3 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, those borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally mature on the next business day and totaled $5.4 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Brokered certificates of deposit have longer maturity terms. Information regarding such deposits is included under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities. The Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 13. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services. 60 Table of Contents Table 13 DEBT RATINGS Standard Moodys and Poors Fitch M&T Bank Corporation Senior debt A3 A A Subordinated debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ M&T Bank Short term deposits Prime 1 A 1 F1 Long term deposits A2 A A Senior debt A2 A A Subordinated debt A3 A BBB+ Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time to time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $6 million and $58 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.7 billion. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual obligations which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2006 are summarized in table 15. Off balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2006 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments. 61 Table of Contents Table 15 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS Less Than One One to Three Three to Five Over Five December 31, 2006 Year Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Payments due for contractual obligations Time deposits $ 9,426,681 $ 1,642,369 $ 331,423 $ 90,156 $ 11,490,629 Deposits at foreign office 5,429,668 5,429,668 Federal funds purchased and agreements to repurchase securities 2,531,684 2,531,684 Other short term borrowings 562,530 562,530 Long term borrowings 518,543 2,806,147 532,807 3,033,244 6,890,741 Operating leases 43,931 74,784 48,829 66,757 234,301 Other 18,968 19,131 11,139 34,328 83,566 Total $ 18,532,005 $ 4,542,431 $ 924,198 $ 3,224,485 $ 27,223,119 Other commitments Commitments to extend credit $ 6,820,835 $ 4,317,118 $ 4,220,081 $ 1,683,461 $ 17,041,495 Standby letters of credit 1,471,079 1,192,282 752,319 207,180 3,622,860 Commercial letters of credit 25,626 1,110 3,473 30,209 Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts 19,194 78,762 159,882 778,279 1,036,117 Commitments to sell real estate loans 1,932,306 1,932,306 Total $ 10,269,040 $ 5,589,272 $ 5,135,755 $ 2,668,920 $ 23,662,987 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and common stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, approximately $108 million at December 31, 2006 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2005. 62 Table of Contents Table 16 MATURITY AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT YIELD OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES One Year One to Five Five to Ten Over Ten December 31, 2006 or Less Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Investment securities available for sale(a) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Carrying value $ 29,524 $ 236,351 $ 206,489 $ 1,512 $ 473,876 Yield 3.17 % 3.72 % 6.11 % 4.48 % 4.73 % Obligations of states and political subdivisions Carrying value 13,131 16,855 33,669 7,116 70,771 Yield 5.70 % 6.14 % 4.77 % 7.94 % 5.59 % Mortgage backed securities(b) Government issued or guaranteed Carrying value 142,696 523,737 528,114 713,161 1,907,708 Yield 3.70 % 3.82 % 3.94 % 4.78 % 4.20 % Privately issued Carrying value 88,152 374,667 373,319 2,960,392 3,796,530 Yield 4.23 % 4.96 % 5.15 % 4.92 % 4.93 % Other debt securities Carrying value 3,991 10,154 3,504 132,258 149,907 Yield 4.92 % 4.78 % 5.27 % 7.03 % 6.78 % Equity securities Carrying value 431,056 Yield 5.48 % Total investment securities available for sale Carrying value 277,494 1,161,764 1,145,095 3,814,439 6,829,848 Yield 3.92 % 4.21 % 4.75 % 4.97 % 4.79 % Investment securities held to maturity Obligations of states and political subdivisions Carrying value 42,166 6,815 9,319 1,136 59,436 Yield 5.64 % 7.08 % 9.63 % 7.79 % 6.47 % Other debt securities Carrying value 467 4,996 5,463 Yield 8.30 % 5.59 % 5.82 % Total investment securities held to maturity Carrying value 42,166 6,815 9,786 6,132 64,899 Yield 5.64 % 7.08 % 9.57 % 6.00 % 6.42 % Other investment securities 356,851 Total investment securities Carrying value $ 319,660 $ 1,168,579 $ 1,154,881 $ 3,820,571 $ 7,251,598 Yield 4.15 % 4.23 % 4.79 % 4.97 % 4.57 % (a) Investment securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair value.

Actual maturities are expected to be significantly shorter as a result of loan repayments in the underlying mortgage pools. Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks. 63 Table of Contents Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which the Company is exposed. Interest rate risk arises from the Companys core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and non parallel shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $1.0 billion. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 MATURITY OF DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH BALANCES OF $100,000 OR MORE December 31, 2006 (In thousands) Under 3 months $ 2,478,317 3 to 6 months 1,561,755 6 to 12 months 634,145 Over 12 months 863,789 Total $ 5,538,006 The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 64 Table of Contents Table 18 displays as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. Table 18 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES Calculated Increase (Decrease) in Projected Net Interest Income December 31 Changes in Interest Rates 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) + 200 basis points $ 15,098 $ (7,178 ) + 100 basis points 13,260 (4,096 ) 100 basis points (12,759 ) (5,733 ) 200 basis points (26,546 ) (16,184 ) The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. 65 Table of Contents Table 19 CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA Three Months Four to Twelve One to After December 31, 2006 or Less Months Five Years Five Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Loans and leases, net $ 20,521,055 $ 3,684,677 $ 10,330,431 $ 8,411,134 $ 42,947,297 Investment securities 624,657 593,873 3,702,936 2,330,132 7,251,598 Other earning assets 179,135 850 179,985 Total earning assets 21,324,847 4,279,400 14,033,367 10,741,266 50,378,880 NOW accounts 940,439 940,439 Savings deposits 14,169,790 14,169,790 Time deposits 5,817,393 4,375,761 1,246,242 51,233 11,490,629 Deposits at foreign office 5,428,596 1,072 5,429,668 Total interest bearing deposits 26,356,218 4,376,833 1,246,242 51,233 32,030,526 Short term borrowings 3,094,214 3,094,214 Long term borrowings 3,215,107 198,353 837,359 2,639,922 6,890,741 Total interest bearing liabilities 32,665,539 4,575,186 2,083,601 2,691,155 42,015,481 Interest rate swaps (922,241 ) 205,000 177,241 540,000 Periodic gap $ (12,262,933 ) $ (90,786 ) $ 12,127,007 $ 8,590,111 Cumulative gap (12,262,933 ) (12,353,719 ) (226,712 ) 8,363,399 Cumulative gap as a % of total earning assets (24.3 )% (24.5 )% (0.5 )% 16.6 % The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities. The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes aggregated $7.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $613 million and $679 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities were $137 million and $65 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and $192 million and $77 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $45 million and $41 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $49 million and $48 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of 66 Table of Contents such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions associated with the Companys trading activities. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2006 totaled $6.3 billion and represented 11.01% of total assets, compared with $5.9 billion or 10.66% at December 31, 2005 and $5.7 billion or 10.82% at December 31, 2004. On a per share basis, stockholders equity was $56.94 at December 31, 2006, up 9% from $52.39 at the 2005 year end and 15% higher than $49.68 at December 31, 2004. Tangible equity per share was $28.57 at December 31, 2006, compared with $25.91 and $23.62 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented in table 2. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.82%, 10.71% and 11.07% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges; minimum pension liability adjustments; and the impact of applying SFAS No. 158. Net unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities were $25 million, or $.23 per common share, at December 31, 2006, compared with losses of $49 million, or $.43 per common share, at December 31, 2005 and $5 million, or $.04 per common share, at December 31, 2004. Such unrealized losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, included in accumulated other comprehensive income reduced stockholders equity by $28 million at December 31, 2006, or $.26 per share. Similar adjustments to recognize minimum pension liabilities as then required by SFAS No. 87, net of applicable tax effect, reduced stockholders equity by $49 million or $.44 per share at December 31, 2005 and $12 million or $.11 per share at December 31, 2004. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Cash dividends paid in 2006 on M&Ts common stock totaled $250 million, compared with $199 million and $188 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the second quarter of 2005 from $.40 to $.45 per share, and again in the second quarter of 2006 to $.60 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $2.25 in 2006, up 29% from $1.75 in 2005 and 41% above $1.60 in 2004. M&T repurchased 3,259,000 shares of its common stock in 2006, 4,891,800 shares in 2005 and 6,520,800 shares in 2004, at a cost of $374 million, $510 million and $610 million, respectively. In December 2004, M&T had announced a plan to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. That repurchase plan was completed in December 2005. In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2006, M&T had repurchased a total of 3,303,700 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $114.66 per share. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 67 Table of Contents 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2006, core capital included $689 million of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $1.4 billion of subordinated capital notes. As previously noted, in December 2006, M&T Bank issued $500 million of fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes due 2021. The new notes bear interest at a fixed coupon rate of 5.629% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at M&Ts option, subject to regulatory approval. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after tax effect of merger related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 17.52% in 2006, 18.50% in 2005 and 18.12% in 2004. Fourth Quarter Results Net income increased 4% to $213 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 from $205 million in the year earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.88 and $1.93, respectively, in the final quarter of 2006, compared with $1.78 and $1.82, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2006 were 1.50% and 13.55%, respectively, compared with 1.48% and 13.85%, respectively, in the year earlier period. Net operating income rose 6% to $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $213 million in 2005s final quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share increased 7% to $1.98 in the recently completed quarter from $1.85 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.67% and 28.71%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with 1.63% and 29.12%, respectively, in the corresponding 2005 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $11 million ($.10 per diluted share) and $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2006 and 2005 are provided in table 21. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 4% to $472 million in the final quarter of 2006 from $454 million in the year earlier quarter. That growth was the result of a 3% increase in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $50.2 billion in the last quarter of 2006, compared with $48.8 billion in the year earlier period. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $42.5 billion, up 5% from $40.4 billion during the final quarter of 2005. A $1.1 billion increase in commercial real estate loans, an $863 million rise in residential real estate loans, and a $786 million increase in commercial loans were the leading contributors to the growth in average loans outstanding. The yield on earning assets was 6.92% in the fourth quarter of 2006, up 76 basis points from 6.16% in the fourth quarter of 2005. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 3.83% in the last quarter of 2006, 85 basis points higher than 2.98% in the corresponding period in 2005. The resulting net interest spread was 3.09% in the recent quarter, down 9 basis points from 3.18% in the fourth quarter of 2005. That decline reflects the impact of higher interest rates in 2006 that resulted in short term interest rates associated with borrowings and many deposits rising more than longer term interest rates associated with many loan products. However, the contribution of net interest free funds to the Companys net interest margin rose to .64% in the final 2006 quarter from .51% in the year earlier quarter. That rise reflects the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. As a result, the Companys net interest margin improved to 3.73% in the recent quarter from 3.69% in the final quarter of 2005. The provision for credit losses was $28 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2006, compared with $23 million in the year earlier period. Net charge offs of loans were $24 million in 2006s fourth quarter, representing an annualized .23% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $23 million or .22% during the final three months of 2005. 68 Table of Contents Other income totaled $256 million in the final quarter of 2006, up 3% from $249 million in the year earlier quarter, due in part to higher revenues from trust and brokerage services activities, service charges on deposit accounts and income from bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues. Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 4% to $384 million from $369 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $19 million and $13 million in the final quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $365 million in the recently completed quarter, up 2% from $356 million in the last three months of 2005. Higher costs for salaries and a $1 million increase to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with a reversal of a portion of such valuation allowance of $6 million in the year earlier quarter, were the leading contributors to that rise in operating expense. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005 was 50.2% and 50.7%, respectively. Table 21 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2006 and 2005. Segment Information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. Net income earned by the Commercial Banking segment rose 3% to $226 million in 2006 from $219 million in 2005. That improvement was primarily the result of a $25 million rise in net interest income, partially offset by increased noninterest expenses, most significantly higher personnel costs of $7 million. The higher net interest income was predominantly due to a widening of the net interest margin and an 8% increase in average loan balances outstanding, offset, in part, by a 17% decrease in average demand deposit balances. In 2004, this segments net income aggregated $213 million. The favorable performance in 2005 as compared to 2004 was due largely to an increase in net interest income of $21 million, mainly the result of a 7% increase in loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a $9 million increase in noninterest expenses, due predominantly to higher personnel costs. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. This segment contributed net income of $135 million in 2006, down 6% from the $143 million earned in 2005. The decline was the result of an $8 million 69 Table of Contents decrease in net interest income, predominantly due to a narrowing of net interest margin on loans outstanding, higher noninterest expenses of $6 million and lower commercial mortgage credit related fees and other revenues of $4 million. Net income in 2005 for the Commercial Real Estate segment was 13% above the $126 million earned in 2004. That improvement was due to an increase in net interest income of $19 million that resulted from higher average loan balances and a wider margin associated with deposits, a $4 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues and a lower provision for credit losses of $5 million. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC owned by the Company. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $96 million in 2006, 3% higher than $93 million in 2005. Contributing to that increase were the $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC reflected in 2005s results and the $13 million gain in 2006 resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. Partially offsetting these favorable factors was a $39 million decrease in net interest income resulting from a 58 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on investment securities and a $470 million decline in the average balance of the segments portfolio of investment securities. Net income contributed by the Discretionary Portfolio segment was $112 million in 2004. The 17% decline in 2005 as compared with 2004 was predominantly the result of the previously mentioned other than temporary impairment charge reflected in 2005s results. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the southern and western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segments net income rose 21% to $52 million in 2006 from $43 million in 2005. The improved performance was predominantly due to an 11% increase in noninterest revenues resulting from higher income from servicing mortgage loans of $10 million and increased gains from the sales of loans to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of $9 million. Also contributing to the improvement was an $8 million increase in net interest income, mainly due to a 30% increase in balances of loans held for sale, net of a 52 basis point decline in net interest margin associated with such loan balances. Partially offsetting these favorable factors were higher salaries and benefits expenses of $8 million and other noninterest expenses of $4 million. Included in noninterest expenses were partial reversals of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $10 million and $8 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income for the Residential Mortgage Banking segment totaled $29 million in 2004. The 50% increase in net income from 2004 to 2005 was due predominantly to higher noninterest revenues of $20 million, resulting from loan origination, sales and servicing activities, and higher net interest income of $10 million, attributable primarily to an increase in average loan balances outstanding. Also contributing to the segments improved performance from 2004 to 2005 was the effect of an $8 million partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance recognized during 2005, compared with a $2 million partial reversal of such allowance recognized during 2004. Partially offsetting revenue growth was a $14 million increase in salaries and benefits expenses. Gains from the sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $19 million, $10 million and $9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels which include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. Effective January 2, 2007, M&T Bank 70 Table of Contents opened its first banking office in New Jersey. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. Net income for the Retail Banking segment aggregated $410 million in 2006, up 26% from $325 million in 2005. The favorable performance was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $119 million, largely resulting from a widening net interest margin on deposit products. Also contributing to the improvement were higher service charges on deposit accounts of $16 million. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $251 million in 2004. The 30% increase from 2004 to 2005 was due predominantly to increases in net interest income of $81 million, largely attributable to an increase in net interest margin on deposit products. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $21 million, lower noninterest expenses of $13 million, and a $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses also contributed to the rise in net income from 2004 to 2005. The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of financial institutions, the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses, and, in 2006, acquisition and integration related expenses resulting from the branch acquisition completed by M&T Bank on June 30, 2006. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $80 million, $41 million and $9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments was the main factor for the increased net loss in 2006. Also contributing to the net loss were the previously mentioned $18 million charitable contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation and higher charges for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger related expenses incurred as a result of the branch acquisition of $17 million and $5 million, respectively. The higher net loss incurred during 2005 as compared with 2004 resulted largely from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. Noninterest expenses in 2004 were $44 million higher than in 2005, reflecting 2004s $25 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation and a $19 million higher charge for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The 2004 net loss also reflected the $12 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the reorganization of certain of M&Ts subsidiaries. Recent Accounting Developments In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment to FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. As a result, such instruments would be accounted for in one of two ways. Under the first allowable method, an entity would bifurcate the embedded derivative feature and record the bifurcated derivative at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value of the bifurcated derivative would be reported in earnings. As an alternative, an entity could elect not to bifurcate the embedded derivative but instead record the entire financial instrument at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value of the security being reported in earnings. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133 and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year, provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for any interim period for that fiscal year. The Company 71 Table of Contents adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 155 as of January 1, 2007 and does not anticipate that the impact of such adoption will be material to its financial position or results of operations. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS No. 156 defines the situations in which an entity should recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability when it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract. SFAS No. 156 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value and permits an entity to choose its subsequent measurement method for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities as either the amortization method or fair value measurement method. The amortization method requires that servicing assets and servicing liabilities be amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date. The fair value measurement method requires servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be measured at fair value at each reporting date and requires entities to report changes in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 156 requires prospective adoption as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year, provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements, including interim financial statements, for any period of that fiscal year. An entity may elect to subsequently measure a class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value as of the beginning of any fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year in which the entity adopts this statement. Upon such election, which is irrevocable, the effect of remeasuring an existing class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value should be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Currently, the Company initially measures servicing assets retained in sales and securitization transactions for which it is the transferor under the relative fair value method prescribed in SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, and subsequently measures its servicing assets under the amortization method. The Company has not early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 156 and currently does not intend to adopt the fair value measurement method for any classes of separately recognized servicing assets in 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 156 on January 1, 2007, therefore, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The definition of fair value is clarified by SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. The disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of the measurements on earnings for the period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The provisions generally should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which SFAS No. 157 is applied, with certain provisions required to be applied retrospectively. Many of the Companys assets, liabilities and off balance sheet positions are required to either be accounted for or disclosed using fair value as their relevant measurement attribute. Given the pervasiveness of fair value measurements throughout the Companys financial statements, the Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes the accounting method to be applied to measure uncertainty in income taxes recognized under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position in accordance with FIN No. 48 is a two step process. The first step is recognition, which requires 72 Table of Contents a determination whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is measurement. Under the measurement step, a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets) for that fiscal year. The adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, but will likely increase the Companys effective income tax rate by approximately .75% to 1.0% from what it otherwise would have been. In July 2006, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position No. 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13 2). FSP 13 2 requires that a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease shall be accounted for in accordance with the guidance in paragraph 46 of SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. That is, the projected timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease transaction shall be reviewed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in timing has occurred or is projected to occur. If, during the lease term, the projected timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease is revised, the rate of return and the allocation of income to positive investment years shall be recalculated from inception of the lease following the method described in paragraph 44 of SFAS No. 13. The guidance in FSP 13 2 shall be applied to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FSP 13 2 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FSP 13 2 on January 1, 2007 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. At its September 2006 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a final consensus on Issue 06 04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. The consensus stipulates that an agreement by an employer to share a portion of the proceeds of a life insurance policy with an employee during the postretirement period is a postretirement benefit arrangement required to be accounted for under SFAS No. 106 or Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 12, Omnibus Opinion 1967. The consensus concludes that the purchase of a split dollar life insurance policy does not constitute a settlement under SFAS No. 106 and, therefore, a liability for the postretirement obligation must be recognized under SFAS No. 106 if the benefit is offered under an arrangement that constitutes a plan or under APB No. 12 if it is not part of a plan. Issue 06 04 is effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2007. The provisions of Issue 06 04 should be applied through either a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or retrospective application. The Company has endorsement split dollar life insurance policies that it inherited through certain acquisitions that are associated with employees who are no longer active. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the provisions of Issue 06 04 will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Also at its September 2006 meeting, the EITF reached a final consensus on Issue 06 05, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4. The consensus concludes that in determining the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract accounted for under FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance, the policyholder should (1) consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy; (2) assume the surrender value on a individual life by individual life policy basis; and (3) not discount the cash surrender value component 73 Table of Contents of the amount that could be realized when contractual restrictions on the ability to surrender a policy exist. Issue 06 05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The consensus in Issue 06 05 should be adopted through either (1) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earning as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (2) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods. At December 31, 2006, the Company had bank owned life insurance policies with a carrying value of $1.1 billion. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the provisions of Issue 06 05 on January 1, 2007 will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of the Companys Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Corporate Profile and Significant Developments M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $57.1 billion at December 31, 2006. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.). M&T Bank, with total assets of $56.4 billion at December 31, 2006, is a New York chartered commercial bank with 671 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. On January 2, 2007, M&T Bank opened its first banking office in New Jersey. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in its markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although residential real estate loans are originated through lending offices in 22 states. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Credit Services, LLC, a consumer lending and commercial leasing and lending company; M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multi family commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency. Effective January 1, 2007, M&T Mortgage Corporation, a residential mortgage banking company wholly owned by M&T Bank, was merged into M&T Bank. M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $511 million at December 31, 2006, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone and direct mail marketing techniques. 29 Table of Contents On June 30, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of 21 branch offices in Buffalo and Rochester, New York from Citibank, N.A., including approximately $269 million in loans, mostly to consumers, small businesses and middle market customers, and approximately $1.0 billion of deposits. M&Ts financial results for 2006 reflect the impact of that transaction from the acquisition date through December 31, 2006. Expenses associated with integrating the acquired branches into M&T Bank and introducing the customers associated with those branches to M&T Banks products and services aggregated $3 million, after applicable tax effect, or $.03 of diluted earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company does not expect that any significant additional acquisition and integration related expenses will be incurred. Including the impact of acquisition related expenses and the amortization of core deposit intangible resulting from the transaction, net income and diluted earnings per share of the Company in 2006 were reduced by approximately $10 million and $.09, respectively, as a result of the transaction. As of December 31, 2006, there were no significant amounts of unpaid acquisition related expenses. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following: Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Valuation methodologies Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, value ascribed to stock based compensation, estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Commitments, contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Overview Net income for the Company in 2006 was $839 million or $7.37 of diluted earnings per common share, up 7% and 10%, respectively, from $782 million or $6.73 of diluted earnings per share in 2005. Basic earnings per common share rose 10% to $7.55 in 2006 from $6.88 in 2005. Net income in 2004 totaled $723 million, while diluted and basic earnings per share were $6.00 and $6.14, respectively. The after tax impact of acquisition and integration related expenses (included herein as merger related expenses) associated with the June 30 branch acquisition already discussed was $3 million ($5 million pre tax) or $.03 of basic and diluted earnings per share in 2006. There were no similar expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2006 was 1.50%, compared with 1.44% in 2005 and 1.40% in 2004. The return on average common stockholders equity was 13.89% in 2006, 13.49% in 2005 and 12.67% in 2004. Net interest income recorded on a taxable equivalent basis increased 1% to $1.84 billion in 2006 from $1.81 billion in 2005. The impact of a higher level of average earning assets was largely offset by a decline in the Companys net interest margin, or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Average earning assets rose 3% to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005, the result of increased balances of loans and leases, offset, in part, by a decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities. Average loans and leases of $41.4 billion in 2006 were $1.9 billion or 5% higher than $39.5 billion in 2005, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $863 million, or 8%, commercial real estate loans of $755 million, or 5%, and consumer real estate loans of $1.1 billion, or 28%, partially offset by an $804 million, or 7% decline in consumer loans and leases. Average balances of investment securities decreased 5% to $8.0 billion in 2006 from $8.5 billion in 2005. The net interest margin declined 7 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005, largely due to higher short term interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate 100 basis points during the first six months of 2006, continuing a trend of rate increases that began in June 2004. Such interest rate increases had the effect of increasing rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more rapidly than yields on earning assets during 2005 and the first half of 2006. During the last six months of 2006, the Companys net interest margin stabilized as compared to the first half of the year. As a result of higher average earning assets, taxable equivalent net interest income in 2005 was 3% higher than $1.75 billion in 2004. Average earning assets in 2005 rose 6% from $45.2 billion in 2004. Average loans and leases outstanding in 2005 were up $2.4 billion, or 6%, from $37.1 billion in 2004, largely due to growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and consumer real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer loans and leases. Net interest margin in 2005 declined 11 basis points from 3.88% in 2004, largely due to the rising interest rate environment which resulted in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than yields on earning assets. 31 Table of Contents The provision for credit losses declined to $80 million in 2006 from $88 million in 2005 and $95 million in 2004. The reduced levels of the provision during the past two years as compared with 2004 were reflective of generally favorable credit quality. Net charge offs were $68 million in 2006, down from $77 million in 2005 and $82 million in 2004. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding decreased to .16% in 2006 from .19% in 2005 and .22% in 2004. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans. While most credit quality measures improved from 2004 to 2005, the Company did experience an increase in nonperforming loans during the second half of 2006, due largely to the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers. Noninterest income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006 from $950 million in 2005. Higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. Included in noninterest income in 2006 was a $13 million gain resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. Losses from bank investment securities in 2005 included a $29 million non cash, other than temporary impairment charge in the third quarter related to preferred stock issuances of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses in both years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006, noninterest income rose 5% from 2005 to 2006. Noninterest income totaled $943 million in 2004. Comparing 2005 with 2004, higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues were largely offset by the $29 million impairment charge in 2005. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, noninterest income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Noninterest expense in 2006 aggregated $1.55 billion, up 4% from $1.49 billion in 2005. Noninterest expense in 2004 was $1.52 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million, $57 million and $75 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and merger related expenses of $5 million in 2006. As already noted, there were no merger related expenses in 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.48 billion in 2006, $1.43 billion in 2005 and $1.44 billion in 2004. Included in operating expenses in 2006 and 2004 were tax deductible contributions made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax exempt private charitable foundation, of $18 million and $25 million, respectively. There was no similar contribution made in 2005. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased $37 million, or 3%, from 2005. The most significant contributor to that increase was a higher level of salaries expense, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases and higher stock based compensation costs and other incentive pay. Excluding the impact of the $25 million charitable contribution in 2004, noninterest operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. That slight increase reflects higher costs of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and higher professional services expenses offset, in part, by a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates. The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities), was 51.5% in 2006, compared with 51.2% in 2005 and 53.5% in 2004. 32 Table of Contents Table 1 EARNINGS SUMMARY Dollars in millions Compound Increase (Decrease)(a) Growth Rate 2005 to 2006 2004 to 2005 5 Years Amount % Amount % 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 to 2006 $ 527.8 19 $ 489.9 21 Interest income(b) $ 3,333.8 2,806.0 2,316.1 2,142.9 1,856.1 9 % 502.2 51 430.2 76 Interest expense 1,496.6 994.4 564.2 527.8 594.5 10 25.6 1 59.7 3 Net interest income(b) 1,837.2 1,811.6 1,751.9 1,615.1 1,261.6 9 (8.0 ) (9 ) (7.0 ) (7 ) Less: provision for credit losses 80.0 88.0 95.0 131.0 122.0 (5 ) 30.7 (31.0 ) Gain (loss) on bank investment securities 2.6 (28.1 ) 2.9 2.5 (.6 ) 65.4 7 37.7 4 Other income 1,043.2 977.8 940.1 828.6 512.5 17 Less: 51.1 6 15.6 2 Salaries and employee benefits 873.3 822.2 806.6 740.3 497.0 13 15.5 2 (46.6 ) (7 ) Other expense 678.4 662.9 709.5 708.0 464.6 6 63.1 5 104.4 10 Income before income taxes 1,251.3 1,188.2 1,083.8 866.9 689.9 17 Less: 2.4 14 Taxable equivalent adjustment(b) 19.7 17.3 17.3 16.3 14.0 2 3.7 1 44.7 13 Income taxes 392.4 388.7 344.0 276.7 219.1 15 $ 57.0 7 $ 59.7 8 Net income $ 839.2 782.2 722.5 573.9 456.8 19 % (a) Changes were calculated from unrounded amounts. (b) Interest income data are on a taxable equivalent basis. The taxable equivalent adjustment represents additional income taxes that would be due if all interest income were subject to income taxes. This adjustment, which is related to interest received on qualified municipal securities, industrial revenue financings and preferred equity securities, is based on a composite income tax rate of approximately 39% for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2002, and 36% for 2003. Supplemental Reporting of Non GAAP Results of Operations As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006, $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2004. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $38 million, $35 million and $46 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, in which M&T excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts, when calculating certain performance ratios) and expenses associated with integrating acquired operations into the Company, since such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. Net operating income increased 8% to $881 million in 2006 from $817 million in 2005. Diluted net operating earnings per share in 2006 rose 10% to $7.73 from $7.03 in 2005. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share were $769 million and $6.38, respectively, during 2004. Reconciliations of net income and diluted earnings per share with net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per share are presented in table 2. Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was 1.67% in 2006, compared with 1.60% in 2005 and 1.59% in 2004. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 29.55% in 2006, improved from 29.06% and 28.76% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Reconciliations of average assets and equity with average tangible assets and average tangible equity are also presented in table 2.

Average earning assets increased 3% to $49.7 billion in 2006 from $48.1 billion in 2005. That growth resulted from a 5% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases of $1.9 billion, offset in part by a 5% decline in average outstanding balances of investment securities of $441 million. The positive impact of higher average earning assets on taxable equivalent net interest income was largely offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.70% in 2006 from 3.77% in 2005. Average loans and leases outstanding aggregated $41.4 billion in 2006, up 5% from $39.5 billion in 2005. The higher average outstanding loan balances were the result of growth in commercial loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans. Average commercial loans and leases rose 8% to $11.3 billion in 2006 from $10.5 billion in 2005. Commercial real estate loans averaged $15.1 billion during 2006, 5% higher than $14.3 billion in 2005, reflecting a $336 million rise in construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The Companys residential real estate loan portfolio averaged $5.0 billion in 2006, up 28% from $3.9 billion in 2005. Included in that portfolio were loans held for sale, which averaged $1.5 billion in 2006, 19% above the $1.2 billion averaged in 2005. Excluding such loans, average residential real estate loans increased $861 million from 2005 to 2006. That increase was largely the result of the Companys decision to retain higher levels of residential real estate loans having certain characteristics, due to narrowing margins available in the marketplace when selling such loans and the lack of availability of investment securities to acquire that met the Companys desired characteristics and provided suitable returns. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.0 billion in 2006, down 7% from $10.8 billion in 2005. That decline was the result of lower average balances of automobile loans and leases, which decreased 22% to $2.9 billion in 2006 from $3.7 billion in 2005, reflecting the Companys decision to allow such balances to decline rather than matching interest rates offered by competitors. During late 2006, the interest rate environment relating to the Companys automobile lending business improved and from September 30 to December 31, outstanding balances of such loans increased slightly. 35 Table of Contents Table 3 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT RATES 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate (Average balance in millions; interest in thousands) Assets Earning assets Loans and leases, net of unearned discount(a) Commercial, financial, etc. $ 11,319 $ 802,451 7.09 % 10,455 589,644 5.64 % 9,534 410,258 4.30 % 8,523 358,629 4.21 % 5,146 261,867 5.09 % Real estate commercial 15,096 1,104,518 7.32 14,341 941,017 6.56 13,264 763,134 5.75 11,573 706,022 6.10 9,498 661,382 6.96 Real estate consumer 5,015 319,858 6.38 3,925 235,364 6.00 3,111 184,125 5.92 3,777 232,454 6.15 4,087 285,055 6.98 Consumer 10,003 712,484 7.12 10,808 664,509 6.15 11,220 626,255 5.58 10,098 607,909 6.02 6,776 467,167 6.89 Total loans and leases, net 41,433 2,939,311 7.09 39,529 2,430,534 6.15 37,129 1,983,772 5.34 33,971 1,905,014 5.61 25,507 1,675,471 6.57 Interest bearing deposits at banks 12 372 3.01 10 169 1.64 13 65 .51 14 147 1.03 6 76 1.32 Federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities 81 5,597 6.91 23 808 3.55 8 134 1.60 147 1,875 1.28 272 4,455 1.63 Trading account 90 2,446 2.71 80 1,544 1.92 53 418 .79 55 647 1.18 13 247 1.86 Investment securities(b) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 2,884 121,669 4.22 3,479 134,528 3.87 4,169 158,953 3.81 2,599 106,209 4.09 1,292 81,412 6.30 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 157 10,223 6.53 180 10,860 6.04 218 15,017 6.90 251 15,827 6.30 279 17,828 6.40 Other 4,995 254,142 5.09 4,817 227,562 4.72 3,610 157,703 4.37 2,494 113,159 4.54 1,552 76,659 4.94 Total investment securities 8,036 386,034 4.80 8,476 372,950 4.40 7,997 331,673 4.15 5,344 235,195 4.40 3,123 175,899 5.63 Total earning assets 49,652 3,333,760 6.71 48,118 2,806,005 5.83 45,200 2,316,062 5.13 39,531 2,142,878 5.42 28,921 1,856,148 6.42 Allowance for credit losses (646 ) (638 ) (626 ) (574 ) (438 ) Cash and due from banks 1,346 1,400 1,599 1,542 732 Other assets 5,487 5,255 5,344 4,850 2,720 Total assets $ 55,839 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities Interest bearing deposits NOW accounts $ 435 3,461 .79 400 2,182 .55 550 1,802 .33 1,021 3,613 .35 761 3,900 .51 Savings deposits 14,401 201,543 1.40 14,889 139,445 .94 15,305 92,064 .60 13,278 102,190 .77 8,899 107,281 1.21 Time deposits 12,420 551,514 4.44 9,158 294,782 3.22 6,948 154,722 2.23 6,638 159,700 2.41 7,398 237,001 3.20 Deposits at foreign office 3,610 178,348 4.94 3,819 120,122 3.15 3,136 43,034 1.37 1,445 14,991 1.04 569 8,460 1.49 Total interest bearing deposits 30,866 934,866 3.03 28,266 556,531 1.97 25,939 291,622 1.12 22,382 280,494 1.25 17,627 356,642 2.02 Short term borrowings 4,530 227,850 5.03 4,890 157,853 3.23 5,142 71,172 1.38 4,331 49,064 1.13 3,125 52,723 1.69 Long term borrowings 6,013 333,836 5.55 6,411 279,967 4.37 5,832 201,366 3.45 6,018 198,252 3.29 4,162 185,149 4.45 Total interest bearing liabilities 41,409 1,496,552 3.61 39,567 994,351 2.51 36,913 564,160 1.53 32,731 527,810 1.61 24,914 594,514 2.39 Noninterest bearing deposits 7,555 8,050 8,039 6,801 3,618 Other liabilities 834 720 864 876 377 Total liabilities 49,798 48,337 45,816 40,408 28,909 Stockholders equity 6,041 5,798 5,701 4,941 3,026 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 55,839 54,135 51,517 45,349 31,935 Net interest spread 3.10 3.32 3.60 3.81 4.03 Contribution of interest free funds .60 .45 .28 .28 .33 Net interest income/margin on earning assets $ 1,837,208 3.70 % 1,811,654 3.77 % 1,751,902 3.88 % 1,615,068 4.09 % 1,261,634 4.36 % (a) Includes nonaccrual loans.

That improvement reflected a 6% increase in average earning assets to $48.1 billion in 2005 from $45.2 billion in 2004, partially offset by a narrowing of the Companys net interest margin, which declined to 3.77% in 2005 from 3.88% in 2004. The growth in average earning assets reflects higher average loans and leases outstanding, which rose 6% to $39.5 billion in 2005 from 2004s average of $37.1 billion, and higher average investment securities balances, which also increased 6% to $8.5 billion in 2005 from $8.0 billion in 2004. The Company experienced growth in most major loan categories during 2005 as compared with 2004. Average commercial loans and leases rose 10% to $10.5 billion in 2005 from $9.5 billion in 2004, reflecting, in part, a $212 million rise in average automobile floor plan loans outstanding. Commercial real estate loans averaged $14.3 billion during 2005, 8% higher than $13.3 billion in 2004. Contributing to that increase were $467 million of higher average balances of construction loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Average residential real estate loan balances rose 26% to $3.9 billion in 2005 from $3.1 billion in 2004. A higher level of loans held for sale was the most significant contributor to that increase. Consumer loans and leases averaged $10.8 billion during 2005, down 4% from $11.2 billion in 2004. Average balances of automobile loans and leases decreased 16% to $3.7 billion in 2005 from $4.4 billion in 2004, largely due to unfavorable rates being offered by competitors. Partially offsetting the drop in automobile loan and lease balances was a 13% rise in average outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit to $4.0 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004. Table 4 summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in 2006 and percentage changes in the major components of the portfolio over the past two years.

Table 5 presents information on such commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2006 relating to geographic area, size, and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $11.7 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2006, approximately $9.7 billion, or 83%, were secured, while 49%, 26% and 13% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2006 aggregated $1.2 billion, of which 41% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 13% were secured by collateral in Maryland and another 13% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania. 37 Table of Contents International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $176 million and $217 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services. The loans generally range from $500 thousand to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these programs at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $143 million and $200 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, the Company held approximately $15.4 billion of commercial real estate loans, $6.0 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties (including $1.9 billion of loans held for sale) and $5.4 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $14.5 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005. A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally 38 Table of Contents considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon and West Virginia. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately ten years, and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction loans, adjustable rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 41% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2006. Of the $5.1 billion of commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area, approximately 31% were secured by multifamily residential properties, 40% by retail space and 8% by office space. The Companys experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 45% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less, while loans of more than $15 million made up approximately 24% of the total. 39 Table of Contents Table 6 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS (Net of unearned discount) December 31, 2006 Percent of Dollars Outstanding by Loan Size Outstandings $0 1 $1 5 $5 10 $10 15 $15+ (Dollars in millions) Metropolitan New York City Apartments/Multifamily $ 1,602 3 % 14 % 6 % 3 % 5 % Office 402 1 2 2 1 2 Retail/Services 2,020 3 14 8 4 11 Construction 315 2 1 1 2 Industrial 213 1 1 1 1 Other 561 1 3 3 1 3 Total Metropolitan New York City 5,113 9 % 36 % 21 % 10 % 24 % Other New York State Apartments/Multifamily 281 2 % 3 % 1 % 1 % % Office 893 7 9 4 1 3 Retail/Services 935 9 10 4 1 1 Construction 614 2 5 3 1 5 Industrial 408 5 5 1 Other 651 6 6 2 2 1 Total other New York State 3,782 31 % 38 % 15 % 6 % 10 % Pennsylvania Apartments/Multifamily 265 3 % 3 % 1 % 2 % 1 % Office 397 6 5 2 2 Retail/Services 547 7 9 2 2 1 Construction 286 1 5 3 1 1 Industrial 366 4 6 2 2 Other 746 16 11 2 Total Pennsylvania 2,607 37 % 39 % 12 % 7 % 5 % Maryland Apartments/Multifamily 31 1 % 1 % % % % Office 390 8 7 4 3 Retail/Services 219 4 3 3 1 1 Construction 585 1 8 10 3 10 Industrial 190 3 5 1 1 Other 401 9 7 2 1 3 Total Maryland 1,816 26 % 31 % 20 % 6 % 17 % Other Apartments/Multifamily 141 1 % 3 % 2 % 1 % % Office 122 1 1 2 1 1 Retail/Services 503 2 6 7 4 5 Construction 956 10 11 8 4 12 Industrial 149 1 3 1 2 Other 228 2 4 4 1 Total other 2,099 17 % 28 % 24 % 13 % 18 % Total commercial real estate loans $ 15,417 22 % 35 % 18 % 9 % 16 % 40 Table of Contents Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other areas tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business. Approximately 69% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real estate loans in Pennsylvania and Maryland, approximately 76% and 57%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $5 million or less. Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 14% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2006. Commercial real estate construction loans presented in table 6 totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006, or 6% of total loans and leases. Approximately 97% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2006 were $1.1 billion of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multi family residential housing, retail space and other commercial development. M&T Realty Capital Corporation, one of the Companys commercial real estate lending subsidiaries, participates in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by FNMA and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one third of the outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $939 million and $941 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2006 and 2005 aggregated $49 million and $199 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties were $6.0 billion at December 31, 2006, including approximately 31% secured by properties located in New York State, 13% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 9% secured by properties located in Maryland. At December 31, 2006, $1.9 billion of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. Loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential properties totaled $693 million at December 31, 2006, or approximately 2% of total loans and leases, compared with $583 million or 1% at December 31, 2005. Consumer loans and leases comprised approximately 24% of the average loan portfolio during 2006, down from 27% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans and leases. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 10% of average loans outstanding in 2006 and 2005. Automobile loans and leases represented approximately 7% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2006, down from 9% in 2005. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2006. Approximately 54% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006 were secured by properties in New York State, and 18% and 22% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were $4.2 billion in 2006, up 5% from $4.0 billion in 2005. The Company continues to pursue growing the home equity portfolio, which has historically experienced a lower level of credit losses than other types of consumer loans. However, the rate of growth from 2005 to 2006 slowed, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on this portfolio of predominantly variable interest rate loans. At December 31, 2006, 30% and 32% of the automobile loan and lease portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans and leases have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are 41 Table of Contents subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Since mid 2004, the Company has experienced a general slowdown in its automobile loan origination business, resulting from increased competition from other lenders, including financing incentives offered by automobile manufacturers. Throughout that period, the Company chose not to match the pricing being offered by many competitors. During late 2006 the interest rate environment as it relates to these loans improved such that the outstanding balances in this portfolio increased by $42 million to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006 from September 30, 2006. Automobile leases outstanding averaged approximately $53 million in 2006, compared with $137 million in 2005 and $308 million in 2004. The Company ceased origination of automobile leases during 2003. That decision did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, outstanding automobile leases totaled $29 million and $85 million, respectively. Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2006, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states. Approximately 48% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2006 were to New York State customers, while 21% and 12% were to Pennsylvania and Maryland customers, respectively.

Balances of investment securities averaged $8.0 billion in 2006 and 2004, compared with $8.5 billion in 2005. The decline in such securities from 2005 to 2006 reflects net paydowns of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The Company has allowed the investment securities portfolio to decline as the opportunity to purchase securities at favorable spreads, that is, the difference 42 Table of Contents between the yield earned on a security and the rate paid on funds used to purchase it, has been limited. The increase in average balances of investment securities from 2004 to 2005 was the result of net purchases in late 2004 and in 2005 consisting largely of collateralized residential mortgage obligations. The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter term U.S. Treasury notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing its investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, or credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination. The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company concluded that such declines were temporary in nature. Events occurring during 2005s third quarter resulted in the Company recognizing an other than temporary impairment charge of $29 million related to preferred securities of FNMA and FHLMC. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $183 million in 2006, $113 million in 2005 and $74 million in 2004. The amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the level of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios. The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Also included in core deposits are certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T Bank, N.A. Core deposits averaged $28.3 billion in 2006, $27.9 billion in 2005 and $28.1 billion in 2004. The previously discussed June 30, 2006 branch acquisition added approximately $880 million to average core deposits during the second half of 2006, or approximately $443 million for the full year. The rise in average balances of time deposits less than $100,000 in 2006 compared with 2005 and in 2005 as compared with 2004 was partially due to customer response to higher interest rates offered on those products, resulting in a shift of funds from savings and non interest bearing deposit accounts to time deposits. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $387 million in 2006, $216 million in 2005 and $223 million in 2004. Funding provided by core deposits represented 57% of average earning assets in 2006, compared with 58% in 2005 and 62% in 2004. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2006 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years. Table 8 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2006 2005 to 2006 2004 to 2005 (Dollars in millions) NOW accounts $ 435 9 % (27 )% Savings deposits 14,332 (3 ) (3 ) Time deposits under $100,000 5,983 29 8 Noninterest bearing deposits 7,555 (6 ) Total $ 28,305 1 % (1 )% 43 Table of Contents Additional sources of funding for the Company include domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.9 billion in 2006, $1.8 billion in 2005 and $1.2 billion in 2004. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $3.6 billion in 2006, $3.8 billion in 2005 and $3.1 billion in 2004. Average brokered time deposits totaled $3.5 billion in 2006, compared with $2.7 billion in 2005 and $1.4 billion in 2004, and at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $2.7 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was 11 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $390 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered money market deposit accounts, which averaged $69 million, $62 million and $57 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for such deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time. The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), and others as sources of funding. Short term borrowings averaged $4.5 billion in 2006, $4.9 billion in 2005 and $5.1 billion in 2004. Included in short term borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature daily, and averaged $3.7 billion, $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represent the largest component of short term borrowings and are obtained daily from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Also included in short term borrowings is a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that were transferred to M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of M&T Bank. The subsidiary, the loans and the borrowings are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Additional information about M&T Auto Receivables I, LLC and the revolving borrowing agreement is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average balance of long term borrowings was $6.0 billion in 2006, $6.4 billion in 2005 and $5.8 billion in 2004. Included in average long term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLBs of $3.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and $3.3 billion in 2004, and subordinated capital notes of $1.2 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005 and 2004. M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2006, in part to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios. The notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% until December 2016 and a floating rate thereafter until maturity in December 2021, at a rate equal to the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .64%. Beginning December 2016, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the notes on any interest payment date. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for $409 million of subordinated notes bearing a fixed coupon rate of interest of 5.585% through December 2015 and a variable rate of interest equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215% from December 2015 to the maturity date in December 2020. Beginning December 2015, M&T Bank may, at its option and subject to prior regulatory approval, redeem some or all of the new notes on any interest payment date. In accordance with GAAP, the Company accounted for the exchange as a modification of debt terms and not as an extinguishment of debt because, among other factors, the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new subordinated notes was not at least ten percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original terms of the exchanged subordinated notes. Coincident with the exchange, M&T Bank terminated $363 million out of a total notional amount of $500 million of interest rate swap agreements that were used to hedge the 8.0% subordinated notes. Under the terms of the swap agreements, the Company pays a variable rate of interest and receives a fixed rate. The Company paid $15 million to terminate the $363 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements. A hedge valuation adjustment of $15 million related to the $363 million of exchanged subordinated notes became part of the carrying value of the new subordinated 44 Table of Contents notes. The remaining portion of that valuation adjustment, which is being amortized to interest expense over the period to expected maturity of the new notes, was $14 million at December 31, 2006. Including the impact of such amortization, the new subordinated notes have an effective rate of 7.76%. The $137 million notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement that was not terminated continues to hedge the remaining $137 million of 8.0% subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long term borrowings were $712 million, $711 million and $710 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. From June 30, 2004 to June 30, 2006, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate seventeen times, each increase representing a 25 basis point increment over the previously effective target rate. Specifically, during the first half of 2006, four increases were initiated; during 2005, eight increases occurred; and in the second half of 2004, the target federal funds rate was raised five times. In such a rising interest rate environment, rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, most notably short term borrowings, have risen more rapidly than have the yields on earning assets. The result of these conditions was a contraction of the net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, which declined 22 basis points from 3.32% in 2005 to 3.10% in 2006. The yield on earning assets during 2006 was 6.71%, 88 basis points higher than 5.83% in 2005, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 110 basis points to 3.61% from 2.51% in 2005. The yield on the Companys earning assets rose 70 basis points in 2005 from 5.13% in 2004, while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in 2005 was up 98 basis points from 1.53% in 2004. As a result, the Companys net interest spread decreased from 3.60% in 2004 to 3.32% in 2005. Net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets, including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest free funds averaged $8.2 billion in 2006, compared with $8.6 billion in 2005 and $8.3 billion in 2004. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.1 billion in 2006 and 2004, and $3.0 billion in 2005. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.1 billion in 2006, $1.0 billion in 2005 and $974 million in 2004. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was .60% in 2006, .45% in 2005 and .28% in 2004. The rise in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2006 and 2005 as compared with the immediately preceding years resulted largely from the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.70% in 2006, compared with 3.77% in 2005 and 3.88% in 2004. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin. Through the second quarter of 2006, the Companys net interest margin had been declining since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in June 2004. During the last half of 2006, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and the Companys net interest margin stabilized. Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes at December 31, 2006 was $1.0 billion. Under the terms of these swap 45 Table of Contents agreements, the Company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates and makes payments at variable rates. As of December 31, 2006, all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges. Additional information about those swap agreements and the items being hedged is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately $15 million and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $80 million in 2006, down from $88 million in 2005 and $95 million in 2004. Net loan charge offs declined to $68 million in 2006 from $77 million and $82 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .16% in 2006, compared with .19% in 2005 and .22% in 2004. A summary of the Companys loan charge offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.

The increase in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2006 from a year earlier was largely due to the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers totaling approximately $41 million. The lower level of nonperforming loans at the 47 Table of Contents 2005 year end as compared with a year earlier reflects an overall improvement in borrower repayment performance. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $111 million or .26% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2006, compared with $129 million or .32% at December 31, 2005 and $155 million or .40% at December 31, 2004. Those loans included loans guaranteed by government related entities of $77 million, $106 million and $121 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government related entities and totaled $65 million at December 31, 2006, $79 million at December 31, 2005 and $104 million at December 31, 2004. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export Import Bank of the United States that totaled $11 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $26 million and $17 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.

Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys commercial real estate loan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Net charge offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $20 million in each of 2006 and 2004, compared with $26 million in 2005. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases were $79 million at December 31, 2006, $39 million a year earlier and $45 million at December 31, 2004. As noted earlier, 48 Table of Contents the increase in such loans from the 2005 year end to December 31, 2006 largely reflects the addition of four relationships with automobile dealers aggregating $41 million. Continued slowing of domestic automobile sales in 2006 has resulted in a difficult operating environment for certain automobile dealers, leading to deteriorating financial results. Net charge offs of commercial real estate loans during 2006 were $1 million, compared with net recoveries of $1 million in 2005 and net charge offs of $3 million in 2004. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonperforming totaled $57 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $44 million at December 31, 2005 and $45 million at December 31, 2004. The increase from the end of 2005 to the 2006 year end was largely due to the addition of a $10 million loan to an assisted living facility. Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries, were $4 million in each of 2006 and 2004, compared with $2 million in 2005. Nonperforming residential real estate loans at the 2006 year end totaled $42 million, compared with $29 million and $44 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $92 million, $96 million and $127 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government related entities. Net charge offs of consumer loans and leases during 2006 totaled $43 million, representing .43% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $50 million or .47% in 2005 and $55 million or .49% in 2004. Indirect automobile loans and leases represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge offs in each of the past three years. Net charge offs of indirect automobile loans and leases were $24 million during 2006, and $37 million during each of 2005 and 2004. Nonperforming consumer loans and leases were $46 million at December 31, 2006, representing .46% of outstanding consumer loans and leases, compared with $44 million or .42% at December 31, 2005 and $38 million or .35% at December 31, 2004. Consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $3 million at December 31, 2006, $1 million at December 31, 2005 and $2 million at December 31, 2004. Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (iii) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis. Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2006 in light of (i) the sluggish pace of economic growth in many of the markets served by the Company; (ii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania; and (iii) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies. Although the national economy experienced moderate growth in 2006 with inflation being reasonably well contained, concerns exist about the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakening housing market, particularly concerns about possible over valued real estate; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans resulting from a higher level of interest rates; 49 Table of Contents sluggish job creation, which could cause consumer spending to slow; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; continued slowing of domestic automobile sales; and modest loan demand in many market areas served by the Company. In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. The total allowance for credit losses, therefore, includes both specific and inherent base level loss components, as well as inherent unallocated loss components. The following paragraphs describe these components. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended, are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114 when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loans less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired for purposes of applying SFAS No. 114. The inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral value, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. To better classify inherent losses by specific loan categories, beginning in 2006 amounts previously included in the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as for certain national and local economic conditions have been included in the inherent base level loss component. As a result, probable losses resulting from (i) comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, that resulted in such regions experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans, have been included in the inherent base level loss components at December 31, 2006. In evaluating collateral value, the Company relies extensively on internally and externally prepared valuations. Such valuations, in particular commercial real estate valuations, utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values in the New York City 50 Table of Contents metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes in assigned loan grades due to the elapse of time between the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality and, accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were mixed during 2006. Private sector job growth in the upstate New York market was 0.2%, or well below the 1.5% national average. The manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of Buffalo, Rochester and Binghamton continued to experience weakness, including continued industrial downsizing. Job growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company and in Maryland matched the national average. The results for the Pennsylvania markets are particularly noteworthy since job growth in that region had significantly lagged national averages for several years prior to 2006. Job growth in New York City (1.8%) and the Greater Washington D.C. region (3.0%), particularly northern Virginia (3.6%), was higher than the national average in 2006. These mixed signals on private sector job growth, combined with concerns about inflation, higher interest rates, high levels of consumer indebtedness, high and volatile energy prices, weak population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions that lagged national population growth trends and other factors, continue to indicate to management an environment of economic uncertainty, particularly in the markets served by the Company in New York and Pennsylvania where more than two thirds of its lending business is conducted. The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. The inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as; (i) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (ii) the introduction of new loan and lease product types, including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions; and (iii) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance. A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in table 12. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components, including in 2006, the allocation of losses that were previously unallocated for such things as customer, industry and geographic concentrations, certain national and local economic conditions, and other factors. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 114 were $153 million at December 31, 2006 and $93 million at December 31, 2005. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $23 million at December 31, 2006 and $15 million at December 31, 2005. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .21% and .51% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses from year end 2005 to December 31, 2006 was largely attributable to the factors described herein. Given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in New York State, including the upstate New York region, and central Pennsylvania, and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and 51 Table of Contents reasonable. Nevertheless, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category. Table 12 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES December 31 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc $ 212,945 $ 136,852 $ 147,550 $ 186,902 $ 120,627 Real estate 221,747 161,003 166,910 170,493 152,758 Consumer 124,675 133,541 148,591 152,759 113,711 Unallocated 90,581 206,267 163,813 103,904 49,376 Total $ 649,948 $ 637,663 $ 626,864 $ 614,058 $ 436,472 As a Percentage of Gross Loans and Leases Outstanding Commercial, financial, agricultural, etc 1.79 % 1.23 % 1.45 % 1.99 % 2.23 % Real estate 1.04 .85 .96 1.10 1.17 Consumer 1.26 1.27 1.33 1.37 1.51 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2006 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $650 million or 1.51% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2006, compared with $638 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2005 and $627 million or 1.63% at December 31, 2004. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases from the 2005 year end to December 31, 2006 reflects managements evaluation of the loan portfolio as described herein, including a change in portfolio mix resulting from higher balances of residential real estate loans and lower balances of consumer loans. In general, the Company experiences significantly lower charge off rates on residential real estate loans than on consumer loans. The decline in the level of the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 also reflects improvement in certain credit factors, including decreases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 290%, 408% and 364%, respectively. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date. In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows the methodology described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality: For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 10 basis point increase in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower ranked risk grades resulting in a 30% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. 52 Table of Contents For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were: For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors; For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5 basis point decrease in loss factors; and For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade. The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $48 million in losses that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement an $18 million reduction in such losses could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors. Commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily properties and properties used in providing retail goods and services in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% and 5%, respectively, of loans outstanding at December 31, 2006. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2006. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $176 million at December 31, 2006, or .4% of total loans and leases. Assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $9 million and $13 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Income Other income rose 10% to $1.05 billion in 2006 from $950 million in 2005. Higher levels of mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts, trust income, brokerage services income, and other revenues contributed to that improvement. As discussed previously, included in other income for 2006 was a $13 million gain from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of a $200 million borrowing from the FHLB of Atlanta. In addition, other income in 2005 reflects the already discussed $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to the Companys investment in certain preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities from both years and the $13 million gain on the called borrowing in 2006, other income increased 5% from 2005 to 2006. Other income in 2005 was 1% above the $943 million earned in 2004. Higher mortgage banking revenues, corporate financing advisory fees, gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property, and other revenues were offset by losses from investment securities, which reflect the $29 million impairment charge. Excluding gains and losses from investment securities, other income in 2005 rose $38 million or 4% from 2004. Mortgage banking revenues were $143 million in 2006, compared with $136 million in 2005 and $124 million in 2004. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities is largely comprised of the origination, sales and servicing of loans in conjunction with the FNMA DUS program. Residential mortgage banking revenues, which consist of gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan related fees and income, increased 7% to $114 million in 2006 from $107 million in 2005. Higher revenue from servicing residential mortgage loans for others was the leading factor in the improvement. Residential mortgage banking revenues in 2005 were 7% higher than the $100 million earned in 2004. Higher origination activity was the most significant factor contributing to that increase. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $6.4 billion in 2006, compared with $6.5 billion in 2005 and $4.8 billion in 2004. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $41 million in 2006, compared with $42 million in 2005, and $32 million in 2004. On May 1, 2005, the Company assumed the operations of Regions Financial Corporations wholesale residential mortgage business. Those operations added 13 locations and 53 Table of Contents approximately 140 employees to the Companys residential mortgage banking business. Approximately $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion of residential mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005, respectively, for sale to other investors were related to the assumed operations. Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others rose to $66 million in 2006 from $58 million in 2005 and $57 million in 2004. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $14 million, $10 million and $6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $16.7 billion at December 31, 2006, $15.6 billion a year earlier and $14.9 billion at December 31, 2004, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $3.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $153 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $140 million and $133 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $36 million, $23 million and $13 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented herein under the heading Other Expense and in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements. Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre determined rates were $1.8 billion and $680 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, $923 million and $352 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $764 million and $422 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on hedged residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively, compared with net unrealized losses of $5 million at December 31, 2005. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in a net increase in revenue of $2 million in 2006, and net decreases in revenue of $8 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004. Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $29 million in each of 2006 and 2005, compared with $25 million in 2004. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $15 million in 2006, compared with $14 million during 2005 and $13 million in 2004. Loan servicing revenues totaled $14 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $12 million in 2004. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets totaled $21 million at each of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and $22 million at December 31, 2004. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $4.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and included $939 million, $941 million and $926 million, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $115 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, $241 million and $42 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $167 million and $106 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $49 million, $199 million and $61 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 3% to $381 million in 2006 from $370 million in 2005. Deposit account service charges in 2004 were $366 million. The higher levels of such revenues in 2006 and 2005 as compared with the immediately preceding years resulted from increased consumer service charges, largely resulting from higher debit card transaction volumes and overdraft fees, partially offset by lower commercial service charges. Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income rose 5% to $141 million in 2006 from $135 million in 2005, due in part to higher personal trust revenues. Trust income totaled $136 million in 2004. The impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds caused the decline in revenues from 2004 to 2005. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, aggregated $142.4 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $134.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Trust assets under management were $14.8 billion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 54 Table of Contents 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $60 million in 2006, up 8% from $56 million in 2005, primarily the result of increased revenues from the sale of annuities. Brokerage services income was $54 million in 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was due largely to increased revenues earned from the sale of mutual funds. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $25 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $19 million in 2004. The higher gains in 2006 as compared with 2005 resulted largely from net increases in the market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans. The increased gains in 2005 as compared with 2004 were due in part to higher volumes of trading assets and liabilities and reflected fees and market value changes related to interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $15 million in each of 2006 and 2005, and were $11 million in 2004. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $45 million and $41 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of such assets were $5 million in 2006, $3 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004. A largely offsetting expense resulting from corresponding increases in liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations. Gains on investment securities were $3 million in each of 2006 and 2004, while as a result of the previously described charge for the other than temporary impairment in value of the FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock, losses on investment securities aggregated $28 million during 2005. Other revenues from operations were $293 million in 2006, up from $259 million in 2005 and $240 million in 2004. Significant contributors to the 13% rise in such revenues from 2005 to 2006 were the previously noted $13 million gain from the call of an FHLB borrowing and an increase of $9 million in insurance related revenues, largely the result of the February 1, 2006 acquisition by M&T Bank of a commercial insurance and surety brokerage agency based in Maryland. Also contributing to the increase from 2005 to 2006 were higher income from educational lending services of $8 million and income from bank owned life insurance of $6 million. An increase of $5 million in revenues from providing corporate financing advisory services and a $7 million increase in gains on sales of commercial lease equipment and other property contributed to the higher revenues in 2005 as compared with 2004. Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit related fees totaled $77 million, $75 million and $74 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Tax exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $53 million, $47 million and $48 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $32 million in 2006, $30 million in 2005 and $28 million in 2004. Insurance related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $32 million in 2006, compared with $22 million in each of 2005 and 2004. The higher revenues in 2006 as compared with the preceding two years was primarily the result of the already noted insurance agency acquisition in February 2006. Automated teller machine (ATM) usage fees aggregated $15 million in 2006, compared with $22 million in 2005 and in 2004. The decrease in such fees in 2006 was largely the result of the reduction or elimination of fees charged for use of ATMs at certain non branch locations. Other Expense Other expense totaled $1.55 billion in 2006, compared with $1.49 billion in 2005 and $1.52 billion in 2004. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $63 million, $57 million and $75 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and merger related integration expenses of $5 million in 2006. There 55 Table of Contents were no merger related expenses in either 2005 or 2004. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.48 billion in 2006, up 4% from $1.43 billion in 2005. Included in 2006s operating expenses was the $18 million charitable contribution already discussed. Excluding the impact of the charitable contribution, operating expenses in 2006 increased $37 million, or less than 3% from 2005, due primarily to higher salaries costs, including merit pay increases and incentive compensation. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.44 billion in 2004. As previously noted, such expenses reflect a $25 million charitable contribution. Excluding that contribution, operating expenses in 2005 increased $13 million, or less than 1%, from 2004. That increase from 2004 resulted from higher costs of providing health care and retirement benefits to employees and increased professional services expenses, partially offset by a higher reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, due to higher residential mortgage loan interest rates. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $873 million in 2006, up 6% from $822 million in 2005. The most significant contributor to the increase was a higher level of salaries expense in 2006, reflecting the impact of merit pay increases and higher stock based compensation costs and other incentive pay. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $807 million in 2004. Expenses related to providing employee health care and retirement benefits were the most significant contributors to the rise in salaries and benefits from 2004 to 2005. The Company recognizes expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting for all stock based compensation granted to employees after January 1, 1995. As a result, salaries and employee benefits expense in 2006, 2005 and 2004 included $51 million, $45 million and $48 million, respectively, of stock based compensation. The higher level of stock based compensation in 2006 was largely due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), effective January 1, 2006. As required, coincident with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company began accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and employees who will become retirement eligible prior to full vesting of the award. As a result, stock based compensation expense during 2006 included $4 million that would otherwise have been recognized over the normal four year vesting period if not for the required adoption of SFAS No. 123R. That acceleration had no effect on the value of stock based compensation awarded to employees. The number of full time equivalent employees was 12,721 at December 31, 2006, compared with 12,780 and 12,678 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pension benefit expense is a significant cost to the Company and totaled $28 million in 2006, $38 million in 2005 and $30 million in 2004. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The expense for 2006 includes $7 million related to a new qualified defined contribution plan introduced on January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment. The Companys 2006 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long term rate of return on assets of 8.50%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.90%; and a discount rate of 5.50%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to 56 Table of Contents changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $1 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $.5 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $3 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans reflects the long term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $101 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $8 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $2 million in 2004. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 requires that gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to SFAS No. 87 or SFAS No. 106, be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the combined benefit obligations (as defined under SFAS No. 158) of the Companys defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $205 million. Of that amount, $96 million was related to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and $109 million related to non qualified pension and other postretirement plans that are generally not funded until benefits are paid. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to have a net pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans that was at least equal to $205 million at December 31, 2006. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2006 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of $46 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby stockholders equity) by $28 million. Because the recognition requirements of SFAS No. 158 were required to be applied at the end of the year of adoption, the Company had to first recognize the additional minimum liability amounts required under the provisions of SFAS No. 87. As a result, as of December 31, 2006 the Company decreased its previously recorded minimum pension liability by $51 million with a corresponding increase to other comprehensive income that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $31 million. A combination of better than expected investment returns on plan assets during 2006 and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption to 5.75% at December 31, 2006 from 5.50% at December 31, 2005 were the significant factors contributing to the increase to other comprehensive income recorded in 2006 under the provisions of SFAS No. 87. In order to recognize the funded status of the Companys other combined defined benefit postretirement plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 158, the Company then recorded an incremental minimum liability of approximately $16 million with a corresponding reduction of stockholders equity that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $10 million. As a result, including the effects of adopting SFAS No. 158, the Company decreased its minimum liability from that which was recorded at December 31, 2005 by approximately $35 million with a corresponding increase to 57 Table of Contents stockholders equity that, net of applicable deferred taxes, was approximately $21 million. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 158, a 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2006 to 5.50% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans) of $25 million. Under that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment at December 31, 2006 would have been $71 million, rather than the $46 million that was actually recorded, and the corresponding after tax effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 would have been $44 million, rather than the $28 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 6.00% would have decreased the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by $24 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate liability adjustment at December 31, 2006 would have been $22 million rather than the $46 million actually recorded and the corresponding after tax effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been $14 million rather than $28 million. The Company made contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2006 totaling approximately $36 million. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company amended certain provisions of its defined benefit pension plans. Such amendments had the effect of reducing future benefits earned under the plans. The formula was changed to reduce the future accrual of benefits by lowering the accrual percentage and through use of a career average pay formula as opposed to the previous final average pay formula. The amendments affected benefits earned for service periods beginning after December 31, 2005. Active participants at that time had the choice of electing to remain in the defined benefit plan under the reduced benefit formula or electing to participate in a new qualified defined contribution pension plan. Under the new defined contribution pension plan, the Company makes contributions to the plan each year in an amount that is based on an individual participants total compensation (generally defined as total wages, incentive compensation, commissions and bonuses) and years of service. Participants do not contribute to the defined contribution pension plan. New employees are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan, but do participate in the defined contribution pension plan. The amendment caused the projected benefit obligation associated with the defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately $98 million as of December 31, 2005. Certain gains associated with the $98 million in pension benefit obligation reduction attributable to employees who remained in the plan are not subject to the ten percent corridor previously noted. Guidance contained in SFAS No. 87 requires that these gains be amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining expected service period for active employees. Amortization of these gains had the effect of reducing the Companys pension expense for 2006 by approximately $7 million. In addition to the changes described above, the Company also amended its retirement savings plan (RSP), effective January 1, 2006, to allow for greater amounts of employee compensation to be eligible for contribution to the RSP. The RSP is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $21 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005 and $16 million in 2004. As a result of the amendments to the defined benefit pension plans and the RSP and the introduction of the defined contribution pension plan, the Company hoped to limit increases in future period expenses associated with these plans. Reflecting the impact of these changes, expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $49 million in 2006, compared with $55 million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004. Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses aggregated $611 million in 2006, up 1% from $606 million in 2005. That increase reflects the $18 million charitable contribution made in 2006. Exclusive of the contribution, nonpersonnel operating expenses decreased $13 million or 2% from 2005, due largely to lower costs for professional services, furniture and equipment. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $634 million in 2004 and included a $25 million charitable contribution. Excluding the impact of that contribution, other nonpersonnel operating 58 Table of Contents expenses in 2005 decreased $3 million from 2004. As compared with 2004, a $7 million higher reversal in 2005 of a portion of the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights, and lower equipment, net occupancy and other operating expenses were partially offset by higher professional services costs. The higher expenses incurred for professional services in 2005 were due in part to several initiatives of the Company, including projects focused on procurement practices, consolidation of loan application systems, revenue enhancement opportunities and operational efficiencies, as well as costs related to the already discussed subordinated note exchange. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $392 million in 2006, compared with $389 million in 2005 and $344 million in 2004. The effective tax rates were 31.9%, 33.2% and 32.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decline in the Companys effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 reflects higher levels of income that were exempt from tax in certain jurisdictions and a $3 million favorable impact from settlement of refund claims originally filed by Allfirst Financial Inc. prior to its April 1, 2003 acquisition by M&T. The refunds received, consisting of income taxes and taxable interest, exceeded the amounts previously accrued for such items by $5 million (pre tax). The increase in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 was largely due to the impact of the third quarter 2004 reorganization of two of the Companys subsidiaries that altered the taxable status of such subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions thereby decreasing the Companys effective state income tax rate for 2004. As a result of the reorganizations, both income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2004 were reduced by $12 million. The effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations attributable to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any changes in income tax regulations or interpretations of such regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by tax authorities within those jurisdictions, and the impact of changes in the accounting for income taxes resulting from the required adoption on January 1, 2007 of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The projected impact of that adoption is included herein under the heading Recent Accounting Developments. A reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements. International Activities The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $185 million at December 31, 2006 and $230 million at December 31, 2005. Such assets included $176 million and $217 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable. Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company, and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, in recent years the Company has faced increased competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 57% of the Companys earning assets at each of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, compared with 59% at December 31, 2004. The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs 59 Table of Contents and others. At December 31, 2006, M&T Bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $6.8 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $3.4 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of approximately $4.3 billion at December 31, 2006. The amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either December 31, 2006 or 2005. The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. M&T Bank issued $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2006. The notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 5.629% for ten years and a floating rate thereafter, at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable at the Companys option after the fixed rate period ends, subject to prior regulatory approval. In December 2005, M&T Bank exchanged $363 million of its 8.0% subordinated notes due 2010 for new fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes with a par value of $409 million due 2020. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.585% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.215%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at the Companys option, subject to regulatory approval. No new funding was received as a result of the exchange. A more detailed description of the 2006 and 2005 subordinated note transactions is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. As an additional source of funding, in November 2002, the Company entered into a $500 million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately $565 million of automobile loans and related assets. The automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of M&T Bank. As existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down, monthly proceeds, after payment of certain fees and debt service costs, are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from M&T Bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base. Additional information about this borrowing is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short term federal funds borrowings were $2.3 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, those borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to short term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally mature on the next business day and totaled $5.4 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Brokered certificates of deposit have longer maturity terms. Information regarding such deposits is included under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities. The Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 13. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short term and long term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services. 60 Table of Contents Table 13 DEBT RATINGS Standard Moodys and Poors Fitch M&T Bank Corporation Senior debt A3 A A Subordinated debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ M&T Bank Short term deposits Prime 1 A 1 F1 Long term deposits A2 A A Senior debt A2 A A Subordinated debt A3 A BBB+ Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time to time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $6 million and $58 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.7 billion. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual obligations which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2006 are summarized in table 15. Off balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 15 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2006 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments. 61 Table of Contents Table 15 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS Less Than One One to Three Three to Five Over Five December 31, 2006 Year Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Payments due for contractual obligations Time deposits $ 9,426,681 $ 1,642,369 $ 331,423 $ 90,156 $ 11,490,629 Deposits at foreign office 5,429,668 5,429,668 Federal funds purchased and agreements to repurchase securities 2,531,684 2,531,684 Other short term borrowings 562,530 562,530 Long term borrowings 518,543 2,806,147 532,807 3,033,244 6,890,741 Operating leases 43,931 74,784 48,829 66,757 234,301 Other 18,968 19,131 11,139 34,328 83,566 Total $ 18,532,005 $ 4,542,431 $ 924,198 $ 3,224,485 $ 27,223,119 Other commitments Commitments to extend credit $ 6,820,835 $ 4,317,118 $ 4,220,081 $ 1,683,461 $ 17,041,495 Standby letters of credit 1,471,079 1,192,282 752,319 207,180 3,622,860 Commercial letters of credit 25,626 1,110 3,473 30,209 Financial guarantees and indemnification contracts 19,194 78,762 159,882 778,279 1,036,117 Commitments to sell real estate loans 1,932,306 1,932,306 Total $ 10,269,040 $ 5,589,272 $ 5,135,755 $ 2,668,920 $ 23,662,987 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and common stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, approximately $108 million at December 31, 2006 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities. Information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2005. 62 Table of Contents Table 16 MATURITY AND TAXABLE EQUIVALENT YIELD OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES One Year One to Five Five to Ten Over Ten December 31, 2006 or Less Years Years Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Investment securities available for sale(a) U.S. Treasury and federal agencies Carrying value $ 29,524 $ 236,351 $ 206,489 $ 1,512 $ 473,876 Yield 3.17 % 3.72 % 6.11 % 4.48 % 4.73 % Obligations of states and political subdivisions Carrying value 13,131 16,855 33,669 7,116 70,771 Yield 5.70 % 6.14 % 4.77 % 7.94 % 5.59 % Mortgage backed securities(b) Government issued or guaranteed Carrying value 142,696 523,737 528,114 713,161 1,907,708 Yield 3.70 % 3.82 % 3.94 % 4.78 % 4.20 % Privately issued Carrying value 88,152 374,667 373,319 2,960,392 3,796,530 Yield 4.23 % 4.96 % 5.15 % 4.92 % 4.93 % Other debt securities Carrying value 3,991 10,154 3,504 132,258 149,907 Yield 4.92 % 4.78 % 5.27 % 7.03 % 6.78 % Equity securities Carrying value 431,056 Yield 5.48 % Total investment securities available for sale Carrying value 277,494 1,161,764 1,145,095 3,814,439 6,829,848 Yield 3.92 % 4.21 % 4.75 % 4.97 % 4.79 % Investment securities held to maturity Obligations of states and political subdivisions Carrying value 42,166 6,815 9,319 1,136 59,436 Yield 5.64 % 7.08 % 9.63 % 7.79 % 6.47 % Other debt securities Carrying value 467 4,996 5,463 Yield 8.30 % 5.59 % 5.82 % Total investment securities held to maturity Carrying value 42,166 6,815 9,786 6,132 64,899 Yield 5.64 % 7.08 % 9.57 % 6.00 % 6.42 % Other investment securities 356,851 Total investment securities Carrying value $ 319,660 $ 1,168,579 $ 1,154,881 $ 3,820,571 $ 7,251,598 Yield 4.15 % 4.23 % 4.79 % 4.97 % 4.57 % (a) Investment securities available for sale are presented at estimated fair value.

Actual maturities are expected to be significantly shorter as a result of loan repayments in the underlying mortgage pools. Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks. 63 Table of Contents Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which the Company is exposed. Interest rate risk arises from the Companys core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and non parallel shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $1.0 billion. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 MATURITY OF DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH BALANCES OF $100,000 OR MORE December 31, 2006 (In thousands) Under 3 months $ 2,478,317 3 to 6 months 1,561,755 6 to 12 months 634,145 Over 12 months 863,789 Total $ 5,538,006 The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 64 Table of Contents Table 18 displays as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year. Table 18 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES Calculated Increase (Decrease) in Projected Net Interest Income December 31 Changes in Interest Rates 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) + 200 basis points $ 15,098 $ (7,178 ) + 100 basis points 13,260 (4,096 ) 100 basis points (12,759 ) (5,733 ) 200 basis points (26,546 ) (16,184 ) The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income. In accordance with industry practice, table 19 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement. 65 Table of Contents Table 19 CONTRACTUAL REPRICING DATA Three Months Four to Twelve One to After December 31, 2006 or Less Months Five Years Five Years Total (Dollars in thousands) Loans and leases, net $ 20,521,055 $ 3,684,677 $ 10,330,431 $ 8,411,134 $ 42,947,297 Investment securities 624,657 593,873 3,702,936 2,330,132 7,251,598 Other earning assets 179,135 850 179,985 Total earning assets 21,324,847 4,279,400 14,033,367 10,741,266 50,378,880 NOW accounts 940,439 940,439 Savings deposits 14,169,790 14,169,790 Time deposits 5,817,393 4,375,761 1,246,242 51,233 11,490,629 Deposits at foreign office 5,428,596 1,072 5,429,668 Total interest bearing deposits 26,356,218 4,376,833 1,246,242 51,233 32,030,526 Short term borrowings 3,094,214 3,094,214 Long term borrowings 3,215,107 198,353 837,359 2,639,922 6,890,741 Total interest bearing liabilities 32,665,539 4,575,186 2,083,601 2,691,155 42,015,481 Interest rate swaps (922,241 ) 205,000 177,241 540,000 Periodic gap $ (12,262,933 ) $ (90,786 ) $ 12,127,007 $ 8,590,111 Cumulative gap (12,262,933 ) (12,353,719 ) (226,712 ) 8,363,399 Cumulative gap as a % of total earning assets (24.3 )% (24.5 )% (0.5 )% 16.6 % The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage backed securities, mutual funds and interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities. The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes aggregated $7.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $613 million and $679 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities were $137 million and $65 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and $192 million and $77 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $45 million and $41 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $49 million and $48 million, respectively, of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of 66 Table of Contents such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income. Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions associated with the Companys trading activities. Additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements. Capital Stockholders equity at December 31, 2006 totaled $6.3 billion and represented 11.01% of total assets, compared with $5.9 billion or 10.66% at December 31, 2005 and $5.7 billion or 10.82% at December 31, 2004. On a per share basis, stockholders equity was $56.94 at December 31, 2006, up 9% from $52.39 at the 2005 year end and 15% higher than $49.68 at December 31, 2004. Tangible equity per share was $28.57 at December 31, 2006, compared with $25.91 and $23.62 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the calculation of tangible equity per common share, stockholders equity is reduced by the carrying values of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, net of applicable deferred tax balances. A reconciliation of total stockholders equity and tangible equity as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented in table 2. The ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.82%, 10.71% and 11.07% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale; unrealized fair value gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges; minimum pension liability adjustments; and the impact of applying SFAS No. 158. Net unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities were $25 million, or $.23 per common share, at December 31, 2006, compared with losses of $49 million, or $.43 per common share, at December 31, 2005 and $5 million, or $.04 per common share, at December 31, 2004. Such unrealized losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, included in accumulated other comprehensive income reduced stockholders equity by $28 million at December 31, 2006, or $.26 per share. Similar adjustments to recognize minimum pension liabilities as then required by SFAS No. 87, net of applicable tax effect, reduced stockholders equity by $49 million or $.44 per share at December 31, 2005 and $12 million or $.11 per share at December 31, 2004. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. Cash dividends paid in 2006 on M&Ts common stock totaled $250 million, compared with $199 million and $188 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the second quarter of 2005 from $.40 to $.45 per share, and again in the second quarter of 2006 to $.60 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $2.25 in 2006, up 29% from $1.75 in 2005 and 41% above $1.60 in 2004. M&T repurchased 3,259,000 shares of its common stock in 2006, 4,891,800 shares in 2005 and 6,520,800 shares in 2004, at a cost of $374 million, $510 million and $610 million, respectively. In December 2004, M&T had announced a plan to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. That repurchase plan was completed in December 2005. In November 2005, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Through December 31, 2006, M&T had repurchased a total of 3,303,700 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $114.66 per share. Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 67 Table of Contents 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2006, core capital included $689 million of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements and total capital further included $1.4 billion of subordinated capital notes. As previously noted, in December 2006, M&T Bank issued $500 million of fixed rate/floating rate subordinated notes due 2021. The new notes bear interest at a fixed coupon rate of 5.629% for ten years, while thereafter such notes will bear interest at a floating rate that resets monthly at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus .64%. The notes are redeemable after the fixed rate period ends at M&Ts option, subject to regulatory approval. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 are presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company generates significant amounts of regulatory capital. The rate of regulatory core capital generation, or net operating income (as previously defined) less the sum of dividends paid and the after tax effect of merger related expenses expressed as a percentage of regulatory core capital at the beginning of each year, was 17.52% in 2006, 18.50% in 2005 and 18.12% in 2004. Fourth Quarter Results Net income increased 4% to $213 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 from $205 million in the year earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per share were $1.88 and $1.93, respectively, in the final quarter of 2006, compared with $1.78 and $1.82, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2006 were 1.50% and 13.55%, respectively, compared with 1.48% and 13.85%, respectively, in the year earlier period. Net operating income rose 6% to $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $213 million in 2005s final quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share increased 7% to $1.98 in the recently completed quarter from $1.85 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity were 1.67% and 28.71%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with 1.63% and 29.12%, respectively, in the corresponding 2005 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $11 million ($.10 per diluted share) and $8 million ($.07 per diluted share) in the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2006 and 2005 are provided in table 21. Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 4% to $472 million in the final quarter of 2006 from $454 million in the year earlier quarter. That growth was the result of a 3% increase in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $50.2 billion in the last quarter of 2006, compared with $48.8 billion in the year earlier period. Average loans and leases for the recently completed quarter totaled $42.5 billion, up 5% from $40.4 billion during the final quarter of 2005. A $1.1 billion increase in commercial real estate loans, an $863 million rise in residential real estate loans, and a $786 million increase in commercial loans were the leading contributors to the growth in average loans outstanding. The yield on earning assets was 6.92% in the fourth quarter of 2006, up 76 basis points from 6.16% in the fourth quarter of 2005. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 3.83% in the last quarter of 2006, 85 basis points higher than 2.98% in the corresponding period in 2005. The resulting net interest spread was 3.09% in the recent quarter, down 9 basis points from 3.18% in the fourth quarter of 2005. That decline reflects the impact of higher interest rates in 2006 that resulted in short term interest rates associated with borrowings and many deposits rising more than longer term interest rates associated with many loan products. However, the contribution of net interest free funds to the Companys net interest margin rose to .64% in the final 2006 quarter from .51% in the year earlier quarter. That rise reflects the impact of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. As a result, the Companys net interest margin improved to 3.73% in the recent quarter from 3.69% in the final quarter of 2005. The provision for credit losses was $28 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2006, compared with $23 million in the year earlier period. Net charge offs of loans were $24 million in 2006s fourth quarter, representing an annualized .23% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $23 million or .22% during the final three months of 2005. 68 Table of Contents Other income totaled $256 million in the final quarter of 2006, up 3% from $249 million in the year earlier quarter, due in part to higher revenues from trust and brokerage services activities, service charges on deposit accounts and income from bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues. Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 4% to $384 million from $369 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $19 million and $13 million in the final quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $365 million in the recently completed quarter, up 2% from $356 million in the last three months of 2005. Higher costs for salaries and a $1 million increase to the valuation allowance for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with a reversal of a portion of such valuation allowance of $6 million in the year earlier quarter, were the leading contributors to that rise in operating expense. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005 was 50.2% and 50.7%, respectively. Table 21 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2006 and 2005. Segment Information In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking and Retail Banking. The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers, largely within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, deposit products, and cash management services. Net income earned by the Commercial Banking segment rose 3% to $226 million in 2006 from $219 million in 2005. That improvement was primarily the result of a $25 million rise in net interest income, partially offset by increased noninterest expenses, most significantly higher personnel costs of $7 million. The higher net interest income was predominantly due to a widening of the net interest margin and an 8% increase in average loan balances outstanding, offset, in part, by a 17% decrease in average demand deposit balances. In 2004, this segments net income aggregated $213 million. The favorable performance in 2005 as compared to 2004 was due largely to an increase in net interest income of $21 million, mainly the result of a 7% increase in loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a $9 million increase in noninterest expenses, due predominantly to higher personnel costs. The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the FNMA DUS program and other programs. This segment contributed net income of $135 million in 2006, down 6% from the $143 million earned in 2005. The decline was the result of an $8 million 69 Table of Contents decrease in net interest income, predominantly due to a narrowing of net interest margin on loans outstanding, higher noninterest expenses of $6 million and lower commercial mortgage credit related fees and other revenues of $4 million. Net income in 2005 for the Commercial Real Estate segment was 13% above the $126 million earned in 2004. That improvement was due to an increase in net interest income of $19 million that resulted from higher average loan balances and a wider margin associated with deposits, a $4 million rise in commercial mortgage banking revenues and a lower provision for credit losses of $5 million. The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short term and long term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC owned by the Company. The Discretionary Portfolio segment recorded net income of $96 million in 2006, 3% higher than $93 million in 2005. Contributing to that increase were the $29 million other than temporary impairment charge related to preferred stock issuances of FNMA and FHLMC reflected in 2005s results and the $13 million gain in 2006 resulting from the accelerated recognition of a purchase accounting premium related to the call of an FHLB borrowing assumed in a previous acquisition. Partially offsetting these favorable factors was a $39 million decrease in net interest income resulting from a 58 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin on investment securities and a $470 million decline in the average balance of the segments portfolio of investment securities. Net income contributed by the Discretionary Portfolio segment was $112 million in 2004. The 17% decline in 2005 as compared with 2004 was predominantly the result of the previously mentioned other than temporary impairment charge reflected in 2005s results. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans for consumers and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to bank subsidiaries of M&T. This segment also originates and services loans to developers of residential real estate properties. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the southern and western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. The Residential Mortgage Banking segments net income rose 21% to $52 million in 2006 from $43 million in 2005. The improved performance was predominantly due to an 11% increase in noninterest revenues resulting from higher income from servicing mortgage loans of $10 million and increased gains from the sales of loans to the Discretionary Portfolio segment of $9 million. Also contributing to the improvement was an $8 million increase in net interest income, mainly due to a 30% increase in balances of loans held for sale, net of a 52 basis point decline in net interest margin associated with such loan balances. Partially offsetting these favorable factors were higher salaries and benefits expenses of $8 million and other noninterest expenses of $4 million. Included in noninterest expenses were partial reversals of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $10 million and $8 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income for the Residential Mortgage Banking segment totaled $29 million in 2004. The 50% increase in net income from 2004 to 2005 was due predominantly to higher noninterest revenues of $20 million, resulting from loan origination, sales and servicing activities, and higher net interest income of $10 million, attributable primarily to an increase in average loan balances outstanding. Also contributing to the segments improved performance from 2004 to 2005 was the effect of an $8 million partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance recognized during 2005, compared with a $2 million partial reversal of such allowance recognized during 2004. Partially offsetting revenue growth was a $14 million increase in salaries and benefits expenses. Gains from the sales of loans to the Companys Discretionary Portfolio segment were $19 million, $10 million and $9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers and small businesses through several delivery channels which include banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia and Delaware. Effective January 2, 2007, M&T Bank 70 Table of Contents opened its first banking office in New Jersey. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis through M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, student loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), home equity loans and lines of credit, and loans and leases to small businesses. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. Net income for the Retail Banking segment aggregated $410 million in 2006, up 26% from $325 million in 2005. The favorable performance was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $119 million, largely resulting from a widening net interest margin on deposit products. Also contributing to the improvement were higher service charges on deposit accounts of $16 million. The Retail Banking segment recorded net income of $251 million in 2004. The 30% increase from 2004 to 2005 was due predominantly to increases in net interest income of $81 million, largely attributable to an increase in net interest margin on deposit products. Higher service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income of $21 million, lower noninterest expenses of $13 million, and a $10 million decline in the provision for credit losses also contributed to the rise in net income from 2004 to 2005. The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 131, such as the M&T Investment Group, which includes the Companys trust, brokerage and insurance businesses. Also reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of financial institutions, the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses, and, in 2006, acquisition and integration related expenses resulting from the branch acquisition completed by M&T Bank on June 30, 2006. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $80 million, $41 million and $9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments was the main factor for the increased net loss in 2006. Also contributing to the net loss were the previously mentioned $18 million charitable contribution made to The M&T Charitable Foundation and higher charges for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger related expenses incurred as a result of the branch acquisition of $17 million and $5 million, respectively. The higher net loss incurred during 2005 as compared with 2004 resulted largely from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. Noninterest expenses in 2004 were $44 million higher than in 2005, reflecting 2004s $25 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation and a $19 million higher charge for amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets. The 2004 net loss also reflected the $12 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the reorganization of certain of M&Ts subsidiaries. Recent Accounting Developments In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment to FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. As a result, such instruments would be accounted for in one of two ways. Under the first allowable method, an entity would bifurcate the embedded derivative feature and record the bifurcated derivative at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value of the bifurcated derivative would be reported in earnings. As an alternative, an entity could elect not to bifurcate the embedded derivative but instead record the entire financial instrument at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value of the security being reported in earnings. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133 and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year, provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for any interim period for that fiscal year. The Company 71 Table of Contents adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 155 as of January 1, 2007 and does not anticipate that the impact of such adoption will be material to its financial position or results of operations. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS No. 156 defines the situations in which an entity should recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability when it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract. SFAS No. 156 requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value and permits an entity to choose its subsequent measurement method for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities as either the amortization method or fair value measurement method. The amortization method requires that servicing assets and servicing liabilities be amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date. The fair value measurement method requires servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be measured at fair value at each reporting date and requires entities to report changes in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 156 requires prospective adoption as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year, provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements, including interim financial statements, for any period of that fiscal year. An entity may elect to subsequently measure a class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value as of the beginning of any fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year in which the entity adopts this statement. Upon such election, which is irrevocable, the effect of remeasuring an existing class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value should be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Currently, the Company initially measures servicing assets retained in sales and securitization transactions for which it is the transferor under the relative fair value method prescribed in SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, and subsequently measures its servicing assets under the amortization method. The Company has not early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 156 and currently does not intend to adopt the fair value measurement method for any classes of separately recognized servicing assets in 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 156 on January 1, 2007, therefore, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The definition of fair value is clarified by SFAS No. 157 to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. The disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of the measurements on earnings for the period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The provisions generally should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which SFAS No. 157 is applied, with certain provisions required to be applied retrospectively. Many of the Companys assets, liabilities and off balance sheet positions are required to either be accounted for or disclosed using fair value as their relevant measurement attribute. Given the pervasiveness of fair value measurements throughout the Companys financial statements, the Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes the accounting method to be applied to measure uncertainty in income taxes recognized under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position in accordance with FIN No. 48 is a two step process. The first step is recognition, which requires 72 Table of Contents a determination whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is measurement. Under the measurement step, a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets) for that fiscal year. The adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, but will likely increase the Companys effective income tax rate by approximately .75% to 1.0% from what it otherwise would have been. In July 2006, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position No. 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13 2). FSP 13 2 requires that a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease shall be accounted for in accordance with the guidance in paragraph 46 of SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. That is, the projected timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease transaction shall be reviewed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in timing has occurred or is projected to occur. If, during the lease term, the projected timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease is revised, the rate of return and the allocation of income to positive investment years shall be recalculated from inception of the lease following the method described in paragraph 44 of SFAS No. 13. The guidance in FSP 13 2 shall be applied to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FSP 13 2 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FSP 13 2 on January 1, 2007 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. At its September 2006 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a final consensus on Issue 06 04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. The consensus stipulates that an agreement by an employer to share a portion of the proceeds of a life insurance policy with an employee during the postretirement period is a postretirement benefit arrangement required to be accounted for under SFAS No. 106 or Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 12, Omnibus Opinion 1967. The consensus concludes that the purchase of a split dollar life insurance policy does not constitute a settlement under SFAS No. 106 and, therefore, a liability for the postretirement obligation must be recognized under SFAS No. 106 if the benefit is offered under an arrangement that constitutes a plan or under APB No. 12 if it is not part of a plan. Issue 06 04 is effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2007. The provisions of Issue 06 04 should be applied through either a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or retrospective application. The Company has endorsement split dollar life insurance policies that it inherited through certain acquisitions that are associated with employees who are no longer active. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the provisions of Issue 06 04 will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Also at its September 2006 meeting, the EITF reached a final consensus on Issue 06 05, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4. The consensus concludes that in determining the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract accounted for under FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance, the policyholder should (1) consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy; (2) assume the surrender value on a individual life by individual life policy basis; and (3) not discount the cash surrender value component 73 Table of Contents of the amount that could be realized when contractual restrictions on the ability to surrender a policy exist. Issue 06 05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The consensus in Issue 06 05 should be adopted through either (1) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earning as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (2) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods. At December 31, 2006, the Company had bank owned life insurance policies with a carrying value of $1.1 billion. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the provisions of Issue 06 05 on January 1, 2007 will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of the Companys Annual Report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Companys business, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (Future Factors) which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements.
