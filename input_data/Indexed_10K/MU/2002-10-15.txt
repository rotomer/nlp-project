Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Micron Technology, Inc., and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Company") principally design, develop, manufacture and market semiconductor products. The following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements such as those made in "Critical Accounting Policies" and "Income Taxes" regarding the modest levels of foreign taxation that the Company expects to be reflected in the income tax provision in future periods, in "Gross Margin" regarding the estimated amount of write down remaining in inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2003, the estimated gross margins on TECH products in the first quarter of 2003 and the per megabit cost associated with products manufactured at the Companys Virginia facility, and in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" regarding capital spending in 2003. The Companys actual results could differ materially from the Companys historical results and those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in "Certain Factors." This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. All period references are to the Companys fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Per share amounts for 2000 reflect a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on May 1, 2000. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Management believes the critical accounting policies below are the most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Income taxes: The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss 14 carryforwards which will offset taxable income in future periods. U.S. GAAP requires the assessment of the Companys performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. The Companys ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize loss carryforwards or tax credits before their expiration. In the evaluation of realizability of deferred tax assets, factors such as recent losses are given substantially more weight than forecasted future profitability. A valuation allowance was established in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the Companys U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in a $348 million charge to the provision for income taxes. The Company expects that until it utilizes these operating loss carryforwards the consolidated income tax provision will only reflect modest levels of foreign taxation. The Company is also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining market value of inventories requires judgment in that it requires the Company to project unit prices and volumes for future periods in which it expects to sell the inventory. As a result of these analyses, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold to reflect market values that are below the Companys costs. Due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes. As a result, the timing of when product cost are charged to operations can vary significantly. U.S. GAAP provides for inventory to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values. The amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. The majority of the Companys inventory has been categorized as volatile (DRAM and SRAM) or non volatile (Flash). The major characteristics the Company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets. Product and process technology: Costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years. The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patent issuance rates. Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology (the determination of which requires judgment by the Company), (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement. From time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that the Companys products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights. The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement prior to the balance sheet date. However, it is difficult to predict the actual costs of settlement or adjudication. Property, plant and equipment: The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the indicated fair value of the assets. The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the Company, including, but not limited to, future use of the 15 assets for Company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for the Companys products and future sales volumes. Research and development: Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development. Determining when product development is deemed complete requires judgment by the Company. The Company deems that development of a product is complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed, tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory. Recent Events On April 22, 2002, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Toshiba Corporations ("Toshiba") DRAM operations at Dominion Semiconductor L.L.C. in Virginia. The total purchase price of $328 million included cash and 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock. (See "
