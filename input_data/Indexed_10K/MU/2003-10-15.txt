Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements such as those made in "Gross Margin" regarding manufacturing cost reductions in future periods, the estimated amount of write down remaining in inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2004 and relative gross margins on TECH products in the first quarter of 2004; in "Research and Development" regarding expenses related to, and initial product qualifications of, the Companys 300 mm production line; in "Restructure and Other Charges" regarding the effect of the restructure and the estimated cost savings in future periods; "Income Taxes" regarding taxes from the Company foreign operations and in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" regarding achievement of certain milestones associated with the Intel investment and regarding capital spending in 2004. The Companys actual results could differ materially from the Companys historical results and those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in "Certain Factors." This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions. The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 each contained 52 weeks and ended on August 28, 2003, August 29, 2002, and August 30, 2001, respectively. The Companys fiscal 2004, which ends on September 2, 2004, contains 53 weeks and the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ends on December 4, 2003, contains 14 weeks. All period references are to the Companys fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Contingencies: The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. Income taxes: The Company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. Estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year. The Company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of the Companys performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. Realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Companys ability to generate future taxable income. 15 Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, the Company reviews recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information. When these analyses reflect estimated market values below the Companys manufacturing costs, the Company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold. Differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write down recorded. Due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly. For example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated fair value of the Companys inventory by approximately $35 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2003. U.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values. The amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. A majority of the Companys inventory has been categorized as volatile (primarily DRAM) or non volatile (Flash). The major characteristics the Company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets. Product and process technology: Costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the Company are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years. The Company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed. Capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (i) the estimated useful life of the technology, (ii) the patent term or (iii) the term of the technology agreement. Property, plant and equipment: The Company reviews for impairment the carrying value of property, plant and equipment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the Company, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for Company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for the Companys products and future production and sales volumes. In addition, judgment is required by the Company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed. Research and development: Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred. Determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the Company. The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory. 16 Results of Operations 2003 2002 2001 (amounts in millions and as a percent of net sales) Net sales $ 3,091.3 100.0 % $ 2,589.0 100.0 % $ 3,935.9 100.0 % Gross margin (20.7 ) (0.7 )% (110.6 ) (4.3 )% 110.7 2.8 % Selling, general and administrative 358.2 11.6 % 332.3 12.8 % 524.1 13.3 % Research and development 656.4 21.2 % 561.3 21.7 % 489.5 12.4 % Restructure and other charges 116.3 3.8 % Operating loss (1,186.5 ) (38.4 )% (1,025.3 ) (39.6 )% (976.5 ) (24.8 )% The Companys operating results in recent periods have been significantly affected by the timing of inventory write downs and restructure charges.
