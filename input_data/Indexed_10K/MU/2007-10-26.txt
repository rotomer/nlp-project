Overview The Company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices, principally semiconductor memory products (including DRAM and NAND Flash) and CMOS image sensors. The Company operates in two segments: Memory and Imaging. Its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers, workstations, network servers, mobile phones and other consumer applications including Flash memory cards, USB storage devices, digital still cameras, MP3/4 players and in automotive applications. The Company markets its products through its internal sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world. The Companys success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified portfolio of semiconductor memory products, efficient utilization of the Companys manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development investments. The Company is focused on improving its competitiveness by increasing manufacturing scale, improving its cost competitiveness and expanding its product portfolio within the semiconductor memory market. The Company has increased its manufacturing scale in 2007 by ramping NAND Flash production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities and beginning the conversion of another facility to 300mm DRAM wafer fabrication. The Company continues to explore other options to increase its manufacturing scale. To reduce costs, the Company is implementing restructure initiatives aimed at reducing manufacturing and overhead costs through outsourcing, relocation of operations and workforce reductions. In recent years the Company has strategically entered into the NAND Flash memory and specialty DRAM markets and has experienced significant revenue growth from these products. The Company is able to leverage its existing product and process technology and semiconductor memory manufacturing expertise in these markets. To improve its focus on the semiconductor memory market, the Company is exploring business model alternatives for its Imaging business including partnering arrangements. Under any of the alternatives being considered, the Company expects that it will continue to manufacture CMOS image sensors. The Company has partnered with Intel to form two NAND Flash manufacturing joint ventures: IM Flash Technologies, LLC and IM Flash Singapore LLP (collectively IM Flash). IM Flash operations include two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities that are expected to greatly increase the Companys production of NAND Flash in 2008. IM Flash Singapore LLP began construction of a new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Singapore in 2007. The Company expects to contribute approximately $1.7 billion in cash to IM Flash over the next three years, with similar contributions to be made by Intel. Completion of the facility in Singapore is subject to the mutual agreement of the joint venture partners. As of August 30, 2007, the Company owned 51% and Intel owned 49% of IM Flash. The parties share output of IM Flash generally in proportion to their ownership in IM Flash. 26 The Company makes significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in its facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia to manufacture semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs. The Company continues to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption and increased memory density and megapixel count. The Company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as its leading edge line width process technology and innovative array architecture. In order to maximize returns from investments in research and development (R&D), the Company develops process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the Companys capital expenditures. To be successfully incorporated in customers end products, the Company must offer qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications for their end products. In addition, DRAM and NAND Flash products necessarily incorporate highly advanced design and process technologies. The Company must make significant investments in R&D to expand its product offering and develop its leading edge product and process technologies. To leverage its R&D investments, the Company has formed strategic joint ventures under which the costs of developing NAND Flash memory product and process technologies are shared with its joint venture partner. In addition, from time to time, the Company has also sold and or licensed technology to third parties. The Company is pursuing further opportunities to recover its investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. Restructure: The Company is pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across its operations. These initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas of the Company as the Companys business is realigned. Additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to the Companys global customers, evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the Companys overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks. The Company is also exploring opportunities to leverage the Companys technology and diversified product portfolio to increase revenue and shareholder value. It is anticipated that these initiatives will be implemented over several quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company incurred a restructure charge of $19 million in connection with the implementation of these cost reduction initiatives. The fourth quarter charge was comprised primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives, but is currently unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such charges. Results of Operations 2007 2006 2005 (in millions and as a percent of net sales) Net sales: Memory $ 5,001 88 % $ 4,523 86 % $ 4,577 94 % Imaging 687 12 % 749 14 % 303 6 % $ 5,688 100 % $ 5,272 100 % $ 4,880 100 % Gross margin Memory $ 845 17 % $ 878 19 % $ 1,020 22 % Imaging 233 34 % 322 43 % 126 42 % $ 1,078 19 % $ 1,200 23 % $ 1,146 23 % Selling, general and administrative $ 610 11 % $ 460 9 % $ 348 7 % Research and development 805 14 % 656 12 % 604 12 % Restructure 19 0 % (1 ) (0 ) % Other operating (income) expense, net (76 ) (1 ) % (266 ) (5 ) % (22 ) (0 ) % Net income (320 ) (6 ) % 408 8 % 188 4 % The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. 27 Net Sales Total net sales for 2007 increased 8% as compared to 2006 primarily due to an 11% increase in Memory sales partially offset by an 8% decline in Imaging sales. Memory sales for 2007 reflect a 204% increase in megabits sold partially offset by a 64% decline in per megabit average selling prices from 2006. Memory sales were 88% of total net sales in 2007 compared to 86% in 2006 and 94% in 2005. Imaging sales for 2007 decreased 8% from 2006 reflecting industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure. Total net sales for 2006 increased 8% as compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a 147% increase in Imaging sales as Memory sales declined 1%. Memory: Memory sales for 2007 increased 11% from 2006 primarily due to a 287% increase in sales of NAND Flash products offset by an 11% decrease in sales of DRAM products. Sales of NAND Flash products for 2007 increased from 2006 primarily due to significant increases in megabits manufactured and the Companys acquisition of Lexar Media, Inc. (which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006), partially offset by a 56% decline in average selling prices per megabit. Megabit production of NAND Flash products increased over 800% for 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to the ramp of NAND Flash products at the Companys 300mm fabrication facilities and transitions to higher density, advanced geometry devices. Sales of NAND Flash products represented 23% of the Companys total net sales for 2007 as compared to 6% for 2006. The Company expects that sales of NAND Flash products will continue to increase in 2008 as it continues to ramp production capacity at its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities. Sales of DRAM products for 2007 decreased from 2006 primarily due to a 23% decline in average selling prices (which includes the effects of a $50 million charge to revenue in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of a settlement agreement with a class of direct purchasers of certain DRAM products), which was partially mitigated by a 16% increase in megabits sold. Megabit production of DRAM products increased 23% for 2007, primarily due to transitions to higher density, advanced geometry devices. Sales of DDR and DDR2 DRAM products were 47% of the Companys total net sales in 2007 as compared to 51% for 2006 and 59% for 2005. Memory sales for 2006 declined 1% from 2005 as a 287% increase in sales of NAND Flash products was offset by a 5% decrease in sales of DRAM products. Sales of NAND Flash products for 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in megabits sold partially offset by an approximate 35% decline in average selling prices. Sales of NAND Flash products increased significantly for 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing resources allocated to their production. The decrease in sales of DRAM products in 2006 from 2005 was the result of a 22% decline in average selling prices mitigated by a 22% increase in megabits sold. Megabit production of DRAM products increased 14% for 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to production efficiencies including improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by a reduction in wafer starts. Imaging: Imaging sales for 2007 decreased 8% from 2006 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure. Declines in average selling prices were partially mitigated by increased sales of higher resolution products. Imaging sales were 12% of the Companys total net sales in 2007 as compared to 14% for 2006 and 6% for 2005. Imaging sales for 2006 increased by 147% from 2005 as unit sales tripled, partially offset by a 19% decrease in average selling price per unit. The decrease in average selling price per unit was due primarily to a significant increase of lower priced VGA products sold in 2006 as compared to 2005. The growth in Imaging unit sales for 2006 reflected strong demand for the Companys products and increased production. Gross Margin The Companys overall gross margin percentage for 2007 declined to 19% from 23% for 2006 due to a decrease in both the gross margin percentages for Memory and Imaging products. The Companys overall gross margin percentage of 23% for 2006 was unchanged from 2005 as a decrease in the gross margin percentage for Memory in 2006 to 19% from 22% for 2005 was offset by a slight increase in the gross margin percentage for Imaging products and a shift in product mix to higher margin Imaging products. Memory: The Companys gross margin percentage for Memory products of 17% for 2007 declined from 19% for 2006 primarily due to the shift in product mix to NAND Flash products, which had a significantly lower gross margin than DRAM products in 2007. This decline in gross margin percentage was mitigated by improvements in the gross margin for 2007 on sales of both DRAM and NAND Flash products as compared to 2006. 28 The gross margin for DRAM products for 2007 improved from 2006, primarily due to a 27% reduction in costs per megabit, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of 23%. The Company achieved cost reductions for DRAM products through transitions to production of devices utilizing the Companys advanced 78nm process technologies. The Companys gross margin on NAND Flash products for 2007 improved slightly from 2006 primarily due to a 57% reduction in costs per megabit, partially offset by a 56% decline in average selling prices. Cost reductions in 2007 reflect lower manufacturing costs, lower costs of NAND Flash products purchased for sale under the Companys Lexar brand and shifts in product mix. The Company achieved manufacturing cost reductions for NAND Flash products primarily through increased production of higher density, advanced geometry devices at the Companys 300mm fabrication facilities. Sales of NAND Flash products include sales from IM Flash to Intel at long term negotiated prices approximating cost. IM Flash sales to Intel were $255 million and $111 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys gross margin for memory in 2007 was adversely impacted by an inventory write down of $20 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products. The Company may record additional write downs in future periods if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of these products. The Companys gross margin percentage for Memory products declined to 19% for 2006 from 22% for 2005 primarily due to declining margins for NAND Flash products as a result of the 33% decrease in the average selling price per megabit and costs associated with the ramp in production at two facilities. The gross margin percentage for DRAM products in 2006 was approximately the same as for 2005 as a 22% decrease in the average selling price per megabit was offset by cost reductions. The Company achieved cost reductions for DRAM products in 2006 through improved product yields and an increase in production utilizing the Companys 110nm and 95nm process technologies. The cost per megabit for products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2006 compared to 2005 as the Company continued to increase 300mm wafer production. In 2007, the Companys TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (TECH) joint venture supplied approximately 15% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company (reflecting approximately 40% of total DRAM megabits). TECH primarily produced DDR and DDR2 products in 2007 and 2006. Since the beginning of the third quarter of 2006, TECHs results have been included in the Companys consolidated results. Through the second quarter of 2006, the Companys results reflected memory products purchased from TECH at prices generally based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the preceding quarter. In the first six months of 2006, the Company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products than on sales of similar products manufactured by the Companys wholly owned operations. Since TECH utilizes the Companys product designs and process technology and has a similar manufacturing cost structure, the gross margin on sales of TECH products since the third quarter of 2006 approximated those on sales of similar products manufactured by the Companys wholly owned operations. In 2005, the Companys gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products were approximately the same as on sales of similar products manufactured by the Companys wholly owned operations. (See
