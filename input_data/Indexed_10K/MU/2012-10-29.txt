Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview.")Business SegmentsWe have the following four reportable segments:NAND Solutions Group ("NSG"): Includes high volume NAND Flash products sold into data storage, personal musicplayers and the high density computing market, as well as NAND Flash products sold to Intel Corporation ("Intel") through IM Flash.DRAM Solutions Group ("DSG"): Includes DRAM products sold to the PC, consumer electronics, networking and server markets.Wireless Solutions Group ("WSG"): Includes DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash products, including multi chip packages, sold to the mobile device market.Embedded Solutions Group ("ESG"): Includes DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications, as well as NOR and NAND Flash sold to consumer electronics, networking, PC and server markets.Our other operations do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under All Other.ProductsNAND Flash MemoryNAND Flash products are electrically re writeable, non volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. NAND Flash sales were 44%, 36% and 30% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. NAND Flash products are sold by our NSG, WSG and ESG segments. NAND Flash is ideal for mass storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density and low cost per bit relative to other solid state memories. Removable storage devices, such as USB and Flash memory cards, are used with applications such as PCs, digital still cameras, MP3/4 players and mobile phones. Embedded NAND Flash based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, MP3/4 players, computers, solid state drives ("SSDs"), tablets and other personal and consumer applications. The market for NAND Flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other removable and embedded storage devices.Our NAND Flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. We offer Single Level Cell ("SLC") NAND Flash products as well as Multi Level Cell ("MLC") and Triple Level Cell ("TLC") NAND Flash products, which have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of SLC NAND Flash products. In 2012, we offered SLC NAND products in 1 gigabit ("Gb") to 64Gb densities. In addition, we offered 8Gb to 128Gb 2 bit per cell MLC NAND Flash products and 32Gb to 128Gb 3 bit per cell TLC NAND Flash products. We offer high speed NAND Flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces. Additionally, our multichip packages ("MCPs") incorporate NAND Flash with other memory products to create a single package that simplifies design while improving performance and functionality.2We offer next generation RealSSD SSDs for enterprise server and notebook applications which feature higher performance, reduced power consumption and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. Using our SLC and MLC NAND Flash process technology, these SSDs are offered in 2.5 inch and 1.8 inch form factors, with densities up to 512 gigabytes ("GB"). We also offer embedded USB devices with densities up to 16GB. We are sampling enterprise PCIe SSDs with capacities up to 700GB. We expect that demand for SSDs will continue to increase significantly over the next several years.Through our Lexar brand, we sell high performance digital media products and other flash based storage products through retail and OEM channels. Our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and JumpDrive products with a range of speeds, capacities and value added features. We offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including: CompactFlash, Memory Stick and Secure Digital ("SD"). CompactFlash and Memory Stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. Other products, including SD memory cards and some JumpDrive products, incorporate third party controllers. We also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other NAND Flash suppliers.Dynamic Random Access Memory ("DRAM")DRAM products are high density, low cost per bit, random access memory devices that provide high speed data storage and retrieval. DRAM sales products were 39%, 41% and 60% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. DRAM products are sold by our DSG, WSG and ESG segments. We offer DRAM products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics including high volume DDR3 and DDR2 products as well as specialty DRAM memory products including Mobile Low Power DRAM ("LPDRAM"), DDR, SDRAM, Reduced Latency DRAM ("RLDRAM") and Pseudo static DRAM ("PSRAM").DDR3 and DDR2: DDR3 and DDR2 are standardized, high density, high volume, DRAM products that are sold primarily for use as main system memory in computers and servers. DDR3 and DDR2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost. DDR3 sales were 20%, 21% and 22% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. DDR2 sales were 9%, 10% and 24% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect to begin volume production of DDR4 products in 2013.We offer DDR3 products in 1Gb, 2Gb and 4Gb densities and DDR2 products in 512 megabit ("Mb"), 1Gb and 2Gb densities. These densities enable us to meet customer demands for a broad array of products and we offer these products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types.Specialty DRAM products: We also offer DRAM memory products including DDR and DDR2 Mobile LPDRAM, DDR, SDRAM, RLDRAM and PSRAM in densities ranging from 64Mb to 4Gb. LPDRAM products are used primarily in laptop computers, tablets and other consumer devices that require low power consumption. Our other specialty DRAM products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and computer peripherals as well as computer memory upgrades. Aggregate sales of LPDRAM and our other specialty DRAM products were 10%, 10% and 14% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.NOR Flash MemoryNOR Flash products are electrically re writeable, non volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off, offer fast read times due to random access capability and have execute in place ("XiP") capability that enables processors to read NOR Flash without first accessing RAM. These capabilities make NOR ideal for storing program code in wireless and embedded applications. Our NOR Flash sales originated from the May 7, 2010 acquisition of Numonyx and were 12%, 18% and 5% of our total net sales for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. NOR Flash products are sold by our WSG and ESG segments.We offer both parallel and serial interface NOR Flash products in a broad range of densities, packages and features. Our parallel NOR Flash products are constructed to meet the needs of the consumer electronics, industrial, wired and wireless communications, computing and automotive applications. These products offer high densities, XiP performance, architectural flexibility and proven reliability in rigorous industrial settings. Our serial NOR Flash products are designed to meet the needs of consumer electronics, industrial, wired communications and computing applications. These products offer industry standard packaging, pinouts, command sets and chipset compatibility.3Partnering ArrangementsThe following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of August 30, 2012: Member or Partner(s)Approximate MicronOwnership InterestFormed/AcquiredProduct MarketConsolidated Entities IMFT(1) Intel Corporation51%2006NAND FlashMP Mask(2) Photronics, Inc.50%2006Photomasks Equity Method Investments Inotera(3) Nanya Technology Corporation40%2009DRAMAptina(4) Riverwood Capital LLC and TPG Partners VI, L.P.35%2009CMOS Image Sensors(1)IMFT: We partner with Intel for the design, development and manufacture of NAND Flash and certain emerging memory products.

Our results of operations for 2012 were impacted by the following key transactions and events. IM Flash Joint VenturesOn April 6, 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with Intel to restructure IM Flash. We acquired Intels remaining 18% interest in IMFS for $466 million. In addition, we acquired IMFTs assets located at our Virginia wafer fabrication facility, for which Intel received a distribution from IMFT of $139 million. For both transactions, the amounts Intel received approximated the book values of Intels interests in the assets acquired. Additionally, we received a $300 million deposit from Intel which will be applied to Intels future purchases of NAND Flash under a supply agreement or, under certain circumstances, refunded.The agreements also provided for the following:expansion of the scope of the IMFT joint venture to include certain emerging memory technologies;supply of NAND Flash memory products and certain emerging memory products to Intel on a cost plus basis and termination of IMFSs supply agreement with us and Intel;extension of IMFTs joint venture agreement through 2024;28certain buy sell rights, commencing in 2015, pursuant to which Intel may elect to sell to us, or we may elect to purchase from Intel, Intels interest in IMFT (if Intel so elects, we would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from Intel for one to two years);financing of $65 million provided by Intel to us under a two year senior unsecured promissory note, payable with interest in approximately equal quarterly installments; andtermination of IMFTs lease to use approximately 50% of our Virginia fabrication facility.We and Intel continue to share output of IMFT and certain research and development costs generally in proportion to our investments in IMFT, which was 51% Micron and 49% Intel as of August 30, 2012.Elpida Memory, Inc.Elpida Sponsor Agreement On July 2, 2012, we entered into a sponsor agreement (the "Sponsor Agreement") with the trustees of Elpida Memory, Inc. (Elpida) and Elpidas wholly owned subsidiary, Akita Elpida Memory, Inc. (Akita) (Elpida and Akita, collectively, the Elpida Companies). The Elpida Companies filed petitions for corporate reorganization proceedings with the Tokyo District Court under the Corporate Reorganization Act of Japan on February 27, 2012.Under the Sponsor Agreement, we committed to support plans of reorganization for the Elpida Companies that would provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of the Elpida Companies in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen (or approximately $2.5 billion), less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items. As a condition of the Sponsor Agreement, we deposited 1.8 billion yen (or approximately $23 million) into an escrow account which will be applied to the share acquisition payments at closing. Of the aggregate amount, we will fund 60 billion yen (or approximately $750 million) through a cash payment to Elpida at the closing, in exchange for 100% ownership of Elpidas equity. The remaining 140 billion yen (or approximately $1.75 billion) of payments will be made by the Elpida Companies (using cash flows expected to be generated from our payment for foundry services provided by Elpida, as our subsidiary) in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014, with payments of 20 billion yen (or approximately $250 million) in each of 2014 through 2017, and payments of 30 billion yen (or approximately $375 million) in each of 2018 and 2019.We have agreed to provide additional support to Elpida, which may include a payment guarantee under certain circumstances, to facilitate its continued access to debtor in possession financing of up to 16 billion yen (or approximately $200 million) from third party finance sources through the closing of the Elpida share purchase, and to use reasonable efforts to assist Elpida in obtaining up to 5 billion yen (or approximately $63 million) of continued debtor in possession financing from third parties for up to two months following the closing. In addition, we have agreed to use reasonable efforts to assist the Elpida Companies in financing up to 64 billion yen (or approximately $800 million) of capital expenditures through June 30, 2014, including up to 40 billion yen (or approximately $500 million) prior to June 30, 2013, either by providing a payment guarantee under certain circumstances, or by providing such financing directly.Under applicable Japanese law, following the closing of the transaction, because a portion of the payments to creditors will be satisfied through the installment payments described above, the operation of the businesses of the Elpida Companies will remain subject to the oversight of the court in charge of the reorganization proceedings and of the trustees (including a trustee nominated by us upon the closing of the transaction).The Sponsor Agreement contains certain termination rights, including our right to terminate the Sponsor Agreement if a change, taken together with all other changes, occurs that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to (i) the business, assets, etc. of Elpida and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the business, assets, etc. taken as a whole of Rexchip Electronics Corporation ("Rexchip"), a Taiwanese corporation formed as a manufacturing joint venture by Elpida and Powerchip Technology Corporation ("Powerchip"), a Taiwanese corporation; or (ii) our ability to operate Elpidas business immediately following closing in substantially the same manner as conducted by Elpida as of July 2, 2012. Elpida currently owns, directly and indirectly through a subsidiary, approximately 65% of Rexchips outstanding common stock.The trustees of the Elpida Companies submitted plans of reorganization to the court on August 21, 2012, which plans are subject to court and creditor approval under applicable Japanese law. The Sponsor Agreement provides that the plans of reorganization submitted by the trustees are to contain terms consistent with the provisions of the Sponsor Agreement.29Certain creditors of Elpida are challenging the proposed plan of reorganization submitted by the trustees and have proposed an alternative plan of reorganization. An examiner appointed by the court has reviewed both plans and is currently expected to make a recommendation to the court, on or about October 29, 2012, regarding whether to submit one or both plans of reorganization to creditors for approval.The consummation of the Sponsor Agreement is subject to various closing conditions, including but not limited to approval by the Tokyo District Court, requisite creditor approval, receipt of approvals in bankruptcy proceedings in other jurisdictions and receipt of regulatory approvals, including the Peoples Republic of China. The transaction is currently anticipated to close in the first half of calendar 2013.Rexchip Share Purchase AgreementOn July 2, 2012, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Powerchip and certain of its affiliates (the "Rexchip Share Purchase Agreement"), under which we agreed to purchase approximately 714 million shares of Rexchip common stock, which represents approximately 24% of Rexchips outstanding common stock, for approximately 10 billion New Taiwan dollars (or approximately $334 million). The consummation of this Rexchip Share Purchase Agreement is subject to various closing conditions, including the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Elpida Sponsor Agreement. At the closing of the Elpida Sponsor Agreement and the Rexchip share purchase agreement, our aggregate beneficial ownership interest in Rexchip will approximate 89%.Currency HedgingElpida Hedges: On July 2, 2012, we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 200 billion yen with a weighted average strike price of 79.15 (yen per U.S. dollar). In addition, to reduce the cost of these call options, we sold put options to sell 100 billion yen with a strike price of 83.32 and we sold call options to buy 100 billion yen with a strike price of 75.57. The net cost of these call and put options, which expire on April 3, 2013, of $49 million is payable upon settlement. These currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening yen for our yen denominated payments under the sponsor agreement while preserving some ability for us to benefit if the value of the yen weakens relative to the U.S. dollar. These option contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and are remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses reflected in our results of operations.Rexchip Hedges: On July 25, 2012, we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 10 billion New Taiwan dollars with a weighted average strike price of 29.21 (New Taiwan dollar per U.S. dollar). The cost of these options, which expire on April 2, 2013, of $3 million is payable upon settlement. These currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening New Taiwan dollar for our payments under the Rexchip share purchase agreement. These option contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and are remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses reflected in our results of operations.30Results of OperationsConsolidated ResultsFor the year ended 2012 2011 2010Net sales $8,234 100 % $8,788 100 % $8,482 100 %Cost of goods sold 7,266 88 % 7,030 80 % 5,768 68 %Gross margin 968 12 % 1,758 20 % 2,714 32 % SG&A 620 8 % 592 7 % 528 6 %R&D 918 11 % 791 9 % 624 7 %Other operating (income) expense, net 48 1 % (380) (4)% (27) %Operating income (loss) (618) (8)% 755 9 % 1,589 19 % Interest income (expense), net (171) (2)% (101) (1)% (160) (2)%Gain on acquisition of Numonyx % % 437 5 %Other non operating income (expense), net 35 % (103) (1)% 54 1 %Income tax (provision) benefit 17 % (203) (2)% 19 %Equity in net loss of equity method investees (294) (4)% (158) (2)% (39) %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1) % (23) % (50) (1)%Net income (loss) attributable to Micron $(1,032) (13)% $167 2 % $1,850 22 %Our net income (loss) attributable to Micron shareholders for 2012 declined from 2011 primarily due to significant decreases in average selling prices for our principal products. Market selling prices for NAND Flash products declined for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to large increases in supply from improvements in product and process technologies as well as expansions in production capacity which outpaced relatively healthy growth in demand. Market selling prices for DRAM products declined for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to relatively low demand growth, particularly for high volume DDR3 DRAM, as a result of weakness in the personal computer market. Our improvements in product and process technologies in 2012 enabled significant increases in sales volumes that mitigated reductions in net sales from price declines. Our improvements in product and process technologies and our cost structure in 2012 produced cost reductions for NAND Flash products sold to trade customers and for DRAM products, partially offsetting the impact of the declines in average selling prices on our operating margins. In 2011, we recognized gains of $275 million from a 10 year patent cross license agreement with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ("Samsung").Net SalesFor the year ended 2012 2011 2010NSG $2,853 35% $2,196 25% $2,113 25%DSG 2,691 33% 3,203 36% 4,638 55%WSG 1,184 14% 1,959 22% 778 9%ESG 1,054 13% 1,002 11% 521 6%All Other 452 5% 428 6% 432 5% $8,234 100% $8,788 100% $8,482 100%Total net sales decreased 6% for 2012 as compared to 2011, reflecting declines in average selling prices across all reportable segments partially offset by increases in sales volumes. WSG sales decreased for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and in NOR Flash sales volumes, as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular, as well as a continued transition by customers from NOR Flash to NAND Flash. DSG sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by increases in sales volumes. NSG and ESG sales increased due to increases in sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices.31Total net sales for 2011 increased 4% as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in WSG and ESG sales as a result of the acquisition of Numonyx in May 2010. DSG sales for 2011 decreased 31% as compared to 2010 primarily due to declines in average selling prices mitigated by increases in gigabit sales. NSG sales for 2011 increased 4% as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in gigabit sales partially offset by declines in average selling prices.Gross MarginOur overall gross margin percentage declined from 20% for 2011 to 12% for 2012 primarily due to decreases in the gross margin percentage for DSG and WSG as a result of significant declines in average selling prices. Cost reductions from improvements in product and process technologies in 2012 mitigated the effect of significant declines in average selling prices for all reportable operating segments. Costs of our underutilized capacity, primarily associated with decreased production in our NOR Flash fabrication facilities and the ramp of our IMFS NAND Flash fabrication facility, were $141 million, $133 million and $98 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Our overall gross margin percentage declined from 32% for 2010 to 20% for 2011 primarily due to a significant decline in the gross margin for DSG as a result of the dramatic decreases in average selling prices mitigated by a reduction in costs per gigabit. Declines in the gross margins of NSG, WSG and ESG, primarily due to decreases in average selling prices, also contributed to the overall decline in gross margin for 2011 as compared to 2010. The impact of declines in average selling prices for 2011 was partially offset by cost reductions.Operating Results by Business SegmentsNAND Solutions Group ("NSG")For the year ended 2012 2011 2010Net sales $2,853 $2,196 $2,113Operating income 198 269 240NSG sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of NAND Flash products. (See "Operating Results by Product NAND Flash" for further detail.) NSG sales for 2012 increased 30% from 2011 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Increases in gigabits sold for 2012 were primarily due to the continued ramp of our new wafer fabrication facility in Singapore and from improvements in product and process technologies. NSG sells a portion of its products to Intel through IM Flash at long term negotiated prices approximating cost. All other NSG products are sold to OEMs, resellers, retailers and other customers (including Intel), which we collectively refer to as "trade customers."NSG sales of NAND Flash products to trade customers increased 50% for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. NSG operating income declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions. Cost reductions resulted primarily from improvements in product and process technologies. NSG operating income for 2011 benefited from a $57 million gain from an allocated portion of the Samsung patent cross license agreement.NSG sales of NAND Flash products to trade customers for 2011 decreased 2% from 2010 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. NSG operating income for 2011 benefited from cost reductions and the $57 million gain from the license agreement with Samsung, which were partially offset by the declines in average selling prices.The ramp of production at our new wafer fabrication facility in Singapore significantly increased our NAND Flash production in 2012 and 2011. Due to the completion of the first phase of the ramp, we expect slower growth in our NAND Flash production for 2013. Initially the new wafer fabrication facility in Singapore was operated under our IMFS joint venture with Intel and our share of the operating costs and supply of NAND Flash from IMFS was adjusted for changes in our ownership share in IMFS. Our share of IMFS output grew from 51% in the first quarter of 2011 to 78% in the second quarter of 2012. On April 6, 2012, we acquired Intels remaining ownership interest in IMFS and the assets of IMFT located at our Virginia fabrication facility and terminated the IMFS supply agreement. Accordingly, we now obtain all of the NAND Flash output from our Singapore and Virginia wafer fabrication facilities.32On April 6, 2012, we also entered into a new supply agreement with Intel under which Intel purchases NAND Flash products from us on a cost plus basis. Margins on products sold to Intel on a cost plus basis were not significantly different than margins on sales for other trade customers for 2012. Aggregate NSG sales to Intel (including sales by IMFT at prices approximating cost and sales by us under the new cost plus supply agreement) were $986 million for 2012, $884 million for 2011 and $764 million for 2010.DRAM Solutions Group ("DSG")For the year ended 2012 2011 2010Net sales $2,691 $3,203 $4,638Operating income (loss) (500) 290 1,269DSG sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of DRAM products. (See "Operating Results by Product DRAM" for further detail.) DSG sales for 2012 decreased 16% as compared to 2011 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. DSGs operating margin declined from 2011 to 2012 due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions as a result of improved product and process technologies. DSG sales and operating margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by a $58 million charge for a settlement with a customer. In addition, DSG operating income for 2011 benefited from a $75 million gain from an allocated portion of the Samsung patent cross license agreement.The significant declines in DSG sales and margins for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a severe decrease in demand for PC DRAM, particularly for DDR3 DRAM, due to overall weakness in the PC market. Decreases in PC DRAM margins for 2011 were mitigated by the relatively higher margins in our server and other premium markets.DSG operating income for 2011 benefited from the following items as compared to the corresponding periods of 2010:lower SG&A costs primarily due to costs recognized in the third quarter of 2010 from the settlement of litigation in DRAM antitrust matters;lower R&D costs primarily due to the DRAM R&D cost sharing agreement with Nanya that commenced in the third quarter of 2010; and the $75 million gain in 2011 from a license arrangement with Samsung.Wireless Solutions Group ("WSG")For the year ended 2012 2011 2010Net sales $1,184 $1,959 $778Operating income (loss) (370) 20 (23)In 2012, WSG sales were comprised of NOR Flash, NAND Flash and DRAM in decreasing order of revenue. The 40% decrease in WSG sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to declines in sales of wireless NOR Flash products as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular, as well as a continued transition by customers to NAND Flash. WSG sales in 2012 were also adversely impacted by lower sales of NAND Flash products sold in multi chip packages. The decline in WSG operating margin for 2012 was primarily due to the reductions in average selling prices and in NOR Flash sales volumes. In addition, WSG operating margin for 2011 benefited from a $95 million gain from an allocated portion of the Samsung patent cross license agreement.The 152% increase in WSG sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of Numonyx in May 2010. WSG experienced pricing pressure in 2011 due to weakness in demand from certain customers. During 2011 and 2010, a portion of the NAND Flash sold by WSG was obtained from Hynix at market prices and by the end of 2011, substantially all of this supply was obtained from lower cost Micron production. The improvement in WSG operating margin for 2011 was primarily due to the $95 million gain from the license agreement with Samsung.33Embedded Solutions Group ("ESG")For the year ended 2012 2011 2010Net sales $1,054 $1,002 $521Operating income 156 237 152In 2012, ESG sales were comprised of NOR Flash, DRAM and NAND Flash in decreasing order of revenue. The 5% increase in ESG sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased sales volume of DRAM, NAND Flash and NOR Flash products as ESG continued to expand its customer base, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. ESG operating income for 2012 declined as compared to 2011 due to decreases in average selling prices and higher costs associated with underutilized capacity in our NOR Flash facilities. In addition, ESG operating margin for 2011 benefited from a $33 million gain from an allocated portion of the Samsung patent cross license agreement.The 92% increase in ESG sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of Numonyx in May 2010. Absent impacts from the Numonyx acquisition, ESGs performance in the automotive, industrial and networking markets was relatively stable from 2010 to 2011. In addition, during 2011 and 2010, a portion of the NAND Flash sold by ESG was obtained from Hynix at market prices and by the end of 2011, the majority of this supply was obtained from lower cost Micron production. The increase in ESGs operating income for 2011 is primarily due to the acquisition of Numonyx. In addition, ESG operating income for 2011 benefited from the $33 million gain from the license agreement with Samsung.Operating Results by Product Net Sales by ProductFor the year ended 2012 2011 2010NAND Flash $3,627 44% $3,193 36% $2,555 30%DRAM 3,178 39% 3,620 41% 5,052 60%NOR Flash 977 12% 1,547 18% 451 5%Other 452 5% 428 5% 424 5% $8,234 100% $8,788 100% $8,482 100%NAND FlashWe sell a portion of our output of NAND Flash products to Intel through IM Flash at long term negotiated prices approximating cost. (See "Operating Results by Business Segments NAND Solutions Group" for further detail.) We sell the remainder of our NAND Flash products to trade customers.For the year ended 2012 2011 (percentage change from prior period)Sales to trade customers: Net sales 19 % 31 %Average selling prices per gigabit (55)% (12)%Gigabits sold 164 % 50 %Cost per gigabit (54)% 2 %Increases in NAND Flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the ramp of the IMFS fabrication facility and improved product and process technologies. The new cost plus supply agreement with Intel also contributed to the increase in gigabits sold to trade customers for 2012. The gross margin percentage on sales of NAND Flash products to trade customers declined slightly from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions. 34DRAMFor the year ended 2012 2011 (percentage change from prior period)Net sales (12)% (28)%Average selling prices per gigabit (45)% (39)%Gigabits sold 59 % 19 %Cost per gigabit (32)% (23)%The increase in gigabit sales of DRAM products for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased output obtained from our Inotera joint venture, the effects of a shift in mix to higher density products and improved product and process technologies. The gross margin percentage on sales of DRAM products declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions. DRAM sales and gross margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by the effects of the $58 million charge to revenue in 2012 for a settlement with a customer. We have the right and obligation to purchase 50% of Inoteras wafer production capacity under the Inotera Supply Agreement. As a result of our March 7, 2012 equity contribution to Inotera, we expect to receive a higher share of Inoteras 30 nanometer output when it becomes available as a result of Inotera capital investments enabled by this investment. DRAM products acquired from Inotera accounted for 46% of our DRAM gigabit production for 2012 as compared to 33% for 2011 and 23% for 2010. The higher level of production from Inotera was achieved through Inoteras continued transition to advanced product and process technologies. We primarily obtained DDR3 DRAM products for the PC market from Inotera in 2012 and 2011. Our cost of wafers purchased under the Inotera Supply Agreement is based on a margin sharing formula among Nanya, Inotera and us. Under such formula, all parties manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by Inotera, as well as our and Nanyas revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by Inotera, are considered in determining costs for wafers acquired from Inotera. Our cost of products purchased under the Inotera Supply Agreement in 2012 were lower than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly owned facilities.Due to significant market declines in the selling prices of DRAM, Inotera incurred net losses of $259 million for its six month period ended June 30, 2012 and $737 million for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the Republic of China, Inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended September 30, 2012 of an additional New Taiwan dollars 4,390 million (approximately $150 million U.S. dollars). In addition, Inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $1.85 billion as of June 30, 2012, which exposes Inotera to liquidity risk. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, Inotera was also not in compliance with certain loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years, which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year. Inotera obtained a waiver from complying with its financial covenants through June 30, 2012 and has requested an additional waiver from these requirements. Inoteras management has developed plans to improve its liquidity. There can be no assurance that Inotera will be successful in obtaining an additional waiver or improving its liquidity.NOR FlashSales of NOR Flash products for 2012 declined from 2011 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless NOR Flashproducts, as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications toNAND Flash products that led to significant declines in average selling prices and sales volume. Our gross margin percentage on sales of NOR Flash products declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices, inventory write downs and costs of underutilized capacity.Sales of NOR Flash products increased for 2011as compared to 2010 primarily due to our acquisition of Numonyx in May 2010 as all of our sales of NOR Flash originated from this acquisition. Our gross margin percentage on sales of NOR Flash products for 2011 improved slightly as compared to 2010 primarily due to cost reductions.35Operating Expenses and Other Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for 2012 increased 5% as compared to 2011 primarily due to a $13 million contribution to a university program and stock based compensation and other amounts related to the death benefits of our former Chief Executive Officer in 2012.SG&A expenses for 2011 increased 12% as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased costs associated with Numonyx operations and higher payroll costs, partially offset by a reduction in legal costs. The reduction in legal costs from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to $64 million of costs in 2010 for settlements of an indirect purchasers antitrust case and other matters. We expect that SG&A expenses will approximate $135 million to $145 million for the first quarter of 2013.Research and DevelopmentR&D expenses for 2012 increased 16% from 2011 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed, higher personnel costs associated with increased salary and wage rates and additional headcount for our expanded R&D operations, and higher software and materials costs.R&D expenses for 2011 increased 27% from 2010 primarily due to increased costs associated with R&D activities for acquired Numonyx operations, higher payroll costs, and a higher volume of pre qualification wafers processed.As a result of amounts reimbursable from Nanya under a DRAM R&D cost sharing arrangement, R&D expenses were reduced by $138 million, $141 million and $51 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The April 6, 2012 agreements with Intel expanded our NAND Flash R&D cost sharing agreement to include certain emerging memory technologies, but did not change the cost sharing percentage. As a result of amounts reimbursable from Intel, R&D expenses were reduced by $87 million, $95 million and $104 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect that R&D expenses, net of amounts reimbursable from our R&D partners, will be approximately $220 million to $230 million for the first quarter of 2013.Our process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line width process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. Product design and development efforts include our high density DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM and Mobile Low Power DDR DRAM products as well as high density and mobile NAND Flash memory (including multi level and triple level cell technologies), NOR Flash memory, specialty memory, phase change memory, solid state drives and other memory technologies and systems.Interest Income (Expense)Interest expense for 2012, 2011 and 2010, included aggregate amounts of non cash amortization of debt discount and other costs of $83 million, $60 million and $76 million, respectively. Interest expense for 2012 also included $9 million of "make whole premium" paid to holders of our 2013 Notes. (See "
