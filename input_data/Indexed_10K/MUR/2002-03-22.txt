Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The Company reported record net income in 2001 of $330.9 million, $7.26 a diluted share, compared to net income in 2000 of $296.8 million, $6.56 a diluted share. In 1999, the Company earned $119.7 million, $2.66 a diluted share. Net income for the three years ended December 31, 2001 included certain special items that resulted in a net benefit of $67.6 million, $1.48 a diluted share, in 2001; a net charge of $7.2 million, $.16 a diluted share, in 2000; and a net benefit of $19.7 million, $.44 a diluted share, in 1999. The special items in 2001 included an after tax benefit of $71 million, $1.56 a diluted share, from the sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking assets; and a benefit of $8.9 million, $.19 a diluted share, from settlement of income tax matters and a reduction of a provincial tax rate in Canada. Other special items that decreased earnings in 2001 included an after tax charge of $6.8 million, $.15 a diluted share, for asset impairments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121; and a charge of $5.5 million, $.12 a diluted share, relating to resolution of Clean Air Act violations at the Companys Superior, Wisconsin refinery. The special items in 2000 included a benefit from settlement of income tax matters for $25.6 million, $.56 a share, and a gain on sale of assets of $1.5 million, $.03 a share. Unusual items that decreased earnings in 2000 included an after tax charge of $17.8 million, $.39 a diluted share, from asset impairments; a charge of $7.8 million, $.17 a share, for transportation and other disputed contractual items under the Companys concessions in Ecuador; and an after tax charge of $8.7 million, $.19 a share, for a change in accounting for the Companys unsold crude oil production. The 1999 special items included after tax gains of $7.5 million, $.17 a diluted share, from sale of assets; and $12.2 million, $.27 a diluted share, primarily from settlements of income taxes and other matters. 2001 vs. 2000 Excluding special items, income in 2001 totaled $263.3 million, $5.78 a diluted share, which was $40.7 million lower than the $304 million, $6.72 a diluted share, earned in 2000. The decline primarily arose from a decrease of $90.2 million in earnings from exploration and production operations caused by an 18% reduction in realized oil prices during 2001 and higher exploration expenses. The Companys North American natural gas sales price declined 1% during 2001 to a realized price of $3.87 per MCF. Production of oil and natural gas were at record levels during 2001, increasing by 3% and 23%, respectively, compared to 2000. Refining and marketing operations produced record earnings during 2001 as income before special items increased by 63% to $89 million. Stronger unit margins in the U.S. during the first half of the year caused the improved results. The costs of corporate activities, which include interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $13.8 million in 2001, excluding special items, compared to $28.8 million in 2000. The $15 million reduction in 2001 was primarily due to higher income tax benefits in the current year. 2000 vs. 1999 Income before special items in 2000 was a Company record $304 million, $6.72 a diluted share. The results for 2000 represented a $204 million improvement compared to income before special items of $100 million, $2.22 a diluted share, in 1999. The improvement primarily arose from record earnings from the Companys exploration and production operations, which amounted to $278.3 million in 2000 compared to $121.2 million in 1999. Higher sales prices for both crude oil and natural gas were the principal reasons behind the higher exploration and production earnings. The Companys average worldwide sales price for crude oil and condensate was $25.96 per barrel in 2000 and $17.08 per barrel in 1999. The average sales price of North American natural gas improved from $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 1999 to $3.90 in 2000. Earnings from refining and marketing operations increased from $14.9 million in 1999 to $54.5 million in 2000. These results improved due to better unit margins in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The costs of corporate activities were $28.8 million in 2000, excluding special items, compared to $36.1 million in 1999. The reduction in 2000 was primarily due to lower net interest costs and lower compensation expense for awards under the Companys stock based incentive plans. 8 In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2001 are presented by segment. Special items, which can obscure underlying trends of operating results and affect comparability between years, are set out separately. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 Exploration and production United States $ 63.6 63.9 30.3 Canada 79.7 112.3 47.0 United Kingdom 76.7 90.2 37.2 Ecuador 11.5 28.9 14.4 Malaysia (36.1) (10.7) (1.7) Other (7.3) (6.3) (6.0) 188.1 278.3 121.2 Refining and marketing United States 71.1 23.9 (5.9) United Kingdom 14.1 23.0 14.0 Canada 3.8 7.6 6.8 89.0 54.5 14.9 Corporate and other (13.8) (28.8) (36.1) Income before special items and cumulative effect of accounting change 263.3 304.0 100.0 Gain on sale of assets 71.0 1.5 7.5 Income tax settlements and tax rate change 8.9 25.6 5.0 Impairment of properties (6.8) (17.8) Provision for environmental matter (5.5) Gain (loss) on transportation and other disputed contractual items in Ecuador (7.8) 8.2 Provision for reduction in force (1.0) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 330.9 305.5 119.7 Cumulative effect of accounting change (8.7) Net income $330.9 296.8 119.7 Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production operations before special items were $188.1 million in 2001, compared to earnings of $278.3 million in 2000 and $121.2 million in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily attributable to an 18% decline in the Companys average oil sales price compared to 2000. Additionally, exploration expenses increased over 2000, a significant portion of which were in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has no realized income tax benefits. Production of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids increased from 65,259 barrels per day in 2000 to 67,355 in 2001, a 3% increase. Natural gas sales volumes totaled 281.2 million cubic feet per day in 2001, up 23% from 229.4 million in 2000. The improvement in 2000 earnings compared to 1999 was primarily due to increases in the Companys crude oil sales prices and higher sales prices for its North American natural gas production. Production of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids decreased 1% in 2000, and natural gas sales volumes fell 5% as declines in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico more than offset higher oil and gas sales volumes in Canada. Higher exploration expenses in 2000 compared to 1999 partially offset the effects of higher commodity prices. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating area on pages F 31 and F 32 of this Form 10 K report. Daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 9 of the 2001 Annual Report. 9 A summary of oil and gas revenues, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 United States Crude oil $ 51.9 72.4 54.4 Natural gas 192.8 211.4 147.6 Canada Crude oil 167.2 193.9 107.7 Natural gas 182.6 99.0 40.2 Synthetic oil 95.8 91.5 74.8 United Kingdom Crude oil 181.5 214.6 134.7 Natural gas 12.1 7.8 7.7 Ecuador crude oil 33.4 52.2 36.1 Total oil and gas revenues $917.3 942.8 603.2 The Companys crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production averaged 67,355 barrels per day in 2001, 65,259 in 2000 and 66,083 in 1999. Sales volumes in 2001 were slightly higher and averaged 67,884 barrels per day. Oil production in the United States declined 14% in 2001, following a 21% decline in 2000. The reduction in both years was primarily due to declines from existing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil production in Canada increased 15% in 2001 to a record volume of 36,059 barrels per day. The Companys share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved 2,036 barrels per day, or 24%, in 2001 due to a combination of higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by increased capital spending and a lower oil price. Before royalties, the Companys synthetic oil production was 11,157 barrels per day in 2001, 10,145 in 2000 and 11,146 in 1999. Production of light oil increased 1,258 barrels per day, or 41%, and heavy oil production increased 11% to 11,707 barrels per day in 2001 with both increases primarily due to the Companys acquisition of Beau Canada Exploration Ltd. (Beau Canada) in November 2000. Production at Hibernia rose 4% in 2001 to 9,535 barrels per day due to better operating efficiency, primarily associated with improved handling of gas production. U.K. production was down by 681 barrels per day, or 3%, due to declines from the Companys existing fields in the North Sea. In 2000, oil production increased 4% in Canada. Production at Hibernia rose 2,795 barrels per day due to improved operations. Heavy oil production in western Canada was 1,475 barrels per day higher in 2000 due primarily to an active drilling program in the early part of the year. The Companys share of net production at its synthetic oil operation in Canada was down 2,554 barrels per day in 2000 due to a combination of more downtime for maintenance and a higher net profit royalty caused by higher prices. Production of light oil in Canada decreased 400 barrels per day in 2000. U.K. production increased 357 barrels per day in 2000 as improved volumes at Mungo/Monan and Schiehallion were almost offset by declines at more mature fields in the North Sea. Production in Ecuador was down 699 barrels per day in 2000 due to pipeline constraints. Worldwide sales of natural gas were a record 281.2 million cubic feet per day in 2001, up from 229.4 million in 2000. Natural gas sales were 240.4 million cubic feet per day in 1999. Sales of natural gas in the United States were 115.5 million cubic feet per day in 2001, 144.8 million in 2000 and 171.8 million in 1999. The reductions in 2001 and 2000 were due to lower deliverability from maturing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas sales in Canada in 2001 were at record levels for the sixth consecutive year as sales increased 107% to 152.6 million cubic feet per day. Canadian natural gas sales had increased 31% in 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the acquisition of Beau Canada; production in both 2001 and 2000 benefited from new discoveries in western Canada. Natural gas sales in the United Kingdom were 13.1 million cubic feet per day in 2001, up 21% compared to 2000. U.K. natural gas sales in 2000 decreased 1.6 million cubic feet per day from 1999 levels. Worldwide crude oil sales prices declined during 2001 compared to 2000. In the United States, the Companys average monthly sale price for crude oil and condensate declined 18% compared to 2000 and averaged $24.92 per barrel for the year. In Canada, the average sales price for light oil fell 19% to $22.40 per barrel. Heavy oil prices averaged $11.06 per barrel, down 38% from 2000. The average sales price for crude oil from the Hibernia field decreased 12% to $23.77 per barrel. Synthetic oil prices in 2001 averaged $25.04 per barrel, down 15% from a year ago. Average sales prices in the U.K. averaged $24.44 per barrel, a decline of 12%, and sales prices in Ecuador were down 23% to $17.00 per barrel. 10 Worldwide crude oil sales prices in 2000 were significantly higher than in 1999. In the United States, Murphys 2000 average sales prices for crude oil and condensate averaged $30.38 per barrel for the year, 68% above 1999. In Canada, the average sales price for light oil was $27.68 per barrel in 2000, an increase of 63%. Heavy oil prices averaged $17.83 per barrel, up 40% compared to 1999. The average sales price for synthetic oil in 2000 was $29.62 per barrel, up 59%. The sales price for crude oil from the Hibernia field increased 42% to $27.16 per barrel. U.K. sales prices averaged 54% higher in 2000 at $27.78 per barrel. Sales prices in Ecuador were $22.01 per barrel in 2000, up 53% from a year earlier. The Companys North American natural gas sales price averaged $3.87 per MCF for the year 2001 compared to $3.90 in 2000. U.S. sales prices averaged $4.64 per MCF compared to $4.01 a year ago. However, the average price for natural gas sold in Canada declined 11% to $3.28 per MCF. Prices in the United Kingdom increased to $2.52 per MCF from $1.81 in 2000. North American natural gas sales prices strengthened during 2000 due to supply being short of demand. A combination of a hotter than normal summer and a colder than normal early winter near the end of 2000 in the United States strained an already below normal level of gas storage throughout the country. Natural gas sales prices in the United States increased 71% from 1999 and averaged $4.01 per MCF in 2000 compared to $2.34 in the prior year. The average price for natural gas sold in Canada during 2000 increased 87% to $3.67 per MCF, while prices in the United Kingdom increased 8% to $1.81. Based on 2001 volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1 per barrel and $.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by $16.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses were $218 million in 2001, $181.9 million in 2000 and $162.1 million in 1999. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 31 and F 32 of this Form 10 K report. Cost per equivalent barrel during the last three years were as follows. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2001 2000 1999 United States $ 5.30 3.72 2.98 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 3.84 4.24 3.99 Synthetic oil 13.58 13.06 9.09 United Kingdom 3.75 3.46 3.73 Ecuador 7.60 6.65 5.10 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 4.36 4.05 3.62 The increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the United States in both 2001 and 2000 was attributable to a combination of lower production and higher well servicing costs. The decrease in Canada during 2001, excluding synthetic oil, was primarily due to increased production in all categories. The increase in the cost per equivalent barrel for Canadian synthetic oil in 2001 was due to higher maintenance costs. The increase in unit cost in the United Kingdom during 2001 was the result of higher costs to maintain mature properties, including Ninian, and the increase in Ecuador in 2001 was due to lower production during the year. The 2000 increase in Canada, excluding synthetic oil, was due to an increase in well servicing costs at heavy oil properties offset in part by the effect of higher production at Hibernia, where production expenses are lower than in western Canada. The increase for Canadian synthetic oil in 2000 was due to lower net production caused by a combination of less gross production volumes and an increase in royalty barrels caused by higher oil prices. Based on the Companys interest in Syncrudes gross production, cost per barrel increased 21% in 2000. A lower unit cost in the United Kingdom in 2000 was due to a favorable impact from higher production at the Mungo/Monan and Schiehallion fields. Higher cost per barrel in Ecuador in 2000 was attributable to both lower production and higher overall operating expenses. 11 Exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 31 and F 32 of this Form 10 K report. Certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditure totals for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 Exploratory expenditures charged against income Dry hole costs $ 82.8 66.0 32.4 Geological and geophysical costs 36.0 36.3 18.7 Other costs 15.0 9.2 8.5 133.8 111.5 59.6 Undeveloped lease amortization 23.1 14.1 11.0 Total exploration expenses $156.9 125.6 70.6 Depreciation, depletion and amortization related to exploration and production operations totaled $183.7 million in 2001, $169.2 million in 2000 and $166.9 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was due to record levels of oil and natural gas sales during the year. The increase in 2000 was due to higher production from Hibernia field, offshore eastern Canada, and higher depreciation rates per unit on production from properties acquired from Beau Canada in November 2000. Refining and Marketing Earnings before special items from refining and marketing operations were a record $89 million in 2001. Comparable earnings in 2000 and 1999 were $54.5 million and $14.9 million, respectively. Operations in the United States earned $71.1 million in 2001 compared to $23.9 million in 2000, due to stronger refining margins and a higher percentage of sales through the Companys retail stations at Wal Mart stores. U.S. operations lost $5.9 million in 1999. The increase in 2000 was due to product sales realizations increasing more than the cost of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks. Operations in the United Kingdom earned $14.1 million in 2001, $23 million in 2000 and $14 million in 1999. The decline in 2001 earnings was caused by generally weaker U.K. refining margins compared to 2000. Strong refining margins in the United Kingdom in 2000 led to record earnings for this operation. The Company earned $3.8 million in 2001 from its crude oil trading and transportation business in Canada prior to the sale of these pipeline and trucking assets in May 2001. The Canadian operations earned $7.6 million and $6.8 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Unit margins (sales realizations less costs of crude oil, other feedstocks, refining and transportation to point of sale) averaged $3.23 per barrel in the United States in 2001, $1.91 in 2000 and $.66 in 1999. U.S. product sales increased 17% to a record 174,256 barrels per day in 2001, following an 18% increase in 2000. Higher product sales volumes in 2001 and 2000 were attributable to a combination of higher crude oil throughputs compared to the previous year at the Companys U.S. refineries, plus continued expansion of the Companys retail gasoline network at Wal Mart stores. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $3.29 per barrel in 2001, $4.69 in 2000 and $3.38 in 1999. Sales of petroleum products were up 4% in 2001 due to higher volumes sold in the cargo market. Sales volumes in 2000 were down 7% compared to 1999, with the decline attributable to lower consumer demand in the United Kingdom caused by the large increase in product prices during the year. Both U.S. and U.K. unit margins have been significantly weaker in early 2002, and both operations were experiencing losses during the early part of the year. Based on sales volumes for 2001 and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $.42 per barrel ($.01 per gallon) fluctuation in unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by $19.9 million. The effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the Companys exploration and production segments could be affected differently. Special Items Net income for the last three years included certain special items reviewed in the following paragraphs. The effects of special items on quarterly results for 2001 and 2000 are presented on page F 34 of this Form 10 K report. . Gain on sale of assets After tax gains of $67.6 million and $3.4 million were recorded in the second and fourth quarter, respectively, of 2001 for the sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking assets. After tax gains of $1.5 million were recorded in the second quarter of 2000 from the sale of U.S. corporate assets, and $6.3 million and $1.2 million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, of 1999 from the sale of U.S. service stations. 12 . Income tax settlements and tax rate change Income of $5.5 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2001 from a reduction in a Canadian provincial tax rate. In addition, settlement of income tax matters in the U.S. and U.K. provided income of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Income of $15.5 million, $10.1 million and $5 million from settlement of U.S. income tax matters was recorded in the third quarter of 2000, the fourth quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 1999, respectively. . Impairment of properties After tax provisions of $6.8 million, $13.6 million and $4.2 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, the third quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2000, respectively, for the write down of assets determined to be impaired. (See Note D to the consolidated financial statements.) . Provision for U.S. environmental matters A $5.5 million charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2001 to resolve Clean Air Act violations at the Companys Superior, Wisconsin refinery. . Gain (loss) on transportation and other disputed contractual items in Ecuador A loss of $7.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 and a gain of $8.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999 related to transportation and other contractual disputes under the Companys concessions in Ecuador. . Provision for reduction in force An after tax charge of $1 million for a reduction in force program was recorded in the first quarter of 1999. (See Note G to the consolidated financial statements.) . Cumulative effect of accounting change An after tax charge of $8.7 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2000 to account for the Companys unsold crude oil production at cost rather than at market value as in the past. (See Note B to the consolidated financial statements.) The income (loss) effects of special items for each of the three years ended December 31, 2001 are summarized by segment in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 Exploration and production United States $ (5.8) (13.6) 5.0 Canada 5.8 (4.2) United Kingdom 1.9 Ecuador (7.8) 8.2 1.9 (25.6) 13.2 Refining and marketing United States (6.5) 7.5 Canada 71.1 64.6 7.5 Corporate and other 1.1 27.1 (1.0) Cumulative effect of accounting change (8.7) Total income (loss) from special items $ 67.6 (7.2) 19.7 Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial information on page 7 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures, including discretionary exploration expenditures, were $864.4 million in 2001 compared to $557.9 million in 2000 and $386.6 million in 1999. These amounts included $133.8 million, $111.5 million and $59.6 million of exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled $683.5 million in 2001, 79% of the Companys total capital expenditures for the year. Exploration and production capital expenditures in 2001 included $65.2 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, $21.6 million for acquisition of proved oil and gas properties, $242.2 million for exploration activities, and $354.5 million for development projects. Development expenditures included $60.6 million for the Terra Nova oil field, offshore Newfoundland; $27.2 million for synthetic oil operations at Syncrude in Canada; and $96.3 million for heavy oil and natural gas projects in western Canada. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 30 of this Form 10 K report. 13 Refining and marketing expenditures, detailed in the following table, were 20% of total capital expenditures in 2001. (Millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 Refining United States $ 87.8 19.2 17.7 United Kingdom 1.1 4.3 7.0 Total refining 88.9 23.5 24.7 Marketing United States 75.0 92.8 58.7 United Kingdom 11.3 8.1 4.4 Total marketing 86.3 100.9 63.1 Other Canada 29.4 .3 Total $175.2 153.8 88.1 U.S. refining expenditures in 2001 included $55.1 million for clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the Meraux refinery. U.S. refining expenditures in 2000 and 1999 and U.K. expenditures during the three years were primarily for capital projects to keep the refineries operating efficiently and within industry standards and to study alternatives for meeting anticipated future clean fuel specifications. Marketing expenditures in the United States primarily included the costs of new stations built at Wal Mart stores. U.K. marketing expenditures in 2001 and 2000 were primarily for redevelopment of stores and station purchases; expenditures in 1999 were primarily for improvements and normal replacements at existing stations and terminals. Other capital expenditures in Canada in 2000 primarily consisted of the mid year acquisition of the minority interest in the Manito pipeline system. The Manito pipeline and other Canadian pipeline and trucking assets were sold by the Company in May 2001. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $635.7 million in 2001, $747.8 million in 2000 and $341.7 million in 1999. Special items decreased cash flow from operations by $32.3 million in 2001 and $2.7 million in 2000, but increased cash by $18.9 million in 1999. Changes in operating working capital other than cash and cash equivalents provided cash of $66 million in 2000, but required cash of $28 million and $35.2 million in 2001 and 1999, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities was further reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $16.4 million in 2001, $16.6 million in 2000 and $44.1 million in 1999. Cash proceeds from property sales were $173 million in 2001, $20.7 million in 2000 and $40.9 million in 1999. Borrowings under notes payable and other long term debt provided $88.2 million of cash in 2001, $175 million in 2000 and $247.8 million in 1999. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans amounted to $18.9 million in 2001, $3.8 million in 2000 and $2.3 million in 1999. Property additions and dry hole costs required $813.5 million of cash in 2001, $512.3 million in 2000 and $359.4 million in 1999. Cash outlays for debt repayment during the three years included $77.7 million in 2001, $130.5 million in 2000 and $195.9 million in 1999. The acquisition of Beau Canada in November 2000 utilized $127.5 million of cash. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $67.8 million in 2001, $65.3 million in 2000 and $63 million in 1999. Financial Condition Year end working capital totaled $38.6 million in 2001, $71.7 million in 2000 and $105.5 million in 1999. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying values for inventories under last in first out accounting were $51 million below current costs at December 31, 2001. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2001 totaled $82.7 million compared to $132.7 million a year ago and $34.1 million at the end of 1999. Long term debt was reduced by $4 million during 2001 to $520.8 million at the end of the year, 25.8% of total capital employed, and included $104.7 million of nonrecourse debt incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of the Hibernia oil field. The decrease in long term debt in 2001 was attributable to repayments of nonrecourse debt, partially offset by other new borrowings. Long term debt totaled $524.8 million at the end of 2000 compared to $393.2 million at December 31, 1999. Stockholders equity was $1.5 billion at the end of 2001 compared 14 to $1.3 billion a year ago and $1.1 billion at the end of 1999. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 5 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy had commitments of $506 million for capital projects in progress at December 31, 2001, including $206 million related to clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the Meraux refinery and $94 million for costs to develop the Medusa field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company typically relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. The Company anticipates that long term debt will increase during 2002 caused by significant capital expenditure commitments, as described in the preceding paragraph, and an expectation that oil and natural gas prices for much of 2002 will remain below trading ranges experienced in 2000 and early 2001. At December 31, 2001, the Company had access to short term and long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of $450 million, and also had unused available lines of credit with banks of $142.6 million. In addition, the Company has a shelf registration on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of up to $1 billion in debt and equity securities. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note E to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the financing arrangements currently available, the Company does not expect to have any problems in meeting future requirements for funds. At December 31, 2001, Murphy had $49 million of lease bonus and drilling costs in Property, Plant and Equipment associated with several leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. government has thus far failed to issue the permits needed to develop and produce a large natural gas discovery on Company held acreage in this area due to purported environmental concerns of the state of Florida. The Company and its co venturers have sued the U.S. government over its failure to issue such permits, and the Company cannot predict whether the U.S. government will issue the permits needed to develop the discovery, or whether the Company will be compensated by the government in the event the permits are not issued. Environmental The Companys operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect the environment and or impose remedial obligations. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the Companys operations. The Company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities, including refineries, oil and gas fields, service stations, and terminals, for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist. Under the Companys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. The Companys liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. If regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, future expenditures could exceed the accrued liability by up to an estimated $3 million. The Company has received notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it is currently considered a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at three Superfund sites and has also been assigned responsibility by defendants at another Superfund site. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. Based on currently available information, the Company has reason to believe that it is a "de minimus" party as to ultimate responsibility at the four sites. The Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs. Additionally, the Company could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at these or other Superfund sites. There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites. 15 The amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites could have a material adverse effect on future earnings. The Company does not expect that future costs for these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at December 31, 2001. The Companys refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. These costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $2.6 million in 2001. In addition to these expenses, Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Such capital expenditures were approximately $109 million in 2001 and are projected to be $166 million in 2002. A lawsuit filed against Murphy by the U.S. Government is discussed under the caption "Legal Proceedings" on page 6 of this Form 10 K report. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Because crude oil and natural gas sales prices were strong during 2000 and early 2001, prices for oil field goods and services were adversely affected.Although oil and natural gas prices have weakened in the latter part of 2001 and into 2002, it is not possible to determine what effect these lower prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements As described in Note B on page F 9 of this Form 10 K report, Murphy adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 138, effective January 1, 2001. In addition, the Company adopted a change in accounting for unsold crude oil production effective January 1, 2000 that resulted in an $8.7 million charge to earnings for the cumulative effect of the accounting change. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that all future business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized and reported as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires that amortization of goodwill be replaced with annual tests for impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives. The Company adopted SFAS No. 141 immediately and will adopt SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company had unamortized goodwill of $50.4 million at December 31, 2001, which will be subject to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 requires the Company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset. The asset retirement liability must be recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability, which is generally when the asset is placed in service. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company will increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, the Company will recognize transition adjustments for existing asset retirement obligations, long lived assets and accumulated depreciation, all net of related income tax effects, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. After adoption, any difference between costs incurred upon settlement of an asset retirement obligation and the recorded liability will be recognized as a gain or loss in the Companys earnings. 16 In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002, and its provisions are generally to be applied prospectively. At this time, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these accounting standards on the Companys financial statements, including whether any transitional goodwill impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Significant accounting policies In preparing the financial statements of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. These accounting policies are described below. . Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange o Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the Company. The Company can not predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. . Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. The Company also uses proved developed reserves to recognize expense for future estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs. Costs of exploration wells in progress at year end 2001 were not significant. . Impairment of properties The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. The Company can not predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future. . Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses 17 and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences in Ecuador and Malaysia. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets due to managements belief that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. . Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of when the Company should record losses for these based on information available to the Company. Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases and capital commitments. Total payments due after 2001 under such contractual obligations are shown below. Amounts Due (Millions of dollars) Total 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Long term debt $ 569.0 48.2 165.2 81.7 273.9 Operating leases 236.8 17.6 49.7 31.6 137.9 Capital commitments 505.5 401.6 103.9 Total $1,311.3 467.4 318.8 113.3 411.8 In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments that expire in future periods is shown below. Commitment Expiration Per Period (Millions of dollars) Total 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Financial guarantees $33.8 2.1 4.9 3.2 23.6 Letters of credit 35.6 6.8 13.3 2.2 13.3 Total $69.4 8.9 18.2 5.4 36.9 Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. During 2000 and early 2001, increased worldwide demand and disciplined management of supply by the worlds producers primarily by members of OPEC led to stronger oil prices. Due to economic slowdowns in many major countries during 2001, crude oil demand softened leading to significantly weaker sales prices. In response to lower oil prices, OPEC and other major oil producers have agreed to reduce oil production in early 2002. It is too early to determine whether these production cuts will lead to a meaningful improvement in oil prices. Due to a combination of warmer than normal weather across much of North America during the early winter of 2001 2002 and increased gas storage levels, the price of natural gas in early 2002 remained below trading ranges during most of the last two years. In addition, refined product margins in both the United States and United Kingdom were extremely weak in early 2002, leading to losses in refining and marketing operations in both areas. If oil and natural gas sales prices and refining and marketing margins continue at the levels experienced in January 2002, the Company expects that future operating results could be near break even. In such a volatile operating environment, constant reassessment of spending plans is required. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2002 was prepared during the fall of 2001 and provides for expenditures of $866 million. Of this amount, $604 million or 70%, is allocated for exploration and production. Geographically, 39% of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the United States, including $139 million for development 18 of deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico; another 36% is allocated to Canada, including $41 million for light oil and natural gas development, $28 million for continued development of the Hibernia and Terra Nova oil fields, and $49 million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations; 6% is allocated to the United Kingdom; 5% is allocated to Ecuador; and 14% is allocated to other foreign operations, which primarily includes Malaysia. Budgeted refining and marketing capital expenditures for 2002 are $259 million, including $235 million in the United States, and $12 million each in the United Kingdom and Canada. U.S. and Canadian amounts include funds to build additional stations at Wal Mart sites. U.S. amounts also include spending for clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the Meraux refinery. Due to an expectation of lower natural gas sales prices compared to the price assumptions used in the 2002 Budget, the Company has announced intentions to reduce 2002 capital expenditures by approximately $100 million. Capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted further to reflect changes in estimated cash flow during 2002. Based on the Companys projected capital expenditures in 2002 and weaker than anticipated natural gas sales prices and refining and marketing margins early in the year, a significant portion of capital expenditures is anticipated to be funded through new long term borrowings during the year. Murphys 2002 Budget anticipates an increase in long term debt of approximately $300 million during the year. Although the Company is actively managing capital expenditures in light of anticipated lower operating cash flows, it is possible that long term debt could exceed the budgeted year end 2002 levels, especially if cash flows continue to be adversely affected in upcoming months by low natural gas sales prices and weak refining and marketing margins such as those experienced in early 2002. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K report, including documents incorporated by reference herein, contains statements of the Companys expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the Companys control. These forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors, including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the Companys January 15, 1997 Form 8 K report on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. At December 31, 2001, the Company was a party to interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100 million that were designed to hedge fluctuations in cash flows of a similar amount of variable rate debt. These swaps mature in 2002 and 2004. The swaps require the Company to pay an average interest rate of 6.46% over their composite lives, and at December 31, 2001, the interest rate to be received by the Company averaged 2.28%. The variable interest rate received by the Company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly. The Company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates. As described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, the estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was a loss of $4.3 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, 26% of the Companys debt had variable interest rates and 9% was denominated in Canadian dollars. Based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2001, a 10% increase in variable interest rates would have an insignificant impact on the Companys interest expense for the next 12 months after including the favorable effect resulting from lower net settlement payments under the aforementioned interest rate swaps. A 10% increase in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would increase interest expense in 2002 by $.1 million for debt denominated in Canadian dollars. Murphy was a party to natural gas price swap agreements at December 31, 2001 for a total notional volume of 7.7 million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) that are intended to hedge a portion of the financial exposure of its Meraux, Louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the future price of natural gas purchased for fuel. In each month of settlement, the 19 swaps require Murphy to pay an average natural gas price of $2.68 per MMBTU and to receive the average NYMEX price for the final three trading days of the month. At December 31, 2001, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of $4.3 million. A 10% increase in the average NYMEX price of natural gas would have increased this asset by $2.1 million, while a 10% decrease would have reduced the asset by a similar amount. In addition, the Company was a party to natural gas swap agreements at December 31, 2001 that are intended to hedge the financial exposure of a limited portion of its U.S. natural gas production to changes in gas sales prices through March 2002. The swaps are for a notional volume that averages 32,000 MMBTU per day in the first quarter of 2002 and require Murphy to pay the average NYMEX price for the final trading day of each month and receive a price ranging from $2.54 to $2.94 per MMBTU. At December 31, 2001, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of $.8 million. A 10% increase in the average NYMEX price of natural gas would have reduced this asset by $.7 million, while a 10% decrease would have increased the asset by a similar amount.
