Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The Company reported net income in 2002 of $111.5 million, $1.21 per diluted share, compared to net income in 2001 of $330.9 million, $3.63 per share. In 2000 the Company earned $296.8 million, $3.28 per diluted share. All 2001 and 2000 earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split effective December 30, 2002. In December 2002 the Company sold its interest in Ship Shoal Block 113 in the Gulf of Mexico for an after tax gain of $10.6 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2002, the results of operations for Ship Shoal Block 113 have been reflected as discontinued operations in all years presented. Therefore, the aforementioned gain on disposal of $10.6 million in 2002, and routine operating results of the field, have been included net of income tax expense as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated statements of income for the three years ended December 31, 2002. Income from continuing operations was $97.5 million in 2002, $1.06 per share; $328.4 million in 2001, $3.60 per share; and $298.5 million in 2000, $3.30 per share. 8 Table of Contents The three year period ended December 31, 2002 included certain nonrecurring items which can obscure underlying trends of operating results and affect comparability between years. Although results excluding nonrecurring items is considered a non GAAP measure, the Companys management believes this information is useful in assessing Murphy Oils performance. Nonrecurring items reduced income from continuing operations in 2002 by $6.7 million, but increased this amount by $67.6 million in 2001 and $1.5 million in 2000. Excluding these nonrecurring items, income from continuing operations amounted to $104.2 million in 2002, $260.8 million in 2001, and $297 million in 2000. In 2000 the Company recorded a net charge of $8.7 million, $.10 per share, as the cumulative effect of an accounting change for a one time non cash adjustment to record crude oil revenues at the time the oil is sold rather than as it is produced. 2002 vs. 2001 Income from continuing operations in 2002 was $97.5 million, $1.06 per share, compared to $328.4 million, $3.60 per share, in 2001. The decline in 2002 results of $230.9 million was mainly due to a $193.6 million reduction in refining and marketing results, caused by both weaker refining margins in 2002 compared to 2001 in the U.S. and U.K. and a $74.3 million reduction in income from nonrecurring items in 2002. The lower income from nonrecurring items was primarily caused by a $71 million gain in 2001 from sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking operations. Earnings from the Companys exploration and production activities were $26.5 million lower in 2002 than in 2001 as record levels of oil and natural gas production and higher average oil prices were more than offset by lower natural gas sales prices, higher charges for property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses. Sales and other operating revenues were $222.5 million higher in 2002 than in 2001 due to record production and sales of crude oil and natural gas and higher sales volumes for refined products in North America and the United Kingdom. Gain on sale of assets declined by $96.4 million primarily due to the sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking assets in 2001. Interest and other income was $7.8 million lower in 2002 due to less interest earned on invested cash. Crude oil, natural gas and product purchases increased by $305.5 million in 2002 due to more purchases of finished products for retail marketing operations and a higher average purchase price for these products than in 2001. Operating expenses rose by $60.7 million mainly due to record oil and natural gas production, higher maintenance costs for oil and gas producing fields and $5 million of costs to repair uninsured damage from tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $73.4 million in 2002 due to higher oil and natural gas production and more retail marketing stations. Interest expense was $12.2 million more in 2002 due to higher average long term borrowings than in 2001, including the sale of 10 year notes with a stated rate of 6.375% in 2002. Capitalized interest increased by $4.3 million due to ongoing projects to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, expand Syncrude, and build a hydrocracker and expand crude oil throughput capacity at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery. Income tax expense fell by $119.5 million essentially in line with lower pretax income from continuing operations. 2001 vs. 2000 Income from continuing operations in 2001 was a company record $328.4 million, $3.60 per share, an increase of $29.9 million from the $298.5 million, $3.30 per share, earned in 2000. Record earnings in 2001 from the Companys refining and marketing operations and greater benefits from nonrecurring items were only partially offset by lower income from exploration and production activities. Improved refining and marketing results of $99.2 million were attributable to stronger unit margins in the U.S. refining business during the first half of 2001 and a $71 million nonrecurring profit on sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking operations in May 2001. Exploration and production results declined by $58.2 million in 2001 mainly caused by an 18% reduction in realized oil prices and higher exploration expenses. These were partially offset by higher oil and natural gas production and lower charges for property impairments. Sales and other operating revenues in 2001 increased by $113.8 million compared to 2000 due to higher oil, natural gas and refined product sales volumes. Gain on sale of assets was up by $101.5 million due to the sale in May 2001 of the Canadian pipeline and trucking operations. Interest and other income was $7.5 million lower in 2001 due to less interest earned on invested cash balances and lower interest associated with settlement of prior year tax issues. Crude oil, natural gas and product purchases were $46 million higher due to more purchases of crude oil and refined products, with this effort partially mitigated by a lower average price than in 2000. Operating expenses increased by $66.5 million due to higher oil and natural gas production and more retail gasoline stations. The increase of $31.3 million in exploration expenses is explained on page 14. Selling and general expenses increased by $12.4 million primarily due to higher salaries and benefits and legal and professional fees in 2001. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense rose by $15.7 million due to a combination of higher oil and gas production and more retail marketing stations. Amortization of goodwill of $3.1 million related to the acquisition of Beau Canada Exploration Ltd. (Beau Canada) in 9 Table of Contents November 2001. Impairment of properties was down by $17.4 million in 2001 due to less impairment write downs for Gulf of Mexico and western Canada properties. Interest expense was $9.4 million higher in 2001 due to higher average borrowings during the year, primarily arising from the acquisition of Beau Canada in late 2000. Capitalized interest was $6.7 million more than in 2000 primarily due to continued development expenditures for the Terra Nova field, offshore Newfoundland. Income tax expense increased by $17.7 million in 2001 due to higher pretax earnings from continuing operations. In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2002 are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Exploration and production United States $ (11.8 ) 55.3 43.3 Canada 157.0 85.5 108.1 United Kingdom 49.6 78.6 90.2 Ecuador 12.0 11.5 21.1 Malaysia (43.0 ) (36.1 ) (10.7 ) Other (2.8 ) (7.3 ) (6.3 ) 161.0 187.5 245.7 Refining and marketing North America (39.2 ) 139.6 31.5 United Kingdom (.7 ) 14.1 23.0 (39.9 ) 153.7 54.5 Corporate and other (23.6 ) (12.8 ) (1.7 ) Income from continuing operations 97.5 328.4 298.5 Discontinued operations 14.0 2.5 7.0 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 111.5 330.9 305.5 Cumulative effect of accounting change (8.7 ) Net income $ 111.5 330.9 296.8 Nonrecurring Items Income from continuing operations in the table above includes the following nonrecurring items, which can affect underlying trends of operating results and comparability between years. These nonrecurring items are presented net of tax below and are discussed in more detail following the tables. (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Gain on sale of assets $ 2.3 71.0 1.5 Tax settlements and tax rate change 14.7 8.9 25.6 Impairment of properties (20.5 ) (6.8 ) (17.8 ) Cost to repair storm damages (3.2 ) Provision for U.S. environmental matters (5.5 ) Loss on transportation and other disputed contractual items in Ecuador (7.8 ) Income (loss) from nonrecurring items $ (6.7 ) 67.6 1.5 10 Table of Contents These nonrecurring items were reflected in the following segments. (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Exploration and production United States $ (6.7 ) (5.8 ) (13.6 ) Canada 5.8 (4.2 ) United Kingdom 1.9 Ecuador (7.8 ) (6.7 ) 1.9 (25.6 ) Refining and marketing North America 64.7 64.7 Corporate and other 1.0 27.1 Income (loss) from nonrecurring items $ (6.7 ) 67.6 1.5 Gain on sale of assets An after tax gain of $2.3 million was recorded in the third quarter 2002 associated with the sale of assets. After tax gains of $67.6 million and $3.4 million were recorded in the second and fourth quarter, respectively, of 2001 for the sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking assets. After tax gains of $1.5 million were recorded in the second quarter of 2000 from the sale of U.S. corporate assets. Tax settlements and tax rate change Income of $14.7 million was recorded in the third quarter 2002 from settlement of prior year tax matters. Income of $5.5 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2001 from a reduction in a Canadian provincial tax rate. In addition, settlement of income tax matters in the U.S. and U.K. provided income of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Income of $15.5 million and $10.1 million from settlement of U.S. income tax matters was recorded in the third quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2000, respectively. Impairment of properties An after tax charge of $14.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 to write off the remaining cost in Destin Dome Blocks 56 and 57, offshore Florida. An agreement with the U.S. government restricts the Companys ability to seek approval for development of this significant natural gas discovery until at least 2012. Additionally, after tax charges of $5.9 million, $6.8 million, $13.6 million and $4.2 million were recorded in the third quarter of 2002, the fourth quarter of 2001, the third quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2000, respectively, for the write down of assets determined to be impaired. (See Note E to the consolidated financial statements.) Cost to repair storm damages An after tax charge of $3.2 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 for costs to repair uninsured equipment damages caused by tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Provision for U.S. environmental matters A $5.5 million charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2001 to resolve Clean Air Act violations at the Companys Superior, Wisconsin refinery. Loss on transportation and other disputed contractual items in Ecuador A loss of $7.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000, which included a $4.3 million expense related to prior years transportation costs, a charge of $3.2 million to establish an allowance against doubtful accounts receivable associated with disputed contractual matters, and a charge of $.3 million to settle a disputed custom fee. The effects of nonrecurring items on quarterly results of 2002 and 2001 are presented on page F 41 of this Form 10 K report. Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production operations were $161 million in 2002, $187.5 million in 2001 and $245.7 million in 2000. The decline in 2002 was caused by a 24% lower average natural gas sales price in North America, higher costs associated with property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses. The unfavorable effects of these items were partially offset by record production of both crude oil and natural gas and a 10% higher average sales price for crude oil and condensate. Oil production from continuing operations increased by 13% in 2002 to 75,213 barrels per day and natural gas production from continuing operations 11 Table of Contents rose by 5% to 292.9 million cubic feet per day. Higher property impairment expense in 2002 was mostly related to the write off of remaining costs for Destin Dome Blocks 56 and 57, offshore Florida. Based on an agreement with the U.S. government, the Company may not seek approval for development of this significant natural gas discovery in Destin Dome until at least 2012. The decline in 2001 was primarily attributable to an 18% decline in the Companys average oil sales price compared to 2000. Additionally, exploration expenses increased over 2000, a significant portion of which were in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has no realized income tax benefits. Production of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids from continuing operations increased from 63,917 barrels per day in 2000 to 66,344 in 2001, a 4% increase. Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations totaled 278.3 million cubic feet per day in 2001, up 23% from 226 million in 2000. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 36 and F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 13 of the 2002 Annual Report. A summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 United States Crude oil $ 30.0 38.5 53.2 Natural gas 111.3 192.8 211.4 Canada Crude oil 304.8 167.2 193.9 Natural gas 197.6 182.6 99.0 Synthetic oil 106.3 95.8 91.5 United Kingdom Crude oil 163.0 181.5 214.6 Natural gas 7.0 12.1 7.8 Ecuador crude oil 30.7 33.4 52.2 Total oil and gas revenues $ 950.7 903.9 923.6 The Companys crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged 75,213 barrels per day in 2002, 66,344 in 2001 and 63,917 in 2000. Oil production in the United States declined 13% to 4,128 barrels per day in 2002, following an 11% decline in 2001. The reduction in both years was primarily due to declines from existing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil production in Canada increased 34% in 2002 to a record volume of 48,239 barrels per day. The Terra Nova field, offshore Newfoundland, commenced production in January 2002 and averaged 12,463 barrels per day for the year. The Companys share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved 883 barrels per day, or 8%, in 2002 due to a combination of higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by higher capital spending related to an ongoing expansion project. Before royalties, the Companys synthetic oil production was 11,477 barrels per day in 2002, 11,157 in 2001 and 10,145 in 2000. Production of light oil decreased 982 barrels per day, or 23%, and heavy oil production decreased 19% to 9,484 barrels per day in 2002 with both decreases primarily due to declines at existing western Canada fields. Production at Hibernia rose 21% in 2002 to 11,574 barrels per day due to better operating efficiency. U.K. production was down by 1,912 barrels per day, or 9%, primarily due to declines from the Companys T Block and Ninian fields in the North Sea. The Company produced 4,544 barrels of oil per day in Ecuador, 15% lower than in 2001, primarily due to further pipeline constraints on the existing oil pipeline. An additional pipeline is scheduled to commence operation in the second half of 2003. During 2001, oil production in the United States declined 14% compared to 2000 and averaged 4,752 barrels per day. The reduction was due to declines from existing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil production in Canada increased 15% in 2001 to 36,059 barrels per day. The Companys share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved 2,036 barrels per day, or 24%, in 2001 due to both higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by increased capital spending and a lower oil price. Production of light oil increased 1,258 barrels per day, or 41%, and heavy oil production increased 11% to 11,707 barrels per day in 2001 with both increases primarily due to the Companys acquisition of Beau Canada in November 2000. Production at Hibernia rose 4% in 2001 to 9,535 barrels per day due to 12 Table of Contents better operating efficiency, primarily associated with improved handling of gas production. U.K. production was down by 681 barrels per day, or 3%, due to declines from the Companys existing fields in the North Sea. Oil production in Ecuador was 17% lower than 2000 and totaled 5,319 barrels per day. This reduction was caused by more pipeline constraints, which forced the operation to limit daily production. Worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were a record 292.9 million cubic feet per day in 2002, up from 278.3 million in 2001. Natural gas sales were 226 million cubic feet per day in 2000. Sales of natural gas in the United States were 88.1 million cubic feet per day in 2002, 112.6 million in 2001 and 141.4 million in 2000. The reductions in 2002 and 2001 were due to lower deliverability from maturing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas sales in Canada in 2002 were at record levels for the seventh consecutive year as sales increased 30% to 197.9 million cubic feet per day. Canadian natural gas sales had increased more than 100% in 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher production from the Ladyfern field, while the 2001 increase was due to the acquisition of Beau Canada in late 2000 and from new discoveries, including Ladyfern, in western Canada. Natural gas sales in the United Kingdom were 7 million cubic feet per day in 2002, down 47% compared to 2001. U.K. natural gas sales in 2001 increased 21% compared to 2000 levels and totaled 13.1 million cubic feet per day. The lower production in 2002 was due to declines at the Amethyst field in the North Sea, while the added volumes in 2001 were attributable to higher production at both the Amethyst and Mungo/Monan fields. The average sales price for light crude oil in 2002 was comparable to 2001; however, heavy oil prices were significantly stronger in comparison to light oil prices during the year. In the United States, the Companys average monthly sales price for crude oil and condensate declined 3% compared to 2001 and averaged $24.25 per barrel for the year. In Canada, the sales price for light oil rose 1% to $22.60 per barrel. Heavy oil prices in Canada averaged $16.82 per barrel, up 52% from 2001. The sales price for crude oil from the Hibernia field rose 7% to $25.34 per barrel. The average sales price for oil from the new Terra Nova field was $25.38 per barrel. Synthetic oil prices in 2002 were $25.64 per barrel, up 2% from a year ago. Sales prices in the U.K. were about flat with 2001 at $24.39 per barrel and sales prices in Ecuador were up 16% to $19.64 per barrel. Worldwide crude oil sales prices declined during 2001 compared to 2000. In the United States, the Companys average sales price for crude oil and condensate was $24.92 per barrel for the year, down 18% compared to 2000. In Canada, sales prices for light oil fell 19% to $22.40 per barrel. Canadian heavy oil prices were down 38% from 2000 and averaged $11.06 per barrel. The sales price for Hibernia crude oil decreased 12% to $23.77 per barrel. Synthetic oil prices in 2001 averaged $25.04 per barrel, down 15% from a year ago. Sales prices in the U.K. were $24.44 per barrel, a decline of 12%, and sales prices in Ecuador were down 23% to $17.00 per barrel. The Companys North American natural gas sales prices were weaker during 2002 compared to 2001 due generally to a warmer than normal winter. Natural gas sales prices in North America decreased 24% from 2001 and averaged $2.94 per MCF in 2002 compared to $3.87 in the prior year. U.S. natural gas sales prices decreased 27% in 2002 and averaged $3.37 per MCF compared to $4.64 in the prior year. Canadian natural gas production was sold in 2002 at an average price of $2.74 per MCF, 16% lower than in 2001. The sales price for natural gas sold in the United Kingdom increased 10% to $2.76 per MCF. North American natural gas sales price averaged $3.87 per MCF for the year 2001 compared to $3.90 in 2000. U.S. sales prices averaged $4.64 per MCF compared to $4.01 a year ago. However, the sales price for natural gas sold in Canada declined 11% to $3.28 per MCF. Prices in the United Kingdom increased to $2.52 per MCF from $1.81 in 2000. Based on 2002 volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1 per barrel and $.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by $17.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses were $229.6 million in 2002, $211 million in 2001 and $176.1 million in 2000. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 36 and F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years excluding discontinued operations were as follows. 13 Table of Contents (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2002 2001 2000 United States $ 5.64 4.82 3.43 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 3.48 3.84 4.24 Synthetic oil 11.75 13.58 13.06 United Kingdom 5.03 3.75 3.46 Ecuador 8.17 7.60 6.65 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 4.29 4.24 3.96 The increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the United States in both 2002 and 2001 was attributable to a combination of lower production and higher well servicing costs. Lower average costs in 2002 for Canada, excluding synthetic oil, was due to higher natural gas production volumes and new production from the Terra Nova field, offshore Newfoundland. The decrease in Canada during 2001, excluding synthetic oil, was primarily due to higher production of light oil, heavy oil and natural gas. The lower average cost per barrel for Canadian synthetic oil in 2002 was due to a combination of lower maintenance costs and higher net production, while the increased cost in 2001 was due to higher maintenance costs. The increase in average costs in the U.K. in 2002 was due to both higher costs to maintain mature properties, primarily at the Ninian field, and lower overall production. The increase in the United Kingdom during 2001 was also the result of higher costs for mature properties. Higher costs per unit in Ecuador in 2002 and 2001 were both due to lower oil production compared to the previous year. Exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 36 and F 37 on this Form 10 K report. Certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Exploration and production Dry hole costs $ 101.2 82.8 66.0 Geological and geophysical cost 23.4 36.0 36.3 Other costs 10.2 15.0 9.2 134.8 133.8 111.5 Undeveloped lease amortization 24.6 23.1 14.1 Total exploration expenses $ 159.4 156.9 125.6 The increase in dry hole costs in 2002 was caused by higher costs for unsuccessful exploration drilling wells in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, which were offset in part by lower costs in 2002 for wells off the east coast of Canada. Dry hole costs were higher in 2001 than in 2000 as more unsuccessful drilling costs off the east coast of Canada were partially offset by lower costs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Geological and geophysical costs were down in 2002 due to less spending for 3 D seismic on deepwater concessions in Malaysia. Other exploration expenses were lower in 2002 primarily due to more recoveries from the Companys partner in Malaysia. Undeveloped leasehold amortization increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily because of lease acquisitions in western Canada. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled $247.2 million in 2002, $181.1 million in 2001 and $166.6 million in 2000. Higher costs in 2002 were caused by record oil and natural gas production, including start up of the Terra Nova field in January 2002, and more production from the Ladyfern field in Western Canada. The increase in 2001 was also due to higher oil and natural gas production volumes during the year. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was lower by approximately 1.5% of pretax earnings in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to higher benefits in the latter year from settlement of prior year tax matters. Approximately 94% of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 48% of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. At December 31, 2002, about 95% of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves relate to deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, including Medusa, Front Runner and Habanero, which are currently being developed by the Company. Medusa is expected to come on stream at mid year 2003. Habanero should start up in the third quarter 2003 and 14 Table of Contents Front Runner is currently projected to produce first oil in 2004. On a worldwide basis, the Company has spent approximately $239 million in 2002, $208 million in 2001 and $111 million in 2000 to develop its undeveloped proved reserves. The Company expects to spend about $314 million in 2003, $142 million in 2004 and $62 million in 2005 to move undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently in the process of obtaining information from Murphy and other oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to assess how the industry is determining proved reserves related to new field discoveries. SEC regulations allow oil companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test or conclusive formation test. In the absence of a production test, compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of the oil or natural gas field. Production tests in deepwater environments are extremely expensive and the oil industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility. Murphy has recorded proved reserves related to the initial discovery of four offshore fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests. At the end of 2002, proved reserves for these four fields totaled 92 million barrels of oil equivalent, or approximately 20% of the Companys worldwide proved reserves, including synthetic oil. Three of the fields are currently being developed, including the Medusa, Front Runner and Habanero fields, with expected first production for these fields ranging from mid 2003 to the first half of 2004. Murphy believes the proved reserves are properly classified. Murphy has furnished the information requested by the SEC and is unable to predict the outcome of the SECs staff review of the industrys practices. This issue is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial results. If the issue is not favorably resolved, the Company may be required to revise the manner in which it reports its proved reserves, which could affect its finding costs per barrel and reserve replacement ratios. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing operations lost $39.9 million in 2002. Earnings from this business were a record $153.7 million in 2001, including nonrecurring gains, while earnings in 2000 totaled $54.5 million. The unfavorable result in 2002 was due to two reasons extremely weak refining margins throughout most of the year in both the United States and United Kingdom and a $71 million gain in 2001 on sale of the Companys former Canadian pipeline and trucking operations. Crude oil feedstock prices at the Companys U.S. and U.K. refineries were 6% and 4% higher, respectively, in 2002 than in 2001 and the increase in wholesale and retail sales prices for refined products in 2002 did not match the increased costs of crude oil in the markets served by the Company. North American operations, which now includes refining activities in the U.S. and marketing activities in the U.S. and Canada and formerly included pipeline and trucking operations in Canada prior to the sale of this business in 2001, lost $39.2 million in 2002 compared to profits of $139.6 million in 2001 and $31.5 million in 2000. The year 2001 included the aforementioned $71 million gain on sale of pipeline and trucking operations in Canada. Excluding this gain, the 2001 results were much improved over 2000 due to stronger refining and marketing margins and a higher percentage of sales through the Companys retail stations at Wal Mart sites. Prior to the sale of the Canadian operations in 2001, this business generated a profit of $3.8 million in 2001 and $7.6 million in 2000. Operations in the U.K. lost $.7 million in 2002, but earned $14.1 million and $23 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The declines in 2002 and 2001 earnings compared to the prior year in the U.K. were caused by generally weaker refining margins than in the year before. Unit margins (sales realizations less costs of crude oil, other feedstocks, refining operating expenses and depreciation and transportation to point of sale) averaged $.95 per barrel in North America in 2002, $3.23 in 2001 and $1.91 in 2000. North American product sales volumes increased 1% to a record 176,427 barrels per day in 2002, following a 17% increase in 2001. Sales volumes through the Companys retail gasoline network at Wal Mart stores continued to grow steadily throughout 2002, but lower sales volumes into the wholesale market, caused by lower finished products produced by the Companys refineries, mostly offset this increase. Higher product sales volumes in 2001 was attributable to a combination of higher crude oil throughputs compared to the previous year at the Companys U.S. refineries, plus continued expansion of the Companys retail gasoline network at Wal Mart stores. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $1.70 per barrel in 2002, $3.29 in 2001 and $4.69 in 2000. Sales of petroleum products were up 10% in 2002 to 34,204 barrels per day, while 2001 volumes were 4% higher than 2000, with both years increases caused by higher volumes sold in the cargo market. Both U.S. and U.K. operations were experiencing losses during January 2003 due to unit margins being significantly weaker during this period compared to the 2002 average. 15 Table of Contents Based on sales volumes for 2002 and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $.42 per barrel ($.01 per gallon) fluctuation in the unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by $20.5 million. The effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the Companys exploration and production segments could be affected differently. Corporate The costs of corporate activities, which include interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $23.6 million in 2002, $12.8 million in 2001 and $1.7 million in 2000. The higher net cost in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to a combination of more net interest expense associated with higher borrowings and lower interest income earned. Net costs were higher in 2001 than in 2000 mainly because the earlier year included more income tax benefits and associated interest income from settlement of prior year tax matters. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 8 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures, including discretionary exploration expenditures, were $868.1 million in 2002 compared to $864.4 million in 2001 and $557.9 million in 2000. These amounts included $134.8 million, $133.8 million and $111.5 million of exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled $631.8 million in 2002, 73% of the Companys total capital expenditures for the year. Exploration and production capital expenditures in 2002 included $18.5 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, $232.4 million for exploration activities, and $380.9 million for development projects. Development expenditures included $149.4 million for development of deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico; $27.4 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland; $54.1 million for expansion of synthetic oil operations at the Syncrude project in Canada; and $58.9 million for heavy oil and natural gas projects in western Canada. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 35 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $234.7 million in 2002, compared to $175.2 million in 2001 and $153.8 million in 2000. These amounts represented 27%, 20% and 28% of total capital expenditures of the Company in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Refining capital spending was $150.1 million in 2002, compared to $88.9 million in 2001 and $23.5 million in 2000. The Company is in the process of expanding its Meraux, Louisiana refinery by building a hydrocracker unit to meet future clean fuel specifications and is also increasing the crude oil processing capacity of the plant from 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to 125,000 barrels per day. This project is to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2003. Capital expenditures related to this expansion project amounted to $116.2 million in 2002 and $55.1 million in 2001. Marketing expenditures amounted to $84.6 million in 2002, $86.3 million in 2001 and $100.9 million in 2000. The majority of marketing expenditures in each year was related to construction of retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart sites in 21 states in the U.S. The Company began building gasoline stations at Wal Mart stores in Canada in 2002. The Company opened 125 total stations in the U.S. and Canada in 2002, 111 in 2001 and 131 in 2000. The Company acquired the minority interest in the Manito pipeline in 2000 at a cost of approximately $27 million. The Manito pipeline as well as other Canadian pipeline and trucking assets were sold in May 2001. Cash Flows Cash provided by continuing operations was $527 million in 2002, $630.6 million in 2001 and $738.1 million in 2000. Nonrecurring items decreased cash flow from continuing operations by $3.4 million in 2002, $32.3 million in 2001 and $2.7 million in 2000. The reductions in cash flow from nonrecurring items in 2002 and 2001 were mainly caused by cash income taxes related to gains on sale of assets. Changes in operating working capital other than cash and cash equivalents required cash of $24.2 million in 2002 and $28 million in 2001, but provided cash of $66 million in 2000. Cash provided by operating activities was further reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $15.2 million in 2002, $16.4 million in 2001 and $16.6 million in 2000. Cash proceeds from property sales were $68.1 million in 2002, $173 million in 2001 and $20.7 million in 2000. Borrowings under notes payable and other long term debt provided $407.6 million of cash in 2002, $88.2 million in 2001 and $175 million in 2000. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans amounted to $25.1 million in 2002, $18.9 million in 2001 and $3.8 million in 2000. Property additions and dry hole costs required $834.1 million of cash in 2002, $810.2 million in 2001 and $512.3 million in 2000. Cash outlays for debt repayment during the three years included $57.8 million in 2002, $77.7 million in 2001 16 Table of Contents and $130.5 million in 2000. The acquisition of Beau Canada in November 2000 utilized $127.5 million of cash. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $70.9 million in 2002, $67.8 million in 2001 and $65.3 million in 2000. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $.75 per share to $.80 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2002. Financial Condition Year end working capital totaled $136.3 million in 2002, $38.6 million in 2001 and $71.7 million in 2000. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying values for inventories under last in first out accounting were $129 million below current cost at December 31, 2002. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2002 totaled $165 million compared to $82.7 million a year ago and $132.7 million at the end of 2000. Long term debt increased by $342 million during 2002 to $862.8 million at the end of the year, 35.1% of total capital employed, and included $74.3 million of nonrecourse debt incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of the Hibernia oil field. The increase in long term debt in 2002 was attributable to new borrowings associated with the Companys capital expenditure program, including deepwater Gulf of Mexico development projects, continued expansion of the Syncrude plant and an expansion project at the Companys Meraux, Louisiana refinery. Long term debt totaled $520.8 million at the end of 2001 compared to $524.8 million at December 31, 2000. Stockholders equity was $1.6 billion at the end of 2002 compared to $1.5 billion a year ago and $1.3 billion at the end of 2000. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 5 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy had commitments of $623 million for capital projects in progress at December 31, 2002, including $82.1 million related to clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the Meraux refinery; $126.3 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, including Medusa, Front Runner and Habanero; $110.2 million for continued expansion of synthetic oil operations in Canada; and $121.8 million for future combined work commitments in Malaysia and offshore Nova Scotia. The expansion projects at the Meraux refinery include construction of a hydrocracker unit that will allow the refinery to produce low sulfur products, an expansion of the crude oil processing capacity from 100,000 barrels per day to 125,000 barrels per day, and construction of an additional sulfur recovery complex. See further discussion regarding the Meraux projects on page 4 of this Form 10 K report. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company typically relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. The Company anticipates that long term debt will increase during 2003 because of significant capital expenditure commitments, as described in the preceding paragraph, and an expectation that oil and natural gas prices for much of 2003 will remain below trading ranges experienced in 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Company had access to short term and long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of $488 million. In addition, the Company has a shelf registration on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of up to $650 million in debt and equity securities. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note F to the consolidated financial statements. At February 1, 2003 the Companys long term debt rating by Standard and Poors was A and by Moodys was Baal. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.2 to 1 in 2002, 11.3 to 1 in 2001 and 13.4 to 1 in 2000. Environmental Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the Companys operations are: The Clean Air Act, as amended The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Safe Drinking Water Act Regulations of the United States Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations These acts and their associated regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. Many states also have similar statutes and regulations governing air and water, which in some cases impose additional and 17 Table of Contents more stringent requirements. Murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills. The applicable acts are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), commonly referred to as Superfund, and comparable state statutes. CERCLA primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites. As discussed below, Murphy is involved in a limited number of Superfund sites. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and comparable state statutes, govern the management and disposal of wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owners property. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, under which owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. Pursuant to the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used. Pursuant to state laws corresponding to the CAA, several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the Companys operations. The Company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities, including three refineries, 11 terminals, and approximately 80 service stations, for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist. In addition the Company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation; this cost is generally provided for within the Companys liability for accrued dismantlement costs. Under the Companys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. The Companys liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. If regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, future expenditures could exceed the accrued liability by up to an estimated $3 million. The Company has received notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it is currently considered a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at two Superfund sites. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. At one site the Company has agreed to pay $8,100 to obtain a release from further obligations. The Companys insurance carrier has agreed to reimburse the $8,100. Based on currently available information, the Company has reason to believe that it is also a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at the other Superfund site. The Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the one remaining site or other Superfund sites. The Company does not believe that the ultimate costs to clean up the two Superfund sites will have a material adverse effect on its net income or cash flows in a future period. There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites. However, based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on future earnings or cash flows. Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at December 31, 2002. 18 Table of Contents The Companys refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils, laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and various industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to $3.3 million in 2002. In addition to these expenses, Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Such capital expenditures were approximately $166 million in 2002 and are projected to be $120 million in 2003. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Because crude oil and natural gas sales prices were strong during late 2002 and early 2003, prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected in the future. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements As described in Note B on page F 10 of this Form 10 K report, Murphy adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, effective January 1, 2001. In addition, the Company adopted a change in accounting for unsold crude oil production effective January 1, 2000 that resulted in an $8.7 million charge to earnings in 2000 for the cumulative effect of the accounting change. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that all future business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized and reported as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires that amortization of goodwill be replaced with annual tests for impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives. The Company adopted SFAS No. 141 upon its issuance and adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company had unamortized goodwill of $51 million at December 31, 2002, which has been tested for impairment as required by SFAS No. 142 at year end 2002. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The Company adopted the provision of SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no impact on the Company. In the fourth quarter 2002, the Company sold its interest in Ship Shoal Block 113 at a gain of $10.6 million. Following the guidance of SFAS No. 144, Murphy has recorded the gain on disposal, plus the normal operating results, of Ship Shoal Block 113 as discontinued operations for all years presented. The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02 3 in the fourth quarter 2002. This consensus requires that the results of energy trading activities be recorded on a net margin basis. Accordingly, Murphy has reflected the results of its crude oil trading activities as net revenue in its income statement, and previously reported revenues and cost of sales have been reduced by equal and offsetting amounts, with no changes to net income or cash flows. The effect of this reclassification was a net reduction of both net sales and cost of crude oil, natural gas and product purchases by approximately $269 million in 2002, $600 million in 2001 and $1.03 billion in 2000. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires the Company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset. The asset retirement 19 Table of Contents liability must be recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability, which is generally when the asset is placed in service. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company will increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, the Company will recognize transition adjustments for existing asset retirement obligations, long lived assets and accumulated depreciation, all net of related income tax effects, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. After adoption, any difference between costs incurred upon settlement of an asset retirement obligation and the recorded liability will be recognized as a gain or loss in the Companys earnings. The Company is unable to estimate the financial statement impact as of January 1, 2003 from adoption of SFAS No. 143. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary, as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the risk management strategy of many companies. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13 to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions. The provisions of the Statement related to the rescission of Statement No. 4 is applied in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Earlier application of these provisions is encouraged. The provisions of the Statement related to Statement No. 13 were effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issues SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirement for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51. This Interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the Interpretation. The Interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after January 31, 2003. For public enterprises with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003, the Interpretation is applied no later than the beginning of the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The application of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. The Interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003 if it is reasonably 20 Table of Contents possible that the Company will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the Interpretation becomes effective. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. These accounting policies are described below. Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the Company. The Company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. The Company also uses proved developed reserves to recognize expense for future estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs. Costs of exploration wells in progress at year end 2002 were not significant. Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. The Company can not predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences in Ecuador and Malaysia. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to Ecuador and Malaysia due to managements belief that these assets are not likely to be realized. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. 21 Table of Contents Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company.

During late 2002 and early 2003, crude oil prices increased significantly primarily due to the near term potential for a conflict between Iraq and a U.S. led coalition of armed forces coupled with a nationwide oil worker strike in Venezuela that virtually halted oil exports from this OPEC nation. Because of the generally recognized war premium built into oil prices in early 2003, earnings and cash flows from the Companys refining and marketing operations remained very weak. Natural gas prices in late 2002 and early 2003 were stronger than the average for 2002, mainly due to a combination of cold weather in the early winter period and lower gas storage levels compared to the same time a year earlier. If a conflict in Iraq occurs, worldwide crude oil prices could change significantly depending on the wars effect on Middle Eastern oil production. In such a volatile environment, constant reassessment of spending plans is required. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2003 was prepared during the fall of 2002 and provides for expenditures of $952 million. Of this amount, $734 million or 77%, is allocated for exploration and production. Geographically, 39% of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the United States, including $191 million for development of deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico; another 32% is allocated to Canada, including $23 million for natural gas development, $28 million for heavy oil development, $30 million for continued development of the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields, and $69 million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations; 21% is allocated to exploration and development in Malaysia; and the remaining 8% is planned for other areas, including Ecuador and the United Kingdom. Budgeted refining and marketing capital expenditures for 2003 are $216 million, including $201 million in North America and $15 million in the United Kingdom. Planned spending in North America include funds to complete the clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the Meraux refinery and to build over 100 additional gasoline stations at Wal Mart sites. Capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect changes in estimated cash flow during 2003. 22 Table of Contents Based on the Companys projected capital expenditures in 2003 and continued refining and marketing margins early in the year, a portion of capital expenditures is anticipated to be funded through new long term borrowings during the year. Murphys 2003 Budget anticipates an increase in long term debt of approximately $200 million during the year. Although the Company is actively managing capital expenditures in light of operating cash flows, it is possible that long term debt could exceed the budgeted year end 2003 levels, especially if cash flows are adversely affected in the upcoming months by a weakening of oil and natural gas sales prices and continued weak refining and marketing margins such as those experienced in late 2002 and early 2003. In order to reduce volatility of oil and natural gas prices, the Company has entered into a series of financial contracts that cover approximately 25% of the Companys anticipated 2003 oil and natural gas production. The swap and collar contracts are accounted for as qualified hedges of 2003 sales prices and are more fully described on page 24 of this report. Murphys oil and natural gas production profile will continue to grow in 2003. Two new deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, Medusa and Habanero, will start up in 2003. Also, the West Patricia field in Block SK 309, offshore Sarawak, Malaysia is expected to produce first oil in the second quarter of 2003. A new heavy oil pipeline in Ecuador that is owned by others should be online in late 2003; this should allow the Companys daily production to more than double in this country by year end 2003. These new fields will more than offset normal production declines at other fields. Total production for 2003 should average 130,000 to 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In early 2003, the Company signed a letter of intent to sell its interests in the Ninian and Columba fields in the U.K. North Sea at a price of $36 million. This sale is expected to close in the second quarter 2003. Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. During 2002, the Company reduced the expected investment return for assets held in its U.S. retirement plans from 8.5% to 8.0%. The Company has decided to reduce its expected return to 7.5% in 2003. Due to a reduction in bond yields during 2002, the Company has also reduced the plans discount rates from 7.25% in 2002 to 6.75% in 2003. The funded status of the Companys retirement plans was adversely affected over the last two years by changes in assumptions used to calculate plan liabilities and a negative actual return on plan assets. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tend to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns. The effect of negative asset returns and liability changes will adversely impact the Companys pension expense in 2003. The Companys annual retirement plan expense is estimated to increase by about $8 million for 2003 compared to 2002. The Company is required to fund payments of $.3 million into one union plan in 2003. Unless asset values recover during the next few years, the Companys pension expense will continue to be adversely affected by negative asset returns experienced in recent years. In addition, the Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. The Company was a party to interest rate swaps at December 31, 2002 with notional amounts totaling $50 million that were designed to hedge fluctuations in cash flows of a similar amount of variable rate debt. These swaps mature in 2004. The swaps require the Company to pay an average interest rate of 6.17% over their composite lives, and at December 31, 2002, the interest rate to be received by the Company averaged 1.64%. The variable interest rate received by the Company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly. The Company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates. The estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was recorded as a liability of $3.8 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, 20% of the Companys debt had variable interest rates and 4.6% was denominated in Canadian dollars. Based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, a 10% increase in variable interest rates would increase the Companys interest expense in 2003 by approximately $.2 million after including the favorable effect resulting from lower net settlement payments under the aforementioned interest rate swaps. A 10% increase in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would increase interest expense in 2003 by $.9 million for debt denominated in Canadian dollars. Murphy was a party to natural gas swap agreements at December 31, 2002 for a total notional volume of 9.2 MMBTU that are intended to hedge the financial exposure of its Meraux, Louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the future price of a portion of natural gas to be purchased for fuel during 2004 through 2006. In each month of settlement, the swaps require Murphy to pay an average natural gas price of $2.78 per MMBTU and to receive the average NYMEX price for the final three trading days of the month. At December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of $12.4 million. A 10% increase in the average NYMEX price of natural gas would have increased this asset by $3.7 million, while a 10% decrease would have reduced the asset by a similar amount. The Company was a party to natural gas swap agreements and natural gas collar agreements at December 31, 2002 that are intended to hedge the financial exposure of a limited portion of its 2003 U.S. and Canadian natural gas production to changes in gas sales prices. The swap agreements are for a combined notional volume that averages 24,200 MMBTU per day and require Murphy to pay the average relevant index price for each month and receive an average price of $3.76 per MMBTU. The collar agreements are for a combined notional volume of 26,700 MMBTU per day and based upon the relevant index prices provide Murphy with an average floor price of $3.24 per MMBTU and an average ceiling price of $4.64 per MMBTU. At December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as a liability of $6.4 million, with the offsetting loss recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) in Stockholders Equity. A 10% increase in the average index price of natural gas would have increased this liability by $3.7 million, while a 10% decrease would have reduced the liability by a similar amount. In addition, the Company was a party to crude oil swap agreements at December 31, 2002 that are intended to hedge the financial exposure of a limited portion of its 2003 U.S. and Canadian crude oil production to changes in crude oil sales prices. A portion of the swap agreements cover a notional volume of 22,000 barrels per day of light oil and require Murphy to pay the average of the closing settlement price on the NYMEX for the Nearby Light Crude Futures Contract for each month and receive an average price of $25.30 per barrel. Additionally, there are heavy oil swap agreements with a notional volume of 10,000 barrels per day that require Murphy to pay the arithmetic average of the posted prices for each month at the Kerrobert and Hardisty terminals in Canada and receive an average price of $16.74 per barrel. At December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as a liability of $19.9 million, with the offsetting loss recorded in AOCL in Stockholders Equity. A 10% increase in the average index price of crude oil would have increased this liability by $28 million, while a 10% decrease would have reduced the liability by a similar amount. 24 Table of Contents
