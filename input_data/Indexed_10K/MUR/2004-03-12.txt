Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in North America and the United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue primarily by selling its oil and natural gas production and its refined petroleum products to third parties at hundreds of locations in the United States, Canada and other countries. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in North America that are primarily located at Wal Mart stores, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys downstream operations are dependent upon achieving an adequate margin, which is determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of refinery feedstocks and gasoline purchases and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions. In general, worldwide oil prices and North American natural gas prices were stronger in 2003 than in 2002. The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in 2003 was $31.00, an increase of 18% compared to 2002. The NYMEX natural gas price averaged $5.49 in 2003, up 63% over 2002. These price improvements were a significant factor leading to higher profits in the Companys exploration and production business in 2003 compared to the prior year. The Company did not fully benefit from the higher prices in 2003, because approximately 30% of its 2003 oil and natural gas production was hedged at prices that were lower than actual market prices in 2003. In addition, the higher prices for crude oil were a contributing factor to low refining and marketing margins in North America during a portion of 2003. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in 2004 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. Results of Operations The Company reported net income in 2003 of $294.2 million, $3.17 per diluted share, compared to net income in 2002 of $111.5 million, $1.21 per diluted share. In 2001 the Company earned $330.9 million, $3.63 per diluted share. The higher net income in 2003 compared to 2002 was caused by a combination of better earnings in the Companys exploration and production operations, a lower loss in refining and marketing operations, and lower net costs for corporate functions. The income reduction in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to lower earnings in the exploration and production business, significantly lower earnings in the refining and marketing area, and higher net costs for corporate functions. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Company recorded an expense of $7 million, net of $1.4 million in income taxes, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Further explanation of this accounting change is included in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $301.2 million ($3.25 per share) in 2003, $111.5 million ($1.21 per share) in 2002, and $330.9 million ($3.63 per share) in 2001. In December 2002 the Company sold its interest in Ship Shoal Block 113 in the Gulf of Mexico. The results of operations for Ship Shoal Block 113 have been reflected as discontinued operations in 2002 and 2001 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Therefore, the gain on disposal of $10.6 million in 2002 and other operating results of the field have been included net of income tax expense as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Income from continuing operations was $301.2 million ($3.25 per share) in 2003, $97.5 million ($1.06 per share) in 2002, and $328.4 million ($3.60 per share) in 2001. 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2003 vs. 2002 Net income in 2003 was $294.2 million, $3.17 per diluted share, compared to $111.5 million, $1.21 per diluted share, in 2002. The 2003 period included an after tax expense of $7 million, $.08 per share, related to a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The 2002 period included profit on discontinued operations of $14 million, $.15 per share. Excluding the accounting change in 2003 and the results of discontinued operations in 2002, income from continuing operations was $301.2 million, $3.25 per share, in 2003, and $97.5 million, $1.06 per share, in 2002. The $203.7 million higher income from continuing operations in 2003 compared to 2002 was attributable to $165.2 million higher earnings from exploration and production operations, a $28.7 million lower loss from refining and marketing operations and a $9.8 million lower net cost of corporate activities. Earnings from exploration and production operations were up in 2003 primarily due to higher oil and natural gas sales prices, a $34 million after tax gain on sale of the Ninian and Columba fields in the U.K. North Sea, record levels of oil production, higher tax benefits from settlement and rate adjustments, and lower property impairment and exploration expenses. Sales of natural gas were down significantly in 2003 primarily due to lower gas production in Canada. Refining and marketing results in both North America and the United Kingdom showed significant improvements in 2003. Most of the improvement in North America was generated by stronger margins in the retail marketing portion of the business. Higher margins in the U.K. led to better income from this area. The net costs of corporate activities were lower in 2003 primarily due to higher corporate income tax benefits related to settlement of prior year tax matters and lower net interest costs, partially offset by higher selling and general expenses. Sales and other operating revenues in 2003 increased by $1.3 billion compared to 2002 due to higher sales volumes for crude oil and refined petroleum products, higher sales prices for oil, natural gas and refined products, and higher merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations. Gain on sale of assets was $52.4 million higher in 2003 primarily due to a $50 million pretax profit on sale of the Ninian and Columba fields in the U.K. North Sea. Crude oil, natural gas and product purchases expense increased by $975.9 million in 2003 due to higher costs of crude oil used for refinery feedstock, and higher costs and volumes of gasoline and merchandise purchased for sale at the Companys retail gasoline stations. Operating expenses increased by $86.7 million in 2003 due to higher operating and repair costs at refineries and higher operating costs at the Companys growing retail gasoline station chain. Selling and general expenses rose by $28 million in 2003 primarily due to higher retirement and incentive compensation expenses and higher costs for Malaysian operations. Exploration expenses were $8.3 million lower in 2003 mostly due to less exploratory costs incurred in Malaysia. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased by $28.5 million in 2003 due to new production from the West Patricia field, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, and higher depreciation associated with the Companys growing retail gasoline station chain. Impairment of long lived assets was $23.3 million lower in 2003 as the prior year included costs related to write off of Destin Dome Blocks 56 and 57, offshore Florida. The 2003 statement of income included $12.4 million for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the time the abandonment occurs. Interest expense rose by $6.2 million in 2003 due to higher average borrowings under long term debt during the year. The portion of interest capitalized increased by $12.7 million due to higher capital expenditures for development of deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields and expansion projects at Syncrude and the Meraux refinery. Income tax expense was $63.8 million more in 2003 mostly caused by higher pretax earnings, the effects of which were partially offset by a $20.1 million benefit from settlement of prior year tax audits in the U.S., an $11.8 million benefit related to enacted tax rate reductions in Canada, and an $11.4 million credit from recognition of deferred tax benefits in Malaysia. 2002 vs. 2001 Income from continuing operations in 2002 was $97.5 million, $1.06 per share, compared to $328.4 million, $3.60 per share, in 2001. Lower income in 2002 of $230.9 million was mainly due to a $193.6 million reduction in refining and marketing results, caused by both weaker refining margins in 2002 compared to 2001 in the U.S. and U.K., and a $71 million gain in 2001 from sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking operations. Earnings from the Companys exploration and production activities were $26.5 million lower in 2002 than in 2001 as higher oil production, record levels of natural gas production and higher average oil sales prices were more than offset by lower natural gas sales prices, higher charges for property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses. Sales and other operating revenues were $222.5 million higher in 2002 than in 2001 due to higher crude oil production, record sales of natural gas, and higher sales volumes for refined products in North America and the United Kingdom. Gain on sale of assets declined by $96.4 million primarily due to the sale of Canadian pipeline and trucking assets in 2001. Interest and other income was $7.8 million lower in 2002 due to less interest earned on invested cash. Crude oil, natural gas and product purchases expense increased by $305.5 million in 2002 due to more purchases of finished 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements products for retail marketing operations and a higher average purchase price for these products than in 2001. Operating expenses rose by $60.7 million mainly due to higher oil and natural gas production, higher maintenance costs for oil and gas producing fields and $5 million of costs to repair uninsured damage from tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $73.4 million in 2002 due to higher oil and natural gas production and more retail gasoline stations. Interest expense was $12.2 million more in 2002 due to higher average long term borrowings than in 2001, including the sale of 10 year notes with a stated rate of 6.375% in 2002. Capitalized interest increased by $4.3 million due to ongoing projects to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, expand Syncrude, and build a hydrocracker and expand crude oil throughput capacity at the Meraux refinery. Income tax expense fell by $119.5 million essentially in line with lower pretax income from continuing operations. In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2003 are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Exploration and production United States $ 23.3 (11.8 ) 55.3 Canada 189.0 157.0 85.5 United Kingdom 95.3 49.6 78.6 Ecuador 16.7 12.0 11.5 Malaysia 10.7 (43.0 ) (36.1 ) Other (8.8 ) (2.8 ) (7.3 ) 326.2 161.0 187.5 Refining and marketing North America (21.2 ) (39.2 ) 139.6 United Kingdom 10.0 (.7 ) 14.1 (11.2 ) (39.9 ) 153.7 Corporate and other (13.8 ) (23.6 ) (12.8 ) Income from continuing operations 301.2 97.5 328.4 Discontinued operations 14.0 2.5 Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 301.2 111.5 330.9 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (7.0 ) Net income $ 294.2 111.5 330.9 Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production operations were $326.2 million in 2003, $161 million in 2002 and $187.5 million in 2001. The improvement in earnings in 2003 was primarily caused by a 7% higher realized worldwide oil sales price, a 64% higher realized natural gas sales price in North America, record crude oil production that was 9% higher than in 2002, a $34 million after tax gain on sale of the Ninian and Columba fields in the U.K. North Sea, higher tax benefits from settlements and rate adjustments, and lower expenses related to property impairments and exploration. Natural gas sales volumes were 27% lower in 2003, primarily due to a decline in production at the Ladyfern field in Canada. Higher oil production was mostly attributable to start up in May 2003 of the West Patricia field, offshore Sarawak Malaysia. The reduction in property impairment expense in 2003 was primarily related to the write off of the remaining costs for Destin Dome Blocks 56 and 57, offshore Florida, in 2002. The decline in exploration expenses was mostly attributable to lower exploratory costs in Malaysia. Lower earnings in 2002 compared to 2001 was caused by a 24% lower average natural gas sales price in North America, higher costs associated with property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses. The unfavorable effects of these items were partially offset by higher production of crude oil, record levels of natural gas sales, and a 10% higher average sales price for crude oil and condensate. Oil production from continuing operations increased by 13% in 2002 and natural gas production from continuing operations rose by 5%. Higher property impairment expense in 2002 was mostly related to the write off of remaining costs for Destin Dome Blocks 56 and 57, offshore Florida. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 38 and F 39 of this Form 10 K report. Daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 8 of the 2003 Annual Report. 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2003 2002 2001 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 39.2 30.0 38.5 Natural gas 158.3 111.3 192.8 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 353.3 304.8 167.2 Natural gas 203.8 197.6 182.6 Synthetic oil 95.7 106.3 95.8 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 158.6 163.0 181.5 Natural gas 12.2 7.0 12.1 Malaysia crude oil 77.7 Ecuador crude oil 41.9 30.7 33.4 Total oil and gas revenues $ 1,140.7 950.7 903.9 The Companys crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged 83,452 barrels per day in 2003, 75,213 barrels in 2002 and 66,344 barrels in 2001. Oil production in 2003 was a new annual record for Murphy Oil. Oil production from continuing operations in the United States increased 10% to 4,526 barrels per day. Production from two new deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields Medusa and Habanero that came on stream in November 2003 more than offset production declines from mature fields. Oil production in Canada increased 7% in 2003 to a record volume of 51,767 barrels per day. The 2003 production increase was primarily related to higher volumes produced offshore Newfoundland at the Terra Nova and Hibernia fields. Production at Terra Nova increased 26% and averaged 15,712 barrels per day in 2003. Hibernia production increased by 11% to 12,822 barrels per day in 2003. Net production from the synthetic oil operation known as Syncrude fell 879 barrels per day, or 8%, in 2003 due to less efficient operations caused by more downtime for repairs. Production of light oil decreased 568 barrels per day, or 17%, due to continued field decline and various property sales during the year. Heavy oil production in Canada increased 478 barrels per day, or 5%, during 2003 due to the results of development drilling, which was partially offset by lower production from various properties sold during the year. U.K. production was down by 3,616 barrels per day, or 20%, primarily due to sale of the Ninian and Columba fields in mid 2003 and production decline at the Mungo/Monan field. The Company produced 5,172 barrels of oil per day in Ecuador, 14% higher than in 2002, primarily due to a new heavy oil pipeline that began operations in the last half of 2003. Production began at the Companys West Patricia field in Block SK 309, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, in May 2003. Net production from West Patricia averaged 7,301 barrels per day for all 2003, but averaged over 11,000 barrels per day since start up. During 2002, oil production from continuing operations in the United States declined 13% compared to 2001 and averaged 4,128 barrels per day. The reduction was due to declines from existing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil production in Canada increased 34% in 2002 to 48,239 barrels per day. The Companys share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved 883 barrels per day, or 8%, in 2002 due to a combination of higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by increased capital spending related to an ongoing expansion project. Production of light oil decreased 982 barrels per day, or 23%, and heavy oil production decreased 19% to 9,484 barrels per day in 2002 with both decreases primarily due to declines at existing Western Canada fields. Production at Hibernia rose 21% in 2002 to 11,574 barrels per day due to better operating efficiency, primarily associated with improved handling of gas production. The Terra Nova field started up in January 2002 and averaged 12,463 barrels per day in 2002. U.K. production was down by 1,912 barrels per day, or 9%, in 2002 primarily due to declines from the Companys T Block and Ninian fields in the North Sea. Oil production in Ecuador was 15% lower than 2001 and totaled 4,544 barrels per day. This reduction was caused by more pipeline constraints, which forced the operation to limit daily production. Worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were 215.3 million cubic feet per day in 2003, 292.9 million in 2002 and 278.3 million in 2001. The total for 2002 was a Company record for natural gas sales. Sales of natural gas in the United States were 82.3 million cubic feet per day in 2003, 88.1 million in 2002 and 112.6 million in 2001. The reductions in 2003 and 2002 were due to lower deliverability from mature fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas sales in Canada fell from a record level of 197.9 million cubic feet per day in 2002 to 123.5 million in 2003. The 38% reduction in 2003 was mostly caused by a steep production decline at the Ladyfern field. Canadian natural gas sales had increased 30% in 2002 due to higher production from the Ladyfern field. Natural gas sales in the United Kingdom were 9.6 million cubic feet per day in 2003, up 37% compared to 2002. U.K. natural gas sales in 2002 decreased 47% compared to 2001 levels and totaled 7 million cubic feet per day. The change in U.K. sales in each year was due primarily to the level of sales nominations at the Amethyst field in the North Sea. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Worldwide crude oil sales prices were higher in 2003 than in 2002 due to a strengthening world economy and effective production output controls by OPEC producers. The Companys average realized sales price for crude oil and condensate was $25.27 per barrel in 2003 compared to $23.59 in 2002. The worldwide average price was reduced $2.25 per barrel by the effects of the Companys 2003 hedging program. The Company had hedged the sales price in 2003 for most of its heavy oil production in Canada and light oil production in the U.S., as well as a portion of its offshore and synthetic crude production in Canada. The U.S. average crude oil sales price was essentially flat with 2002 and averaged $24.22 per barrel. Light oil production in Canada was sold at an average of $27.39 per barrel in 2003, up 21% from 2002. Heavy Canadian oil sold at $12.34 per barrel in 2003, 27% lower than in 2002. The average 2003 sales prices for offshore and synthetic oil production in Canada were $27.08 per barrel and $24.97 per barrel, respectively. Offshore prices were 7% higher than 2002, but synthetic crude was lower by 3%. The average sales price in the U.K. increased by 21% to $29.59 per barrel. Ecuador production was sold at an average of $22.99 per barrel, which was 17% above the average for 2002. New production from the West Patricia field in Malaysia brought an average of $29.42 per barrel in 2003. The average sales price for light crude oil in 2002 was comparable to 2001; however, heavy oil prices were significantly stronger in comparison to light oil prices during the year. In the United States, the Companys average monthly sales price for crude oil and condensate declined 3% compared to 2001 and averaged $24.25 per barrel for the year. In Canada, the sales price for light oil rose 1% to $22.60 per barrel. Heavy oil prices in Canada averaged $16.82 per barrel, up 52% from 2001. The sales price for crude oil from the Hibernia field rose 7% to $25.34 per barrel. The average sales price for oil from the new Terra Nova field was $25.38 per barrel. Synthetic oil prices in 2002 were $25.64 per barrel, up 2% from the prior year. Sales prices in the U.K. were about flat with 2001 at $24.39 per barrel and sales prices in Ecuador were up 16% to $19.64 per barrel. The sales prices for natural gas were much stronger in 2003 than in 2002 as high demand coupled with a tight supply buoyed prices. The average sales price realized by the Company in North America in 2003 was 64% higher than in 2002 and averaged $4.83 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the year. This price was reduced by $.17 per MCF because of the Companys hedging program in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., natural gas sales prices averaged $5.29 per MCF in 2003, up 57% compared to 2002. Canadian gas prices increased 65% to an average of $4.52 per MCF. Natural gas was sold in the U.K. at an average of $3.50 per MCF, 27% higher than the 2002 average. During 2002, the Companys North American natural gas sales prices were weaker than in 2001 generally due to a warmer than normal winter. Natural gas sales prices in North America decreased 24% from 2001 and averaged $2.94 per MCF in 2002 compared to $3.87 in the prior year. U.S. natural gas sales prices decreased 27% in 2002 and averaged $3.37 per MCF compared to $4.64 in the prior year. Canadian natural gas production was sold in 2002 at an average price of $2.74 per MCF, 16% lower than in 2001. The sales price for natural gas sold in the United Kingdom increased 10% to $2.76 per MCF. Based on 2003 volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1 per barrel and $.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by $19.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses were $234.2 million in 2003, $229.6 million in 2002 and $211 million in 2001. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 38 and F 39 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel excluding discontinued operations during the last three years are shown in the following table. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2003 2002 2001 United States $ 5.54 5.64 4.82 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 3.59 3.48 3.84 Synthetic oil 16.43 11.75 13.58 United Kingdom 4.69 5.03 3.75 Malaysia 3.44 Ecuador 9.05 8.17 7.60 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 4.33 4.29 4.24 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The lower costs in the United States in 2003 were due to both higher production and less well servicing costs. The increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the U.S. in 2002 was attributable to a combination of lower production and more well servicing. Higher average Canadian costs excluding synthetic oil in 2003 was caused by lower natural gas production and a higher average foreign exchange rate. The lower average cost in 2002 for Canada, excluding synthetic oil, was due to higher natural gas production volumes and new production from the Terra Nova field, offshore Newfoundland. The increase in unit costs for Canadian synthetic oil operations in 2003 was attributable to a combination of lower production, higher maintenance costs and a higher foreign exchange rate. The lower average cost per barrel for Canadian synthetic oil in 2002 was due to a combination of lower maintenance costs and higher net production. Lower average costs in the U.K. in 2003 was mainly due to the sale of the high cost Ninian and Columba fields in the second quarter. The increase in average costs in the U.K. in 2002 was due to both higher costs to maintain mature properties, primarily at the Ninian field, and lower overall production. Production expense increases per unit in Ecuador in 2003 were mostly attributable to higher transportation costs associated with the new heavy oil pipeline. Higher costs per unit in Ecuador in 2002 were due to lower oil production compared to the previous year. Exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 38 and F 39 on this Form 10 K report. Certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Exploration and production Dry holes $ 82.5 101.2 82.8 Geological and geophysical 34.0 23.4 36.0 Other 7.4 10.2 15.0 123.9 134.8 133.8 Undeveloped lease amortization 27.2 24.6 23.1 Total exploration expenses $ 151.1 159.4 156.9 Dry hole costs were $18.7 million lower in 2003 than 2002 primarily due to more drilling success in deepwater Malaysia blocks. The $18.4 million increase in dry hole costs in 2002 was caused by higher costs for unsuccessful exploration drilling wells in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, which were offset in part by lower costs in 2002 for wells off the east coast of Canada. Geological and geophysical expenses were up $10.6 million in 2003 mostly due to 3D seismic acquisition and processing in Blocks SK 309 and PM 311 in Malaysia. Geological and geophysical costs were down $12.6 million in 2002 due to less spending for 3D seismic on deepwater concessions in Malaysia. Other exploration expenses were $2.8 million lower in 2003 because more administrative costs in Malaysia were charged to the production department after start up of West Patricia field production in May. Other exploration expenses were $4.8 million lower in 2002 primarily due to more charges to the Companys partner in Malaysia. Undeveloped leasehold amortization increased by $2.6 million in 2003 and $1.5 million in 2002 primarily because of lease acquisitions in each year in the Gulf of Mexico and Western Canada. A total cost of $5 million was incurred in 2002 to repair equipment and well damages caused by tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. These costs essentially represent amounts not recovered through insurance policies. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled $268.2 million in 2003, $247.2 million in 2002 and $181.1 million in 2001. The $21 million increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was caused primarily by start up of the West Patricia field in 2003. Higher costs of $66.1 million in 2002 were caused by higher oil and natural gas production, including start up of the Terra Nova field in January 2002 and more production from the Ladyfern field in Western Canada. The exploration and production business recorded $12.3 million of expense in 2003 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. Property impairments occurred in the United States in each of the three years ended December 31, 2003. The amount of impairments in 2002 was significantly higher than 2003 and 2001 because the Company wrote off its remaining investment of $22.5 million in Destin Dome Blocks 56 and 57, offshore Florida. Based on an agreement with the U.S. government, the Company may not seek approval for development of this significant natural gas discovery until at least 2012. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 32.9% in 2003, 38.4% in 2002 and 39.9% in 2001. The lower rate in 2003 was attributable to several factors. The Company sold its interests in the Ninian and Columba fields in 2003. Profits on these fields were assessed Petroleum Revenue taxes in addition to normal corporation taxes; thus the sale of these fields reduced the overall effective tax rate in the U.K. In addition, the Company recorded an $11.4 million deferred tax credit in 2003 to recognize anticipated future tax benefits on previously incurred expenses related to Blocks SK 309 and 311 in Malaysia. These benefits had not been recognized in the income statement in previous years because the Company had established a deferred tax valuation allowance until such time that it became probable that these expenses would be used to offset future taxable income. Also in 2003, both the Federal and Alberta governments of Canada reduced their tax rates for oil and gas companies. The rate reductions led to recognition of an $11.8 million tax benefit, mostly related to a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities. The effective tax rate in 2002 was lower than in 2001 primarily due to higher benefits in the latter year from settlement of prior year tax matters. Approximately 69% of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 39% of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. At December 31, 2003, about 93% of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis relate to deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, including Medusa, Habanero and Front Runner. The Medusa and Habanero fields came on stream in November 2003 and a portion of the wells were not completed and or producing at year end. Front Runner is currently projected to produce first oil in the second half of 2004. In addition, 73% of oil reserves in Block SK 309 in Malaysia are undeveloped, pending further development drilling in future years. On a worldwide basis, the Company has spent approximately $280 million in 2003, $239 million in 2002 and $208 million in 2001 to develop proved reserves. The Company expects to spend about $220 million in 2004, $118 million in 2005 and $66 million in 2006 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has obtained information from Murphy and other oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to assess how the industry is determining proved reserves related to new field discoveries. SEC regulations allow oil companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test or a conclusive formation test. In the absence of a production test, compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of the oil or natural gas field. Production tests in deepwater environments are extremely expensive and the oil industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility. Murphy has recorded proved reserves related to four deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests. At the end of 2003, proved reserves for these four fields totaled 89.2 million barrels of oil equivalent, or approximately 21% of the Companys worldwide proved reserves, including synthetic oil. Two of the fields are currently partially on production and the third is being developed, with expected first production for the latter field in the second half of 2004. Murphy believes the proved reserves are properly classified. Murphy has furnished the information requested by the SEC and is unable to predict the outcome of the SECs staff review of the industrys practices. This issue is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial results. If the issue is not favorably resolved, the Company may be required to revise the manner in which it reports its proved reserves, which could affect its finding costs per barrel and reserve replacement ratios. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing operations lost $11.2 million in 2003 and $39.9 million in 2002. Earnings from this business were a record $153.7 million in 2001, including gains on asset sales. The 2003 loss from refining and marketing operations was lower than the 2002 loss by $28.7 million primarily due to better margins from the gasoline retail business in North America and the refining and marketing business in the United Kingdom. Overall, the Companys U.S. refining margins continued to be squeezed in 2003, primarily due to the high price of crude oil that the Company was not able to completely pass on to wholesale and other refinery customers. In addition to higher average fuel margins in 2003 at North American retail gasoline stations, the Companys profits from merchandise sales at these gasoline stations were also better in 2003. During 2002, the unfavorable refining and marketing results were generally due to two reasons extremely weak refining margins throughout most of the year in both the United States and United Kingdom, and a $71 million gain in 2001 on sale of the Companys former Canadian pipeline and trucking operations. Crude oil feedstock prices at the Companys U.S. and U.K. refineries were higher in 2002 than in 2001 and the increase in wholesale and retail sales prices for refined products in 2002 did not match the increased costs of crude oil in the markets served by the Company. Prior to the sale of the Canadian operations, this business generated a profit of $3.8 million in 2001. 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Geographically, the North American refining and marketing operations lost $21.2 million in 2003 and $39.2 million in 2002, following a profit of $139.6 million in 2001, which included the $71 million gain on sale of Canadian assets. North American operations include refining activities in the United States and marketing activities in the United States and Canada. It also formerly included pipeline and trucking operations in Canada prior to the sale of this business in 2001. Operations in the U.K. generated a profit of $10 million in 2003, but lost $.7 million in 2002. This business earned $14.1 million in 2001. Unit margins (sales realizations less costs of crude oil, other feedstocks, refining operating expenses and depreciation and transportation to point of sale) averaged $1.60 per barrel in North America in 2003, $.80 in 2002 and $3.12 in 2001. North American product sales volumes increased 30% to a record 229,876 barrels per day in 2003. Sales volumes through the Companys retail gasoline network at Wal Mart stores continued to grow steadily throughout 2003. The Companys North American refined product sales volume of 176,427 barrels per day in 2002 was 1% higher than in 2001. Higher sales volumes by the retail gasoline network in 2002 compared to 2001 were mostly offset by lower sales volumes in the wholesale market caused by lower finished products produced by the Companys U.S. refineries. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $2.86 per barrel in 2003, $1.70 per barrel in 2002 and $3.29 in 2001. Sales of petroleum products were up 2% in 2003 following a 10% increase in 2002. Both years increases were caused by higher volumes sold in the cargo market. U.S. refining and marketing operations were experiencing losses in early 2004 due to continued weak unit margins during this period. Based on sales volumes for 2003 and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $.42 per barrel ($.01 per gallon) fluctuation in the unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by $25.6 million. The effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the Companys exploration and production segments could be affected differently. Corporate The costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $13.8 million in 2003, $23.6 million in 2002 and $12.8 million in 2001. Net after tax corporate costs were $9.8 million lower in 2003 mainly due to a $20.1 million benefit from settlement of previous years income tax audit issues and lower net interest expense. These cost savings were partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses, including costs related to the Companys retirement and incentive compensation plans. The higher net cost of $10.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to a combination of more net interest expense associated with higher borrowings and lower interest income earned. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 10 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures, including discretionary exploration expenditures, were $979.2 million in 2003 compared to $868.1 million in 2002 and $864.4 million in 2001. These amounts included $123.9 million, $134.8 million and $133.8 million of exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled $762.7 million in 2003, 78% of the Companys total capital expenditures for the year. Exploration and production capital expenditures in 2003 included $24.4 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, $196.7 million for exploration activities, and $541.6 million for development projects. Development expenditures included $185.4 million for development of deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico; $111.2 million for the West Patricia and Kikeh fields in Malaysia; $28.3 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland; $93.8 million for expansion of synthetic oil operations at the Syncrude project in Canada; and $62.5 million for Western Canada projects. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $215.4 million in 2003, compared to $234.7 million in 2002 and $175.2 million in 2001. These amounts represented 22%, 27% and 20% of total capital expenditures of the Company in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Refining capital spending was $130.8 million in 2003, compared to $150.1 million in 2002 and $88.9 million in 2001. The Company completed in 2003 its expansion of the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, which included building a hydrocracker unit to meet future clean fuel specifications and expanding the crude oil processing capacity of the plant to 125,000 barrels per day. Capital expenditures related to this expansion project amounted to $69 million in 2003, $116.2 million in 2002 and $55.1 million in 2001. Marketing expenditures amounted to $84.6 million in 2003 and 2002, and $86.3 million in 2001. The majority of marketing expenditures in each year was related to construction of retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart sites in 21 states in the U.S. The Company began building gasoline stations at Wal Mart stores in Canada in 2002. The Company opened 119 total stations in the U.S. and Canada in 2003, 125 in 2002 and 111 in 2001. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash Flows Cash provided by continuing operations was $652.3 million in 2003, $527 million in 2002 and $630.6 million in 2001. The increase in cash provided in 2003 was primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product sales volumes, and higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $66.5 million in 2003, $15.2 million in 2002 and $16.4 million in 2001. Scheduled plant wide turnarounds occurred at both U.S. refineries in 2003. Cash proceeds from property sales were $188.6 million in 2003, $68.1 million in 2002 and $173 million in 2001. The 2003 property sales included the disposal of the Ninian and Columba fields in the U.K. and various oil and gas assets in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Borrowings under notes payable and other long term debt, which were primarily used to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures, provided $309.7 million of cash in 2003, $407.6 million in 2002 and $88.2 million in 2001. Additional borrowings were lower in 2003 than in 2002 because of higher operational cash flow and higher proceeds from asset sales in the latter year. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans amounted to $3.6 million in 2003, $25.1 million in 2002 and $18.9 million in 2001. Property additions and dry hole costs required $937.8 million of cash in 2003, $834.1 million in 2002 and $810.2 million in 2001. More field development expenditures in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and at the West Patricia and Kikeh fields in Malaysia mostly accounted for the 2003 increase. Cash outlays for debt repayment during the three years included $76.8 million in 2003, $57.8 million in 2002 and $77.7 million in 2001. Larger debt repayments in 2003 were related to nonrecourse debt associated with the Companys Hibernia field. Certain of the nonrecourse debt was repaid using available free cash flow as required by the nonrecourse debt agreement at Hibernia. Free cash flow increased due to a higher average sales price and higher production levels in 2003. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $73.5 million in 2003, $70.9 million in 2002 and $67.8 million in 2001. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $.75 per share to $.80 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2002. Financial Condition Year end working capital totaled $228.5 million in 2003, $136.3 million in 2002 and $38.6 million in 2001. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying values for inventories under last in first out accounting were $156 million below fair value at December 31, 2003. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2003 totaled $252.4 million compared to $165 million a year ago and $82.7 million at the end of 2001. Long term debt increased by $227.5 million during 2003 to $1.09 billion at the end of the year, 35.5% of total capital employed. Long term debt included $28.9 million of nonrecourse debt incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of the Hibernia oil field. The increase in long term debt in 2003 was attributable to new borrowings associated with the Companys capital expenditure program, including deepwater Gulf of Mexico development projects, continued expansion of the Syncrude plant, development of fields in Malaysia, and an expansion project at the Companys Meraux, Louisiana refinery that was completed by year end 2003. Long term debt totaled $862.8 million at the end of 2002 compared to $520.8 million at December 31, 2001. Stockholders equity was $1.95 billion at the end of 2003 compared to $1.59 billion a year ago and $1.5 billion at the end of 2001. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 5 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy had commitments of $456.4 million for capital projects in progress at December 31, 2003, including $38.9 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, $84.2 million for continued expansion of synthetic oil operations in Canada, and $117.4 million for future work commitments in Malaysia. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company typically relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2003, the Company had access to short term and long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of $700 million. Of this amount, $150 million of revolving facilities had been drawn at year end 2003. The most restrictive covenants under these facilities limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. At December 31, 2003, the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 36%. The Company also has unused uncommitted credit lines of approximately $94 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company has a shelf 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements registration on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of up to $650 million in debt and equity securities. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note E to the consolidated financial statements. At present, the Company does not anticipate utilizing a significant amount of its long term borrowing capacity in 2004 as proceeds from the intended sale of Western Canada assets and normal cash flow from operations are expected to essentially cover the Companys capital expenditure program. At March 1, 2004 the Companys long term debt rating by Standard and Poors was A and by Moodys was Baal. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.8 to 1 in 2003, 3.2 to 1 in 2002 and 11.3 to 1 in 2001. Environmental Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the Companys operations are: The Clean Air Act, as amended The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Safe Drinking Water Act Regulations of the United States Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations These acts and their associated regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. Many states also have similar statutes and regulations governing air and water, which in some cases impose additional and more stringent requirements. Murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills. The applicable acts are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), commonly referred to as Superfund, and comparable state statutes. CERCLA primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites. As discussed below, Murphy is involved in a limited number of Superfund sites. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and comparable state statutes, govern the management and disposal of wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owners property. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, under which owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. Pursuant to the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used. Pursuant to state laws corresponding to the CAA, several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the Companys operations. The Company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities, including three refineries, five terminals, and approximately 82 service stations, for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist. In addition the Company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation. Under the Companys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. The Companys liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. If regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, future expenditures could exceed the accrued liability by up to an estimated $3 million. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently considers the Company to be a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at two Superfund sites. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. Based on currently available information, the Company has reason to believe that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at both Superfund sites. The Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other Superfund sites. The Company does not believe that the ultimate costs to clean up the two Superfund sites will have a material adverse effect on its net income or cash flows in a future period. There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites. However, based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on future net income or cash flows. Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at December 31, 2003. The Companys refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils; laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and various industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to $3.5 million in 2003. In addition to these expenses, Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Such capital expenditures were approximately $140.9 million in 2003 and are projected to be $65.7 million in 2004. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Because crude oil and natural gas sales prices were strong during 2003 and early 2004, prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected in the future. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements As described in Note B on page F 10 of this Form 10 K report, Murphy adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, effective January 1, 2001 and SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Company recorded an after tax charge of $7 million, which was reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Adoption of SFAS Nos. 133/138 resulted in a transition adjustment gain to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $6.6 million, net of $2.8 million in income taxes, for the cumulative effect on prior years; there was no cumulative effect on earnings. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, and SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 145 amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary and also amends SFAS No. 13 to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. The adoption of these two accounting standards did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additionally, beginning January 1, 2003, the Company has applied Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirement for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34, and FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51. Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued and requires under certain circumstances a guarantor to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. Interpretation No. 46 addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the Interpretation. FASB Interpretation No. 46 was revised in December 2003 to provide further guidance about consolidation of variable interest entities. Application of this revised interpretation is effective for year end 2003 for entities considered to be special purpose entities as defined, or otherwise beginning in 2004 for other entities subject to the revised interpretation. The application of these FASB Interpretations did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. The annual disclosures are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with all provisions applied prospectively. The Companys adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify an instrument that is within its scope as a liability. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact on the Companys financial statements as the Company had no financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations after July 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized and reported as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires that amortization of goodwill be replaced with annual tests for impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives. The Company adopted SFAS No. 141 upon its issuance and adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company had goodwill of $64.9 million at December 31, 2003. Goodwill has been tested for impairment as required by SFAS No. 142 at year end 2003. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The Company adopted the provision of SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no impact on the Companys financial statements. The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic 02 3 in the fourth quarter 2002. This consensus required that gains and losses on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133 be shown net in the income statement if the derivatives are held for trading purposes. Accordingly, Murphy reflected the results of its crude oil trading activities as net revenue in its income statement and previously reported revenues and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts with no changes to net income or cash flows. The effect of this reclassification was a net reduction of both Sales and Other Operating Revenues and Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Product Purchases by approximately $269 million in 2002 and $600 million in 2001. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In July 2003 the FASB undertook to review whether mineral interests in properties (mineral leases) held by oil and gas companies should be recorded and disclosed as intangible assets under the guidance of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The FASB is considering whether an oil and gas companys investment in mineral leases should be classified as intangible assets. SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, intangible assets should be separately reported on the Balance Sheet, with accompanying disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. SFAS No. 142 does not change the accounting prescribed in SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, and is silent about whether its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies. The Company does not believe that SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 change the classification and disclosure of oil and gas mineral leases and it continues to classify these assets as part of Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and it does not provide the additional disclosures for these assets. The EITF has added the discussion of oil and gas mineral leases to its agenda, which may result in a change in the recording and disclosure of oil and gas mineral leases. Should the EITF determine that oil and gas mineral leases are intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, the Company would reclassify $143 million and $142 million as intangible undeveloped mineral interests at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, a reclassification of $8 million and $7 million would be made as intangible developed mineral interests at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Both intangible assets would be presented net of accumulated amortization. Historically, undeveloped mineral leases have been amortized over the life of the lease period, while developed mineral leases have been amortized using the units of production method over the expected life of proved reserves. The amounts included herein are based on our understanding of the issue on the EITFs agenda. If all mineral leases associated with oil and gas properties are deemed to be intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 by the EITF: These assets would not be included in Property, Plant and Equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheet We do not believe that our net income or cash flows from operations would be materially affected because the amortization of these assets would not be different than the method currently used by the Company Disclosures required by SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 relative to intangible assets would be included in the notes to the financial statements Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies are described below. Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the Company. The Company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. (See page 17 regarding the SECs review of the oil and gas industrys recognition of proved reserves.) Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. Costs of exploration wells in progress at year end 2003 were not significant. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. The Company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other basis differences in Ecuador and Malaysia. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for certain deferred tax assets related to Ecuador and Malaysia due to managements belief that these assets are not likely to be realized. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long term liabilities. Total payments due after 2003 under such contractual obligations are shown below. Amount of Obligation (Millions of dollars) Total 2004 2005 2007 2008 2009 After 2009 Long term debt $ 1,157.5 67.2 486.4 6.4 597.5 Operating leases 104.5 16.6 44.3 23.4 20.2 Purchase obligations 658.4 388.8 146.5 55.7 67.4 Other long term liabilities 305.7 20.1 23.5 46.5 215.6 Total $ 2,226.1 492.7 700.7 132.0 900.7 In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments that expire in future periods is shown below. Amount of Commitment (Millions of dollars) Total 2004 2005 2007 2008 2009 After 2009 Financial guarantees $ 9.0 .5 2.6 5.9 Letters of credit 36.4 20.7 6.4 9.3 Total $ 45.4 21.2 6.4 11.9 5.9 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2003 involve an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract. The processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the Medusa field in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the contract, the Company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility. If actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through 2009 is less than a specified quantity, the Company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time. The Company has committed to purchase hydrogen for the Meraux refinery from a third party through 2019. The contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased. Payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid. Future required minimum annual payments under both of these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above. Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. During 2003 and early 2004 crude oil prices remained strong primarily due to uncertainty in Iraq and the Middle East, coupled with an improving global economy and effective price management practices utilized by OPEC. High crude oil prices were a contributing factor to weak earnings and cash flows from the Companys refining and marketing operations. Natural gas prices also were strong in 2003 and early 2004, mainly due to demand for the product often outstripping supply in the short term. Due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil prices and U.S. natural gas prices constant reassessment of spending plans is required. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2004 was prepared during the fall of 2003 and provides for capital expenditures of $843 million. Of this amount, $650 million or 77%, is allocated for exploration and production. Geographically, 29% of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the United States, including $84 million for development of deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico; another 28% is allocated to Canada, including $32 million for continued development of the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields and $75 million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations; 37% is allocated to exploration and development in Malaysia; and the remaining 6% is planned for other areas, including Ecuador, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Congo. Budgeted refining and marketing capital expenditures for 2004 are $184 million, including $165 million in North America and $19 million in the United Kingdom. Planned spending in North America includes funds to build 160 additional gasoline stations at Wal Mart sites. Capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during 2004. In late 2003, the Company announced its intent to sell most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in Western Canada. The properties expected to be sold produce approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Marketing of the properties to be sold began in February, and the sale is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2004. The gain or loss on the sale and the operating results of the properties to be sold are expected to be accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in 2004. The Company currently does not anticipate a significant increase in long term borrowings between year ends 2003 and 2004. Although Murphys 2004 Budget includes a robust amount of capital spending, the Company expects the proceeds of the sale of Western Canada conventional oil and gas properties and normal operating cash flows to be sufficient to cover planned spending. It is possible that long term debt could exceed the budgeted year end 2004 levels, especially if the sales proceeds in Western Canada are less than anticipated or if cash flows are adversely affected in the upcoming months by significantly weaker oil and natural gas sales prices and continued weak refining and marketing margins such as those experienced in early 2004. The Company has made significant oil discoveries in deep waters off Sabah, Malaysia. The Company is currently preparing a plan of development and considering its alternatives for funding the project. Although it is too early to predict the ultimate cost of the development project, it is likely that a significant portion of the Companys share of funding will come from borrowed capital. Significant development costs are currently expected to begin in 2005. First production from the deepwater fields offshore Sabah is estimated to occur in 2007. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Murphys oil production is expected to grow in 2004. The Medusa and Habanero fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico started up November 2003 and the West Patricia field in Malaysia came on line in May 2003. Production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields will ramp up in early 2004. Another deepwater Gulf of Mexico field known as Front Runner is expected to come on production in the second half of 2004. These new fields are expected to more than offset normal production declines and the expected sale of Western Canada properties. Natural gas sales volumes are expected to decline in 2004 compared to 2003 levels. Total production for 2004 is projected to average approximately 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. During 2003, the Company reduced the expected investment return for assets held in its U.S. retirement plans from 8.0% to 7.5%. Due to a reduction in bond yields during 2003, the Company has also reduced the plans discount rates from 6.75% in 2003 to 6.25% in 2004. The funded status of the Companys retirement plans was adversely affected over the last two years by changes in assumptions used to calculate plan liabilities. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tend to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns. The effect of liability assumption changes will adversely impact the Companys pension expense in 2004. The Companys annual retirement plan expense is estimated to increase by about $2.5 million for 2004 compared to 2003. In 2004, the Company is required to fund payments of approximately $2.5 million into two funded retirement plans and expects to pay $1.1 million for two unfunded plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K report, including documents incorporated by reference here, contains statements of the Companys expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the Companys control. These forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the Companys January 15, 1997 Form 8 K report on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. The Company was a party to interest rate swaps at December 31, 2003 with notional amounts totaling $50 million that were designed to hedge fluctuations in cash flows of a similar amount of variable rate debt. These swaps mature in 2004. The swaps require the Company to pay an average interest rate of 6.17% over their composite lives, and at December 31, 2003, the interest rate to be received by the Company averaged 1.64%. The variable interest rate received by the Company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly. The Company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates. The estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was recorded as a liability of $1.8 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, 40% of the Companys debt had variable interest rates and 2% was denominated in Canadian dollars. Based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2003, a 10% increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase the Companys interest expense in 2004 by approximately $3.4 million after including the favorable effect resulting from lower net settlement payments under the aforementioned interest rate swaps. A 10% increase in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would increase interest expense in 2004 by less than $.1 million for debt denominated in Canadian dollars. Murphy was a party to natural gas swap agreements at December 31, 2003 for a total notional volume of 9.2 MMBTU that were originally designated as a hedge of the financial exposure of its Meraux, Louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the future price of a portion of natural gas to be purchased for fuel during 2004 through 2006. In each month of settlement, the swaps require Murphy to pay an average natural gas price of $2.78 per MMBTU and to receive the average NYMEX price for the final three trading days of the month. At December 31, 2003, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of $22.8 million. A 10% increase in the average NYMEX price of natural gas would have increased this asset by $4.7 million, while a 10% decrease would have reduced the asset by a similar amount. As described in Note J on Page F 24, at December 31, 2003, a portion of these agreements no longer qualified for hedge accounting and a portion of these agreements have been redesignated as a hedge of natural gas to be purchased by the Superior refinery in 2004. Murphy is subject to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily because of its operations in Canada and the U.K. Fluctuations in foreign currencies affect reported revenues and operating costs, capital expenditures and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. On occasion, the Company has used financial currency contracts to manage this risk. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $33 million in Canadian dollar forward contracts that matured within 30 days. The fair value of these contracts was recorded in income at the end of 2003 and did not significantly impact the Companys financial statements.
