Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in North America and the United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue primarily by selling its oil and natural gas production and its refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and other countries. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in North America that are primarily located at Wal Mart Supercenters, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys downstream operations are dependent upon achieving adequate refining and marketing margins, which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions. Worldwide oil prices and North American natural gas prices were stronger in 2005 than in 2004. The average price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in 2005 was $56.70, an increase of 37% compared to 2004. The NYMEX natural gas price in 2005 averaged $8.97 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU), up 45% over 2004. These price improvements, particularly for crude oil, were a significant factor leading to higher profits in the Companys exploration and production business in 2005 compared to 2004. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in 2006 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. Results of Operations The Company had net income in 2005 of $846.5 million, $4.51 per diluted share, compared to net income in 2004 of $701.3 million, $3.75 per diluted share. In 2003 the Companys net income was $294.2 million, $1.59 per diluted share. The higher net income in 2005 compared to 2004 was caused by a combination of better earnings in the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing operations and lower net costs for corporate functions. The larger net income in 2004 compared to 2003 was also caused by better earnings in the exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses, but was unfavorably affected by higher net costs of corporate activities. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. Income from continuing operations was $837.9 million, $4.46 per diluted share, in 2005, $496.4 million, $2.65 per diluted share, in 2004, and $278.4 million, $1.50 per diluted share, in 2003. Each of the three years ended December 31, 2005 included income from discontinued operations. In the second quarter 2004 the Company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in western Canada for cash proceeds of $583 million, which generated an after tax gain on the sale of $171.1 million in 2004. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the gain on sale of these assets and operating results for the fields prior to their sale have been presented, net of income tax expense, as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated statements of income for the three year period ended December 31, 2005. Income from discontinued operations was $8.6 million, $.05 per diluted share, in 2005, $204.9 million, $1.10 per diluted share, in 2004, and $22.8 million, $.12 per diluted share, in 2003. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 related to a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale of the western Canada properties in 2004. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Company recorded an expense of $7 million, net of $1.4 million in income taxes, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Further explanation of this accounting change is included in Note G to the consolidated financial statements. Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $301.2 million, $1.62 per diluted share, in 2003. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income in 2005 was $846.5 million, $4.51 per share, compared to $701.3 million, $3.75 per share, in 2004. Income from continuing operations amounted to $837.9 million, $4.46 per share, in 2005 compared to $496.4 million, $2.65 per share, in 2004. The $341.5 million improvement in income from continuing operations in 2005 was caused by more favorable results in each of the Companys exploration and production (E&P), refining and marketing (R&M) and corporate activities. Higher sales prices in 2005 for the Companys oil and natural gas production was the primary driver for improved earnings of $235.8 million in the E&P business. The other favorable factors in this business in 2005 were higher oil 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sales volumes and a larger gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties. The Companys E&P earnings were unfavorably affected in 2005 by several factors, including higher insurance costs mostly caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, lower sales volumes for natural gas due to both the sale of properties in the Gulf of Mexico and downtime caused by the hurricanes, higher exploration expenses, lower income tax benefits and rising costs of supplies and services. R&M earnings were $125.3 million in 2005, up $43.4 million compared to 2004 due to stronger realized margins for petroleum products sold in the U.S. and U.K. The Company expanded its retail fuel operations in each of these countries in 2005 by adding 112 retail fuel outlets at Wal Mart Supercenters in the U.S. and by purchasing 68 existing retail fuel stations in the U.K. The net costs of corporate activities were $62.3 million lower in 2005 than in 2004, with the favorable variance in 2005 mostly due to a combination of higher tax benefits associated with refund and settlement of prior year U.S. taxes, lower Canadian withholding taxes on dividends to Murphy Oil Corporation from its Canadian subsidiary, favorable effects from foreign currency exchange, and less net interest costs due to lower average borrowings and the capitalization of more interest costs on development projects in the E&P business. These were partially offset by higher selling and general expenses in 2005, with the majority of this increase caused by larger employee compensation and benefit costs. The Company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas assets in western Canada in 2004, and net income in 2005 and 2004 included income from these discontinued operations of $8.6 million and $204.9 million, respectively, which represented per share earnings of $.05 in 2005 and $1.10 in 2004. Discontinued operations income in 2005 arose from a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale in 2004. In 2004, cash proceeds of $583 million from the sale led to an after tax gain of $171.1 million, which is included in the 2004 amount above. Sales and other operating revenues in 2005 were $3.4 billion higher than in 2004 primarily due to higher sales prices for oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, higher sales volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products, and higher merchandise sales revenue at retail gasoline stations. Sales were unfavorably affected in 2005 by lower volumes of natural gas sold. The gain on sale of assets was $105.5 million higher in 2005, mostly due to a pretax gain of $165 million on the sale of oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf in 2005, partially offset by pretax profits in 2004 on sale of various properties. Interest and other income was favorable by $30.8 million in 2005 compared to 2004 mostly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses in 2004 that did not repeat in 2005 and higher interest income on a U.S. income tax refund in 2005. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $2.6 billion in 2005 due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks and higher prices for refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations. Operating expenses increased $112.6 million in 2005 due mostly to costs associated with more crude oil production and more retail service stations in operations in the U.S. and U.K. Exploration expenses in the E&P business were $68.2 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 mostly due to more dry holes in Malaysia and the Republic of Congo, plus more spending on 3 D seismic acquisition and processing in Malaysia in 2005. Costs associated with hurricanes in 2005 of $66.8 million related to additional insurance, repairs and other costs that arose due to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the year. These storms, which damaged and led to temporary shut down of certain offshore U.S. oil and gas facilities and the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, led to uninsured repair costs of about $15.5 million in 2005 and caused insurance costs for the year to rise by approximately $23.0 million. Also included in this cost category is $19.5 million of ongoing Meraux refinery salaries, benefits, depreciation and maintenance costs while the refinery is shut down for repairs, and also donations and additional employee compensation totaling $8.8 million. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the increase in certain insurance costs related to the storm losses incurred by insurance companies has been allocated to all segments of the Companys business as all assets are covered by this property insurance. Costs associated with hurricanes were $3.4 million in 2004, and were previously included in operating expenses in the 2004 consolidated statement of income in the 2004 Form 10 K. Selling and general expenses were $26.6 million more in 2005 mostly due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $75.4 million higher in 2005 due to more volumes of crude oil sold and more fueling stations operating in the U.S. and U.K. The Company is experiencing higher drilling and other capital costs, which appear to be caused by added demand for such services due to the higher level of oil and natural gas sales prices. Accretion of asset retirement obligations was down $.3 million in 2005 due to sales of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. Interest expense was down by $8.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to lower average outstanding debt in 2005. The portion of interest expense capitalized to development projects rose by $16.4 million in 2005 primarily due to higher interest allocated to the Kikeh development in Malaysia and the Syncrude expansion in western Canada. Income tax expense was up $225.6 million in 2005 mostly due to higher pretax earnings. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of pretax income in 2005 of 38.9% was unfavorably impacted by no tax benefits recognized on exploration expenses incurred in the Republic of Congo and Blocks PM 311/312 and H in Malaysia, but was favorably affected by income tax benefits of $21.8 million mostly related to refund and settlement of prior year U.S. income tax matters. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income in 2004 was $701.3 million, $3.75 per share, compared to $294.2 million, $1.59 per share, in 2003. Both periods included income from discontinued operations associated with conventional oil and natural gas properties in western Canada that were sold in the second quarter 2004. Income from discontinued operations amounted to $204.9 million in 2004 and $22.8 million in 2003, $1.10 and $.12 per share, respectively. The 2004 amount included a $171.1 million gain net of taxes associated with the sale. The Company received proceeds of $583 million from the sale. The 2003 period included an after tax expense of $7 million, $.03 per share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Income from continuing operations totaled $496.4 million, $2.65 per share, in 2004 compared to $278.4 million, $1.50 per share, in 2003. The $218 million improvement in income from continuing operations in 2004 was due to a combination of higher earnings from the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing operating businesses. Higher net costs of corporate activities partially offset the better results from these operating businesses. E&P operating results improved $208.9 million mostly due to higher oil and natural gas sales prices, higher oil sales volumes, and a $31.9 million deferred income tax benefit in Malaysia due to the expectation that temporary differences associated with exploration and other 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements costs incurred to date in Block K will be utilized to reduce future taxable income. The E&P results were unfavorably affected in 2004 by higher exploration expenses and lower natural gas sales volumes compared to 2003. R&M operating results improved by $93.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to much stronger realized margins on refined petroleum products sold by the U.S. and U.K. businesses. The net costs of corporate activities were $84 million higher in 2004 because of a 5% withholding tax on a $550 million dividend to Murphy Oil Corporation from the Companys Canadian subsidiary, unfavorable foreign exchange variances in 2004, a $20.1 million tax benefit in 2003 related to settlement of U.S. tax matters, lower capitalized interest costs in 2004 due to the completion of significant E&P development projects, and higher administrative expenses in 2004 related mostly to Sarbanes Oxley compliance and retirement plans. The Canadian withholding tax in 2004 amounted to $27.5 million of costs. Foreign exchange losses were $18.6 million after taxes in 2004 compared to an after tax benefit of $5.4 million in 2003. These 2004 losses were primarily associated with U.S. dollar balances of cash and other net assets held by the Companys Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, which generally use local currency as their functional currency for accounting purposes. Sales and other operating revenues in 2004 increased $3.2 billion compared to 2003 mostly due to higher prices for oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products sold, higher sales volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products, and higher merchandise sales revenue at retail gasoline stations. Gain on sale of assets increased by $8.1 million in 2004 due to a higher profit on sales of E&P properties in the year compared to 2003. Interest and other income was unfavorable by $17.5 million in 2004 versus 2003 mostly because of pretax foreign exchange losses of $26.6 million in 2004 compared to gains of $5.6 million in 2003; the foreign exchange effects were partially offset by higher interest income earned on invested cash balances during 2004. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $2.5 billion in 2004 due to the higher prices for crude oil purchased as refinery feedstocks and refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations, and higher purchased volumes of crude oil, refined petroleum products and merchandise for resale compared to 2003. Operating expenses increased $153.9 million in 2004 with the change due to higher lifting costs caused by crude oil production growth and higher unit rates, higher refining and gasoline station expenses, and higher insurance and repair costs caused mostly by storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration expenses rose by $51.6 million in 2004 mostly due to higher dry hole costs offshore eastern Canada and in Malaysia. Selling and general expenses were $12.8 million higher in the current year and increased due to consulting fees associated with Sarbanes Oxley compliance, plus increases for salaries, retirement and other benefits, and incentive compensation. Depreciation, depletion and amortization rose by $62.6 million mostly due to higher production of crude oil and higher depreciation of refining and marketing assets. Property impairments of $8.3 million in 2003 related to write down of a refined products terminal closed by the company, write off of certain property costs that were rendered obsolete at the Meraux refinery and the write down of a natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico due to downward revisions in reserves caused by poor well performance. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by $.3 million, mostly due to drilling wells and facilities added during 2004. Interest expense was $1.5 million less than in 2003 mostly due to lower average debt outstanding during 2004. Capitalized interest credited to income and included in capital expenditures decreased by $15.1 million due to completion of the Medusa development project in the Gulf of Mexico and the expansion project at the Meraux refinery. Income tax expense was $212.7 million higher in 2004 than 2003 mostly due to higher pretax income, but also because of a $20.1 million benefit in 2003 from settlement of prior year U.S. tax audits. Income tax expense in 2004 included a $31.9 million benefit in Malaysia related to expected future tax deductions for life to date exploration and other expenses in Block K, but this was mostly offset by a $27.5 million charge for a 5% withholding tax on a dividend from a Canadian subsidiary. In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2005 are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Exploration and production United States $ 385.5 159.5 23.3 Canada 308.2 232.2 166.2 United Kingdom 79.9 87.1 95.3 Ecuador 38.1 6.6 16.7 Malaysia (4.7 ) 38.3 10.7 Other (58.9 ) (11.4 ) (8.8 ) 748.1 512.3 303.4 Refining and marketing North America 85.5 53.4 (21.2 ) United Kingdom 39.8 28.5 10.0 125.3 81.9 (11.2 ) Corporate and other (35.5 ) (97.8 ) (13.8 ) Income from continuing operations 837.9 496.4 278.4 Income from discontinued operations 8.6 204.9 22.8 Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 846.5 701.3 301.2 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (7.0 ) Net income $ 846.5 701.3 294.2 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production operations were $748.1 million in 2005, $512.3 million in 2004 and $303.4 million in 2003. The higher earnings in 2005 versus 2004 were due to a 26% higher average realized oil sales price, a 33% higher average realized sales price for natural gas in North America, a 16% increase in worldwide oil sales volumes from continuing operations, and higher gains on sale of mature properties. The favorable variances were somewhat offset by an 18% lower volume of natural gas sales from continuing operations, higher exploration expenses, higher production and depreciation expenses, higher insurance and repair costs after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and lower income tax benefits in Malaysia. The 2005 period included a $104.5 million after tax gain on sale of most oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil production in 2005 was primarily caused by a full year of production at the Front Runner field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and higher heavy oil production from the Seal area in western Canada in response to an ongoing development drilling program. Natural gas sales volume declined in 2005 versus 2004 mostly due to the sale of properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and more downtime in the Gulf of Mexico caused by hurricane shut in and repairs. The increase in 2004 earnings compared to 2003 was due to a 37% higher average realized oil sales price, a 24% higher realized sales price for North American natural gas, a 17% higher sales volume of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, a $31.9 million deferred income tax benefit on inception to date Block K exploration and other expenses, and lower impairment charges. These favorable variances more than offset lower volumes of natural gas production, higher production and depreciation expenses associated with increased oil production, higher exploration expenses caused by more dry hole costs offshore eastern Canada and in Malaysia, higher insurance costs related to a retrospective premium adjustment on property insurance coverage and higher costs to repair damages to facilities caused by Hurricane Ivan. Higher oil production in 2004 was attributable to a full year of production in 2004 at Medusa and Habanero in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and at West Patricia in Block SK 309 in Malaysia. The decline in natural gas production in 2004 was due to field decline at Amethyst in the U.K. North Sea and downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for repairs after Hurricane Ivan. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 36 and F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 6 of the 2005 Annual Report. A summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 448.8 248.4 39.2 Natural gas 216.6 207.6 158.3 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 519.7 403.3 314.8 Natural gas 29.7 28.7 34.9 Synthetic oil 224.7 174.2 95.7 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 159.8 146.8 158.6 Natural gas 19.9 11.4 12.2 Malaysia crude oil 232.9 167.2 77.7 Ecuador crude oil 116.6 30.8 41.9 Total oil and gas revenues $ 1,968.7 1,418.4 933.3 The Companys crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged 101,349 barrels per day in 2005, 93,634 barrels per day in 2004 and 76,620 barrels in 2003. Oil production in 2005 was a new annual record for Murphy Oil. The 8% increase in worldwide oil production in 2005 was primarily due to higher volumes in the United States, Malaysia and Canada. U.S. oil production was 34% higher in 2005 and totaled 25,897 barrels per day, with the increase mostly due to a full year of production from the Front Runner field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Green Canyon Blocks 338/339. The first well at Front Runner came on stream in December 2004 and additional wells were completed and started up during 2005 and into early 2006. Production in the U.S. was hampered during 2005 by the effects of hurricanes as minor damages to the Companys Medusa and Habanero facilities and damages to product evacuation lines and other facilities downstream caused shut in of production for up to three months. Production offshore Sarawak, Malaysia at the West Patricia and Congkak fields increased 14% in 2005 to 13,503 barrels per day. The increase was mostly due to a 31% increase in gross production from these fields, but this was partially offset by a lower revenue sharing percentage for the Company under the terms of the production sharing contract. The West Patricia field generated approximately 94% of Malaysian production in 2005. Heavy oil production in Canada essentially doubled to 11,806 barrels per day in 2005 due to an ongoing development drilling program in the Seal area and a full year of production from wells acquired in late 2004 in this area. Production at the Hibernia field off the east coast of Canada was down 4% to 12,278 barrels per day and production at the Terra Nova field in this area was off 14% in 2005 and amounted to 10,846 barrels per day. Lower production at Terra Nova was primarily caused by more downtime for equipment maintenance and repairs and a higher royalty rate. Production of synthetic oil at Syncrude netted the Company 10,593 barrels per day in 2005, down 10% from 2004 due to more downtime for equipment repairs. Total oil production offshore the United Kingdom was 7,992 barrels per day in 2005, down 27%. About 1,200 barrels per day of this decline was 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements attributable to the sale of the T Block field in 2004. The majority of the remaining decline was at the Schiehallion field where a fire and other operational issues reduced average net production volumes by about 1,600 barrels per day. Production in Ecuador was 7,871 barrels per day in 2005, up 2% from 2004. Oil sales volumes in Ecuador in 2005 were significantly higher than production volumes due to receiving 663,000 barrels of oil for sale in settlement of a 2004 dispute with the operator of Block 16. Murphy expects to make up the remainder of the sales volume shortfall of about 853,000 barrels owed to the Company by other Block 16 owners in 2006. Comparing 2004 to 2003, worldwide oil production from continuing operations increased 22%, primarily attributable to production growth in the U.S. and Malaysia. Oil production in Canada and the U.K. declined in 2004 compared to 2003. U.S. oil production increased more than 300% to 19,314 barrels per day due to a full year of production in 2004 from the Medusa and Habanero fields. Both these deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields came on stream in November 2003. Heavy oil production in Canada increased 24% to 5,838 barrels per day due to a heavy oil drilling program in the Seal area during 2004, plus additional producing wells acquired in this area during the fourth quarter of 2004. Production at the Hibernia field off the east coast of Canada was essentially flat with 2003 at 12,736 barrels per day, but the Terra Nova field saw production decrease 19% to 12,671 barrels per day, with the decline mostly due to mechanical problems and an oil spill that occurred during the year. Net synthetic oil production from the Syncrude project was 11,794 barrels per day, a 13% increase from 2003. The increase at Syncrude was in line with higher gross production, which was caused by better operational efficiency and less downtime in 2004 compared to 2003. Oil production in the U.K. was lower by 25% and averaged 11,011 barrels per day. The Company sold its interest in the T Block field in 2004 and the Ninian and Columba fields in 2003. Also, production from the Schiehallion and Mungo/Monan fields was down in 2004 due to normal decline. Production in Ecuador rose almost 50% in 2004 due to a full year of operation for the new heavy oil pipeline. In prior years, production restrictions were in effect due to limitations caused by inadequate pipeline capacity between the primary oil producing region in the countrys interior to the sales point on the Pacific coast. In spite of the higher Ecuadorian production in 2004, total sales volumes in this country in 2004 were lower than 2003 because no sales occurred from Block 16 for the Companys account during the second half of the year due to a dispute with the operator of the field over Murphys new transportation and marketing arrangements. The Company settled this issue with the operator in 2005 as described in the preceding paragraph. Malaysian oil production rose 63% in 2004 and averaged 11,885 barrels per day, caused by a full year of production in the current year from the West Patricia field in Block SK 309 versus a partial year in 2003. Worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were 90.2 million cubic feet per day in 2005, 109.5 million in 2004 and 111.8 million in 2003. Sales of natural gas in the United States were 70.5 million cubic feet per day in 2005, 88.6 million in 2004 and 82.3 million in 2003. Sales volume declined by 21% in the U.S. in 2005 due to the sale of most properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico in mid 2005, which caused a decrease of 14 million cubic feet per day, and the effects of Hurricane Katrina and other Gulf storms that caused shut ins that reduced production by an average of about 15 million cubic feet per day for the year. These were partially offset by higher volumes due to ramp up of production at the Front Runner field throughout 2005. Sales in the U.S. were higher in 2004 than 2003 as more volumes produced during the full production year at the Medusa and Habanero fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico more than offset declines at other more mature fields. Sales volumes in 2004 were unfavorably affected by Hurricane Ivan which temporarily shut in most production in the Central Gulf of Mexico and severely damaged certain facilities, such as at the Tahoe field in Viosca Knoll Block 783, which was shut in for the entire fourth quarter 2004 following the storm. Natural gas sales volumes in Canada were 10.3 million cubic feet per day in 2005, 14 million in 2004 and 19.9 million in 2003. These were annual decreases of 26% in 2005 and 30% in 2004 and were mostly due to normal field decline at Rimbey area wells. Natural gas sales volumes in the United Kingdom in 2005 of 9.4 million cubic feet per day were up 37% with most of the increase due to higher sales volumes at the Amethyst field primarily caused by make up gas sold in 2005 that related to a prior years contract. Natural gas sales in the U.K. were down from 9.6 million cubic feet per day in 2003 to 6.9 million cubic feet in 2004. The 28% decrease in 2004 was due to normal declines at the Amethyst field in the U.K. North Sea. Worldwide crude oil sales prices have risen in each of the last two years due to the combination of a strong world economy, real and perceived instability in worldwide crude oil production levels, and effective production output controls by OPEC producers. Murphy realized an average worldwide crude oil and condensate sales price of $45.25 per barrel in 2005, a 26% increase from the 2004 realized average price of $35.92 per barrel. The 2004 average sales price was 37% higher than the 2003 average price of $26.15 per barrel. The worldwide average price in 2003 was reduced $2.00 per barrel by the effects of the Companys hedging program. The Company had hedged the sales price in 2003 for most of its heavy oil production in Canada and light oil production in the U.S., as well as a portion of its offshore and synthetic crude production in Canada. The average realized price in 2005 for crude oil and condensate sold in the U.S. was $47.48 per barrel, an increase of 34% over 2004. The average price for 2005 Canadian heavy oil sales was $21.30 per barrel, up 5% from 2004, and was adversely affected by higher costs of diluent and a wider heavy oil discount in the year. The average selling price for Hibernia and Terra Nova production offshore eastern Canada was $51.37 per barrel, an increase of 40%. Synthetic oil production sales price rose 44% in 2005 and averaged $58.12 per barrel. Sales prices for U.K. North Sea oil was up 43% to $52.83 per barrel. Ecuador sales prices averaged $32.54 per barrel in 2005 and Malaysia prices were $46.16 per barrel; these prices increased 31% and 12%, respectively. Malaysian prices were unfavorably affected by price sharing payments required in periods of high oil prices in accordance with the terms of the production sharing contract for Block SK 309. The average oil sales price in 2004 in the U.S. was $35.35 per barrel, up 46% from 2003. Canadian heavy oil prices increased 64% in 2004 and averaged $20.26 per barrel. The Companys sales price for production from the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields averaged $36.60 per barrel in 2004, up 35% versus 2003. Synthetic oil production at Syncrude averaged $40.35 per barrel in 2004, 62% higher than in 2003. Murphys U.K. North Sea oil production was sold at an average of $36.82 per barrel in 2004, 24% higher than 2003. Oil production in 2004 sold for $24.78 per barrel in Ecuador and $41.35 per barrel in Malaysia, increases of 8% and 41%, respectively. No sales occurred from Block 16 in Ecuador during 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the second half of 2004 due to a dispute with the fields operator over Murphys new transportation and marketing arrangements. Because of the lack of sales, the Companys Ecuador operations did not benefit from higher average oil prices during the last six months of 2004. In association with the higher oil prices, the sales prices for natural gas also strengthened in the Companys gas producing markets during each of the past two years. In 2005, the Companys sales price of North American natural gas averaged $8.44 per thousand cubic feet (MCF), an increase of 33% from 2004. In the U.K., the average sales price for natural gas was $5.80 per MCF, up 28% from 2004. The average 2004 realized sales price for North American natural gas was $6.34 per MCF, 24% higher than the previous year. The 2003 price was reduced by $.21 per MCF because of the Companys hedging program in the U.S. and Canada. Natural gas sales prices in the U.K. were up 29% in 2004 to $4.52 per MCF. Based on 2005 sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1 per barrel and $.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by $24.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses were $305.4 million in 2005, $249 million in 2004 and $189.6 million in 2003. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 36 and F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel excluding discontinued operations during the last three years are shown in the following table. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2005 2004 2003 United States $ 5.17 6.14 5.58 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 4.40 3.06 2.64 Synthetic oil 25.09 18.05 16.43 United Kingdom 5.10 4.25 4.69 Malaysia 6.98 5.63 3.44 Ecuador 7.07 11.18 9.05 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 5.31 4.89 4.11 The lower cost per equivalent barrel in the United States in 2005 was primarily due to start up of the Front Runner field in late 2004 and sale of higher cost properties in the Gulf of Mexico in mid 2005. The higher costs in the United States in 2004 were due primarily to lower production and higher costs for properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The increase in costs in Canada excluding synthetic oil in 2005 was due to a growing heavy oil production profile, lower production volume at the Terra Nova field and a higher foreign exchange rate. Higher average Canadian costs excluding synthetic oil in 2004 were caused by lower natural gas production and a higher average foreign exchange rate. The higher rate per barrel for Canadian synthetic oil operations in 2005 was due to higher maintenance, energy and compensation costs coupled with lower production and a higher foreign exchange rate, while the increase in unit costs for synthetic oil operations in 2004 was attributable to a combination of higher maintenance and energy costs and a higher foreign exchange rate. The higher average U.K. cost in 2005 was mostly due to higher maintenance costs and lower production at the Schiehallion and Mungo/Monan fields. Lower average cost in the U.K. in 2004 was mainly due to sale of the high cost T Block property during the year. The increase in the unit rate in Malaysia in 2005 was due to higher fuel and export duty costs, while the rate increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher manpower, fuel and export duty costs. Lower average costs per barrel in Ecuador in 2005 was due mostly to a new, less expensive arrangement for pipeline transportation that began near year end 2004. The increase per unit in Ecuador in 2004 was mostly attributable to higher transportation costs associated with the heavy oil pipeline that commenced operations in the second half of 2003. Exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 36 and F 37 on this Form 10 K report. Certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Exploration and production Dry holes $ 126.0 110.9 60.6 Geological and geophysical 73.4 28.4 31.2 Other 10.2 8.6 6.1 209.6 147.9 97.9 Undeveloped lease amortization 22.8 16.4 14.7 Total exploration expenses $ 232.4 164.3 112.6 Dry holes expense was up $15.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004 as higher unsuccessful exploratory drilling costs in the latest year offshore the Republic of Congo and Malaysia were only partially offset by lower costs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore eastern Canada. Dry 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements hole costs were $50.3 million higher in 2004 than 2003 because of more costs for unsuccessful drilling on the Scotian Shelf offshore eastern Canada, and in Block K Malaysia. Geological and geophysical (G&G) expenses were higher by $45 million in 2005 mostly due to more 3 D seismic acquisition and processing costs in Blocks SK 309/311 and PM 311/312, offshore Malaysia. G&G expenses were $2.8 million lower in 2004, mostly due to less seismic acquisition and interpretation work offshore eastern Canada, partially offset by seismic costs incurred in Malaysia. Other exploration expenses were $1.6 million higher in 2005 due mostly to more administrative costs in the Republic of Congo. Other exploration expenses were $2.5 million higher in 2004 than 2003 mainly due to more costs for Gulf of Mexico annual lease rentals and higher charges for work commitments on leases on the Scotian Shelf offshore eastern Canada. Undeveloped leasehold amortization increased by $6.4 million in 2005 and $1.7 million in 2004 because of lease acquisitions in each year in the Gulf of Mexico, a lease relinquishment in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 and the acquisition in 2004 of two exploration concessions in the deep waters offshore the Republic of Congo. Costs of $18.8 million and $2.6 million were incurred in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in the Companys exploration and production operations for uninsured costs to repair damages and to recognize associated higher insurance costs caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2004, the Company also recorded costs of $12.6 million for retrospective insurance premiums related to past claims experience of an insurance provider. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled $319.1 million in 2005, $241.5 million in 2004 and $198.6 million in 2003. The $77.6 million increase in 2005 versus 2004 was due to more crude oil production and larger per barrel costs in most areas generally caused by incurring higher capital costs to find and develop oil and natural gas reserves. The Company continues to experience higher drilling and related costs caused by a greater demand for such services based on the currently strong prices for oil and natural gas. The $42.9 million increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was caused primarily by higher production at the Medusa and Habanero fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the West Patricia field in Block SK 309 Malaysia. The exploration and production business recorded expenses of $9.6 million in 2005, $9.9 million in 2004 and $9.7 million in 2003 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. A property impairment charge of $3 million was recorded in 2003 to writedown the cost of a natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico due to a reserve reduction caused by poor well performance. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 39.1% in 2005, 32.7% in 2004 and 31.2% in 2003. The effective tax rate in 2005 was higher than the average U.S. statutory rate due to unrecognized income tax benefits on certain exploration and other expenses in Malaysia and the Republic of Congo. Each main exploration area in Malaysia is currently ring fenced and no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for Block H, offshore Sabah, and Blocks PM 311/312, offshore Peninsula Malaysia. The effective tax rates in 2004 and 2003 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate partially due to recognition of deferred income tax benefits in Malaysia in each year. The 2004 deferred tax benefit of $31.9 million arose due to the expectation that temporary differences associated with exploration and other expenses incurred to date in Block K Malaysia will be utilized to reduce future taxable income, and a deferred tax benefit of $11.4 million was recognized in 2003 for similar circumstances in Malaysia Blocks SK 309/311. These benefits had not been recognized in the income statement in previous years because the Company had established a deferred tax valuation allowance until such time that it became probable that these expenses would be utilized as deductions to reduce future taxable income. In 2004, Alberta reduced its tax rate for oil and gas companies, and in 2003, both the Federal and Alberta governments of Canada reduced their tax rates for oil and gas companies. These rate reductions led to recognition of tax benefits of $4.9 million in 2004 and $10.1 million in 2003, mostly due to reducing recorded deferred income tax liabilities. At December 31, 2005, approximately 42% of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 58% of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. Virtually all of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis) are associated with deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. About 43% of undeveloped reserves relate to the Front Runner field, which came on stream in December 2004. Further drilling and well workovers will be required to move undeveloped reserves to developed at Front Runner. In addition, all oil reserves for the Kikeh field in Block K Malaysia of 38.9 million barrels at year end 2005 are undeveloped, pending completion of facilities and development drilling prior to first oil, which is projected to occur in the second half of 2007. On a worldwide basis, the Company has spent approximately $378 million in 2005, $272 million in 2004 and $280 million in 2003 to develop proved reserves. The Company expects to spend about $660 million in 2006, $511 million in 2007 and $243 million in 2008 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing (R&M) operations generated profits of $125.3 million in 2005 and $81.9 million in 2004, after posting a loss of $11.2 million in 2003. In 2005, stronger R&M margins in both North America and the U.K. contributed to the 53% increase in profits compared to 2004. In North America, income contribution improved 60% mostly due to stronger marketing profits, while in the U.K., income improved 40% due to stronger profits in both refining and marketing. In 2004, R&M operating results improved markedly compared to 2003 because of a higher gross margin from product sales in both the North American and U.K. markets. Although the price of crude oil, the primary refinery feedstock, was much more costly during 2004 than in 2003, the supplies of gasoline and certain other products remained tight during much of the year, resulting in refining margins that were much stronger during 2004 in both the United States and United Kingdom. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Geographically, the North American R&M operations had income of $85.5 million in 2005 and $53.4 million in 2004 after incurring a loss of $21.2 million in 2003. North American operations include refining activities in the United States and marketing activities in the United States and Canada. The operating results for the Companys North American refining business were only slightly better in 2005 compared to 2004 as improved margins in the first eight months of 2005 prior to Hurricane Katrina were mostly offset by uninsured damages and higher insurance and other hurricane related costs in the last four months of the year. Throughout the industry, refining margins in North America were generally stronger in 2005 versus 2004 due to a robust U.S. economy that fueled demand and the effects of hurricanes in the U.S. that forced closure of several refineries (including the Companys Meraux, Louisiana plant), which temporarily limited supply of refined products. Because the Meraux refinery was damaged by floodwaters caused by Hurricane Katrina and was shut down for the last four months of 2005 for repairs, the Company did not capture refining margins at Meraux during the period of strongest profits in 2005. The refinery is expected to be back in operation early in the second quarter of 2006. In addition, uninsured repair costs and higher insurance costs in the wake of U.S. hurricanes led to incremental costs of about $26.8 million in North America. The Company anticipates incurring additional uninsured repair costs in the first half of 2006 at the Meraux plant. Operating results for the North American retail gasoline chain were stronger in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a combination of larger per gallon margins, higher average sales volume at each station for both fuel and non fuel products and the continued addition of sites. The Company continued to increase the size of its retail fuel operations in North America by adding 112 Murphy USA fueling stations in the parking lots of Wal Mart Supercenters in a 21 state area. This resulted in a 15% increase in the number of stores at year end 2005 versus the prior year. In 2004, the Meraux refinery ran more efficiently than in 2003, and therefore, the costs of operations were spread over a larger number of crude oil barrels, benefiting margins on a per unit basis. Murphy also enjoyed better profits in 2004 than in 2003 from its Murphy USA retail station chain, essentially due to a combination of higher volumes sold, higher prices and lower operating costs per gallon sold. The Company added 129 stations to its chain during 2004, an increase of 21% over the number of sites at year end 2003. Unit margins (sales realizations less costs of crude oil and other feedstocks, refinery operating and depreciation expenses and transportation to point of sale) averaged $2.96 per barrel in North America in 2005, $2.25 in 2004 and $1.60 in 2003. North American refined product sales volumes increased 7% to a record 322,171 barrels per day in 2005, following a 31% increase in 2004. Sales volumes through the Companys retail gasoline chain at Wal Mart Supercenters grew steadily each year, with the average volume per store increasing 9% in 2005 following a 6% rise in 2004. Operations in the United Kingdom generated a record profit of $39.8 million in 2005, compared to $28.5 million in 2004 and $10 million in 2003. The U.K. operation experienced its most profitable year in 2005 due to significantly improved refinery margins and slightly stronger marketing margins. The U.K. R&M business also expanded the size of its retail fueling operations by purchasing 68 existing stations during 2005. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $6.36 per barrel in 2005, $4.85 per barrel in 2004 and $2.86 per barrel in 2003. Sales of refined petroleum products were down 4% in 2005 following a 6% increase in 2004. The decline in 2005 was primarily caused by a turnaround during the year at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery. The 2004 increase was primarily caused by higher volumes sold in both the retail and cargo market. Based on sales volumes for 2005 and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $.42 per barrel ($.01 per gallon) fluctuation in the unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by $34.5 million. The effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys exploration and production segments could be affected differently. Corporate The costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $35.5 million in 2005, $97.8 million in 2004 and $13.8 million in 2003. Net after tax corporate costs were $62.3 million lower in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement in 2005 was attributable to favorable income tax benefits, higher interest income, lower net interest expense and more favorable foreign exchange impacts. These favorable effects were partially offset by higher administrative expenses in 2005. Income taxes were favorable by $23 million in the corporate area in 2005 due to lower net pretax costs and income tax benefits of $9.7 million, mostly due to refund and settlement of prior year income tax matters in the United States. In 2004, the Company incurred tax costs of $27.5 million for a 5% withholding tax on a dividend from a Canadian subsidiary. Interest income was favorable by $3.8 million in 2005 due mainly to interest received on the 2005 U.S. income tax refunds. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized to various development projects, was $25.3 million lower in 2005 than in 2004. Interest expense incurred was $8.9 million less in 2005 due to lower average borrowing levels, while amounts capitalized to major development projects such as the Syncrude expansion and Kikeh development increased by $16.4 million. The effects of foreign exchange resulted in an after tax expense of $18.6 million in 2004, but these effects were insignificant in 2005. The unfavorable result for foreign exchange in 2004 was caused by a significant weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, pound sterling and Euro currencies during that year. Administrative expenses in the corporate area were $15 million higher in 2005 than in 2004. The cost increase in 2005 was mostly attributable to higher executive compensation expense and higher salaries and benefits, with partial offsets due to lower Sarbanes Oxley compliance consulting costs. Net after tax corporate costs in 2004 were $84 million higher than in 2003, with the increase related to unfavorable foreign exchange losses, higher administrative costs, higher net interest expense and unfavorable income taxes. Higher interest income in 2004 partially offset these unfavorable variances. Due to a much weaker U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar, pound sterling and Euro in 2004, the Company incurred after tax losses of $18.6 million for foreign exchange in 2004 compared to a $5.4 million profit in 2003. The exchange losses were mostly caused by 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements foreign subsidiaries with non U.S. dollar functional currencies holding a significant amount of U.S. dollars that weakened against these other currencies during the last half of 2004. Administrative expenses were $8.5 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, mostly due to higher costs of corporate compliance under the Sarbanes Oxley Act and higher executive compensation and salaries and benefits. Net interest expense was $13.5 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, mostly due to lower interest being capitalized on U.S. oil and gas developments and U.S. refinery expansion projects. Income tax expense in 2004 was unfavorable by $43 million in the corporate area primarily due to a $27.5 million withholding tax incurred on a $550 million dividend paid to the Company by its Canadian subsidiary, and a $20.1 million tax benefit in 2003 from settlement of previous years income tax audit issues. The Company earned $13.3 million more interest income in 2004 mostly related to holding larger balances of invested cash for a portion of the year after selling most of its conventional oil and gas properties in western Canada. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 11 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures for continuing operations, including exploration expenditures, were $1,329.8 million in 2005 compared to $975.4 million in 2004 and $906.1 million in 2003. These amounts included $209.6 million, $147.9 million and $97.9 million of exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled $1,092 million in 2005, 82% of the Companys total capital expenditures for the year. Exploration and production capital expenditures in 2005 included $34.5 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, $404.5 million for exploration activities, and $652.9 million for development projects. Development expenditures included $58.7 million for deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico; $264.5 million for the West Patricia and Kikeh fields in Malaysia; $112.9 million for synthetic oil expansion and other capital at the Syncrude project in Canada; $111.1 million for western Canada heavy oil and natural gas projects; and $37 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 35 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $202.4 million in 2005, compared to $134.7 million in 2004 and $215.4 million in 2003. These amounts represented 15%, 14% and 24% of capital expenditures for continuing operations of the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Refining capital spending was $34.1 million in 2005 compared to $46.1 million in 2004 and $130.8 million in 2003. In 2004, the Company completed the construction of a green gasoline unit at its Superior, Wisconsin refinery. In 2003, the expansion of the Meraux, Louisiana refinery was completed, including building a hydrocracker unit to meet future clean fuel specifications and increasing the crude oil processing capacity of the plant to 125,000 barrels per day. Capital expenditures on the Superior refinery green gasoline unit were $18 million in 2004 and $5.5 million in 2003. Capital expenditures related to the Meraux expansion project amounted to $5.5 million in 2004 and $69 million in 2003. Marketing expenditures amounted to $168.2 million in 2005, $88.6 million in 2004 and $84.6 million in 2003. The majority of marketing expenditures in each year was related to construction of retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart Supercenters in 21 states in the U.S. The Company added 112 total stations to this retail station network in 2005, 129 in 2004 and 119 in 2003. In 2005, the Company also purchased 68 retail fueling stations in the U.K., thereby expanding its company owned retail station count by 70%. Cash Flows Cash provided by continuing operations was $1,216.7 million in 2005, $1,035.1 million in 2004 and $501.1 million in 2003. The increase in cash provided in each of the last two years compared to the immediately preceding year was primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product sales volumes, and higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Cash provided by continuing operations was reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $31.9 million in 2005, $18.6 million in 2004 and $66.1 million in 2003. A scheduled refinery turnaround occurred at Milford Haven in 2005 and at both U.S. refineries in 2003. Cash proceeds from property sales other than from discontinued operations were $172.7 million in 2005, $60.4 million in 2004 and $188.6 million in 2003. The 2005 proceeds were mainly attributable to sale of most oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico; the Company retained its deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties. The 2004 property sales included the disposal of the T Block field in the U.K. North Sea and certain U.S. onshore gas properties and U.S. marketing terminals, while 2003 included disposal of the Ninian and Columba fields in the U.K. and various oil and gas assets in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Property sales which have been classified as discontinued operations brought in net cash proceeds of $583 million in 2004, and included sale of most of the Companys conventional oil and gas properties in western Canada. During 2003, the Company borrowed $309.7 million under notes payable and other long term debt arrangements primarily to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures. Maturity of U.S. government securities provided cash of $17.9 million in 2005. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans amounted to $26.5 million in 2005, $3.2 million in 2004 and $3.6 million in 2003. Property additions and dry hole costs used cash of $1,246.2 million in 2005, $938.4 million in 2004 and $868.9 million in 2003. The increase in 2005 was mainly caused by development activities at the Kikeh field offshore Sabah, Malaysia, and acquisition of 68 retail fueling stations in the U.K. In 2004, the increases were primarily due to a heavy oil property acquisition in Canada, plus higher heavy oil development spending and higher exploration drilling in Malaysia. Cash used in other investing activities of $9.9 million in 2005 primarily related to advances under future equipment rental agreements in Malaysia. The Company repaid debt of $50.6 million in 2005 using a combination of internal cash flow and proceeds from sale of assets. Total paydown of debt was $495 million during 2004 and was mostly accomplished using a portion of the proceeds of asset dispositions classified as discontinued operations. Cash outlays for debt repayment during 2003 were $76.8 million. Cash of 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $17.9 million was invested in 2004 in U.S. government securities with maturities greater than 90 days. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $83.2 million in 2005, $78.2 million in 2004 and $73.5 million in 2003. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $.40 per share to $.45 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2004. Financial Condition Year end working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) totaled $551.9 million in 2005, $424.4 million in 2004 and $228.5 million in 2003. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in first out accounting was $361.3 million below fair value at December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2005 totaled $585.3 million compared to $535.5 million a year ago and $252.4 million at the end of 2003. The long term portion of debt was reduced by $3.8 million during 2005 and totaled $609.6 million at the end of 2005, which represented 15% of total capital employed. Long term debt included $11.6 million of nonrecourse debt borrowed in connection with the Hibernia oil field development. Long term debt declined by $477 million in 2004 as the Company utilized the proceeds of asset dispositions in western Canada to pay down debt. Stockholders equity was $3.46 billion at the end of 2005 compared to $2.65 billion a year ago and $1.95 billion at the end of 2003. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 6 of this Form 10 K report. Other significant changes in Murphys year end 2005 balance sheet compared to 2004 included a $162.2 million increase in accounts receivable, which was caused by higher sales volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products at higher average prices near the end of 2005 compared to 2004, and amounts recoverable from insurance companies at year end 2005. These amounts recoverable from insurance companies mostly related to hurricane related repair costs at the Meraux refinery. Inventory values were $19.1 million more at year end 2005 than in 2004 mostly because of more crude oil barrels in storage at the Meraux refinery and more drilling equipment held in inventory in Malaysia. Prepaid expenses declined $12.5 million due to refund of prior years U.S. income taxes due from the IRS. Short term deferred income tax assets increased $8.9 million at year end 2005 due mostly to a deferred tax benefit recorded in 2005 in the Companys U.K. downstream business caused by a higher short term temporary difference for the LIFO inventory allowance in the current period. Net property, plant and equipment increased by $688.6 million in 2005 as capital expenditures during the year were larger than the book values of properties sold and the additional depreciation and amortization expensed. Goodwill related to the acquisition of Beau Canada in 2000 increased by $.6 million in 2005 primarily due to a higher Canadian dollar exchange rate in the current year. Deferred charges and other assets increased $11.4 million in 2005 due mostly to prepayments on future asset rentals for the Kikeh field in Malaysia. Current maturities of long term debt declined by $46.2 million primarily because of paydown of loans used to partially fund the Beau Canada acquisition in 2000. Accounts payable rose by $277.9 million mostly due to the higher costs of purchased crude oil and gasoline at year end 2005 compared to 2004 and higher amounts owed on exploration and production capital projects. Income taxes payable decreased $136.1 million at year end 2005 due to a combination of paying higher tax installments in 2005 and settlement of a tax liability with the Canadian tax authorities in 2005. Other taxes payable decreased $33.7 million mostly due to lower sales, use and excise taxes owed at year end 2005 compared to 2004 primarily caused by the Meraux refinery being down for repairs at the end of the year. Deferred income tax liabilities increased $37 million in 2005 due mostly to higher accelerated depreciation deductions taken in tax returns based on 2005 capital expenditures. The liability associated with asset retirements dropped by $25.1 million mostly due to purchasing companies accepting responsibility for the abandonment liabilities associated with oil and gas properties sold by the Company on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico during 2005. Accrued major repair costs increased by $11.1 million primarily based on accruing additional costs for future turnarounds of the Companys three refineries, which exceeded the amounts expended in 2005 at the Milford Haven refinery turnaround that were charged against this liability. Murphy had commitments for future capital projects of $932 million at December 31, 2005, including $57 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, $585 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, $69 million for exploration drilling in the Republic of Congo and $73 million for future work commitments on the Scotian Shelf offshore eastern Canada. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, and maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2005, the Company had access to long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of $1 billion. No amounts were borrowed under these revolving facilities at year end 2005. The credit facilities were renewed and increased by $300 million in mid 2005. The most restrictive covenants under these existing facilities limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. At December 31, 2005, the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 15%. The Company also has available uncommitted credit lines of approximately $774 million at December 31, 2005. In addition, the Company has a shelf registration on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of up to $650 million in debt and or equity securities. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note E to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates utilizing about $100 million of its long term borrowing capacity in 2006 to fund certain development projects, including the Kikeh field in Malaysia. Such borrowing amounts are subject to change based on actual levels of cash flows and capital spending. At March 1, 2006, the Companys long term debt rating by Standard & Poors was A and by Moodys Investors Service was Baa1. On February 21, 2006, Moodys placed its rating of the Company under review for possible downgrade. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 24.7 to 1 in 2005, 13.4 to 1 in 2004 and 6.1 to 1 in 2003. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Environmental Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the Companys operations are: The U.S. Clean Air Act, which regulates air emissions The U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges into U.S. waters The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes The U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells Regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations These laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of water discharges. They also, generally, require permits for new or modified operations. Many states and foreign countries where Murphy operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water, which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements. Murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills. CERCLA, commonly referred to as the Superfund Act and comparable state statutes, primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites. As discussed below, Murphy is involved in a limited number of Superfund sites. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous. RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owners property. Under OPA90, owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used. Several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The EPAs standard for highway diesel fuel sulfur limits becomes effective for the Company in 2006. World leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. As part of these discussions, a Kyoto agreement was adopted in 1997 that has been ratified by certain countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future, with the United States being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement. The U.S. may ratify all or a portion of the agreement in the future. The agreement became effective for ratifying countries in early 2005 and these countries are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents. The Company is unable to predict how final regulations associated with the agreement will impact its costs in future years, but it is reasonable to expect these regulations to increase its compliance costs to some degree. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the Companys operations. The Company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities, including three refineries, five terminals, and approximately 62 service stations, for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist. In addition the Company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation. Under the Companys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. The Companys liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. Although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently considers the Company to be a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at two Superfund sites. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. Based on currently available information, the Company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at both Superfund sites. The Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other Superfund sites. The Company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean up the two Superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites. However, based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at December 31, 2005. The Companys refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils; laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and various industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to $3.5 million in 2005. In addition to these expenses, Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Such capital expenditures were approximately $53.2 million in 2005 and are projected to be $63.1 million in 2006. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Because crude oil and natural gas sales prices have generally strengthened during the last two years, prices for oil field goods and services have risen and could continue to be adversely affected in the future. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements As described in Note G on page F 14 of this Form 10 K report, Murphy adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Company recorded an after tax charge of $7 million, which was reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The FASB has issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2005), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2005) requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized as an expense in the financial statements using a fair value based measurement method over the periods that the awards vest. The statement will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2006. Although the Company used the intrinsic value approach of Accounting Principles Board No. 25 to account for stock options through year end 2005, it provided pro forma disclosures in Note A as if SFAS No. 123 was currently being applied. The Company expects to use the modified prospective transition method upon adoption of SFAS 123 (revised). Stock option awards are expected to qualify for accounting as equity awards. The adoption of this statement will increase compensation expense in the consolidated statement of income beginning in 2006 by including cost for the Companys stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company has preliminarily estimated this incremental expense to be $10 million in 2006. The FASB has issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 19 1, Accounting for Suspended Well Costs, to provide guidance on the accounting for exploratory well costs and to amend SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies. The guidance in FSP 19 1 applies to companies that use the successful efforts method of accounting as described in SFAS No. 19. This FSP clarifies that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The guidance in this FSP was applied beginning in April 2005 on a prospective basis to existing and newly capitalized exploratory wells costs. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this FSP did not have any effect on the Companys net income or financial condition. In October 2004, the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) became law. The FASB issued FSP 109 1 in December 2004 to provide guidance on the application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the provision within the Act that provides, beginning in 2005, a tax deduction on qualified production activities. The tax deduction phases in at 3% in 2005 and reaches 9% in 2010. FSP 109 1 concluded that the tax benefits for the deduction should be recognized as realized. This FSP was effective upon issuance and the Company applied it in computing U.S. income tax expense in 2005. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $3.5 million in 2005 related to the Act. The Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB has issued EITF 03 13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of SFAS No. 144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. The EITF generally believes that current practice with respect to applying the criteria in paragraph 42 of SFAS No. 144 has not been applied consistently and has not resulted in broadening the reporting of asset dispositions as discontinued operations. EITF 03 13 contains further guidance for evaluating the cash flows of the component sold and what constitutes significant continuing involvement. In certain industries, EITF 03 13 may lead to more asset disposals being reported as discontinued operations in future periods. However, in the oil and gas industry, it may cause more asset disposals to continue to be classified as continuing operations due to clarification of what constitutes continuing involvement. This standard was adopted by the Company for all asset disposal transactions occurring after January 1, 2005. SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, was issued by the FASB in November 2004. This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges, and it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the related production facilities. The provisions of this statement will be effective on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006, and the Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on its results of operations. The FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, in December 2004. This statement addressed the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and eliminated the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaced it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 was adopted by the Company on a prospective basis for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after June 30, 2005. The adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations in 2005. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of SFAS No. 143. This interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143 and when a company would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This interpretation was adopted by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2005 and it had no impact on the Companys results of operations for 2005. In March 2005, the EITF decided in Issue 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry, that mining operations should account for post production stripping costs as a variable production cost that should be considered a component of mineral inventory costs. The Companys synthetic oil operations at Syncrude may be affected by this ruling. The EITF consensus is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2006 and any adjustment required as of the effective application date will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company does not currently expect the adoption of this consensus to have a significant impact on its financial statements. In September 2005, the EITF decided in Issue 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, that two or more exchange transactions involving inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined for purposes of evaluating the effect of APB Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Additionally, the EITF decided that a nonmonetary exchange where an entity transfers finished goods inventory in exchange for the receipt of raw materials or work in progress inventory within the same line of business should generally be recognized by the entity at fair value. This consensus will be applied to new arrangements entered into beginning April 1, 2006, and to all inventory transactions that are completed after December 15, 2006, for arrangements entered into prior to March 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of this consensus to have a significant impact on its financial statements. In 2005, the FASB added to its agenda a reconsideration of accounting and disclosures rules related to retirement and postretirement plans. The FASB has stated that it will first consider whether the funded status of benefit plans should be reported as an asset or liability on the plan sponsors balance sheet. The FASBs reconsideration of all other aspects of the accounting for retirement and postretirement plans will follow thereafter. The FASBs goal is to conclude as to the first matter with any accounting changes required by the end of 2006. The Company is unable to predict the changes to its accounting policies and disclosures, or the applicable timing thereof, that may arise upon completion of this FASB review. Other Murphy holds a 20% interest in Block 16 Ecuador, where the Company and its partners produce oil for export. In 2001, the local tax authorities announced that Value Added Taxes (VAT) paid on goods and services related to Block 16 and many oil fields held by other companies will no longer be reimbursed. In response to this announcement, oil producers have filed actions in the Ecuador Tax Court seeking determination that the VAT in question is reimbursable. In July 2004, international arbitrators ruled that VAT was recoverable by another oil company, but the State of Ecuador responded that it was not bound by this arbitral decision. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has a 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements receivable of approximately $15.3 million related to VAT. Murphy believes that its claim for reimbursement of VAT under applicable Ecuador tax law is valid, and it does not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse affect on the Companys net income, financial condition or liquidity in future periods. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies are described below. Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities. Year end prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Companys depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. The Companys proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages F 33 and F 34 of the annual report. The U.S. oil reserve revision in 2005 was mostly due to poor well performance at the deepwater Front Runner field. Oil reserve revisions in 2005 in Canada, the U.K. and Ecuador were due to better field performance, while the Malaysia revision was caused by higher oil prices that reduce volumes allocable to the Company for cost recovery under production sharing contracts. The reserve revision for U.S. oil in 2004 related primarily to loss of royalty relief for the Medusa and Front Runner deepwater fields based on year end 2004 oil prices. Oil reserve revisions in Canada in 2004 related to a combination of low heavy oil prices at year end that restricted economic recoverability of certain heavy oil reserves and higher projected royalties at the Terra Nova and Hibernia fields. Oil reserve revisions in Ecuador in 2004 were caused by a higher than previously estimated water cut in the liquid stream produced at Block 16. Natural gas reserve revisions were positive in the U.S. in 2004 due to better well performance. The Company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. In some cases, a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately. This is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon(s) found. The determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is, in turn, usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves. Under current accounting rules, the Company holds well costs in Property, Plant and Equipment when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Costs for an exploration well in progress at year end 2005 amounted to $6 million. Through February 2006, the well was determined to have successfully found hydrocarbon deposits. Based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked, dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred. Dry hole expenses related to wells drilled in prior years were $13.2 million in 2004; there were no dry holes in 2005 that were drilled in prior years. Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a propertys carrying value for possible impairment. A description of impairment charges recorded during the last three years is included in Note D in the consolidated financial statements. In making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment, the Company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices, future production volumes, and future capital and operating costs. Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the Companys projections. Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserve and production estimates as new information becomes available. The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. In making impairment assessments for refining and marketing property and equipment, future margins for the refining and marketing business are generally projected based on historical results adjusted for known or expected changes in future operations. Although the Company is not aware of any property carrying values that are impaired at December 31, 2005, one or a combination of factors such as significantly lower future sales prices, significantly lower future production, significantly higher future costs, or significantly lower future margins for refining and marketing, could lead to impairment expenses in future periods. Based on these unknown future factors as described herein, the Company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to property basis differences and liabilities for repairs, dismantlements and retirement benefits. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for Blocks H and PM 311/312 in Malaysia, exploration licenses in the Republic of Congo and certain basis differences in the U.K. due to managements belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are adjusted as necessary, generally based on changes in AA rated corporate bond rates. Expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs. Due to a reduction in bond yields during 2005, the Company has reduced the primary plans discount rate from 6.00% in 2005 to 5.70% in 2006. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 7.25% for the primary plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns. The effects of a lower discount rate and a growing employee population are expected to lead to higher pension expense in 2006. The Companys annual retirement plan expense is estimated to increase by about $2 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In 2005, the Company paid $26.4 million into various retirement plans, including a $14.5 million voluntary payment into the U.S. qualified retirement plan, and $3.5 million into postretirement plans. In 2006, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $7.5 million into various retirement plans and $3.5 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. As described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2006 annual retirement and postretirement expenses by $2.5 million and $.5 million, respectively, and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2006 retirement expense by $1.5 million. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments, and other long term liabilities. In addition, the Company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period. Total payments due after 2005 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below. Amount of Obligation (Millions of dollars) Total 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Total debt including current maturities $ 614.1 4.5 11.7 597.9 Operating leases 214.1 19.7 53.7 26.2 114.5 Purchase obligations 1,118.6 954.9 62.7 18.9 82.1 Other long term liabilities 262.4 20.0 2.3 3.7 236.4 Total $ 2,209.2 999.1 130.4 48.8 1,030.9 A floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel is currently being built by other companies and it is anticipated to be used in producing the Kikeh field in Block K Malaysia, which is scheduled to start up production in the second half of 2007. The Company will lease this FPSO subject to satisfactory completion of construction by its owners. Certain amounts to be paid by the Company through completion of the FPSO construction period totaling $29 million have been included in the contractual obligation table above in 2006 and 2007. If the FPSO is accepted by the Company in 2007, future undiscounted lease commitments will amount to $631 million; these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligation table above pending successful construction of the FPSO. Accounting treatment for this lease will be determined upon satisfactory delivery of the FPSO. In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments as of December 31, 2005 that expire in future periods is shown below. Amount of Commitment (Millions of dollars) Total 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Financial guarantees $ 8.5 2.6 5.9 Letters of credit 50.2 9.3 40.8 0.1 Total $ 58.7 9.3 43.4 0.1 5.9 Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2005 involve an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract. The processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the Medusa field in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the contract, the Company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility. If actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through 2009 is less than a specified quantity, the Company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time. The Company has a contract to purchase hydrogen for the Meraux refinery through 2019. The contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased. Payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid. Future required minimum annual payments under both of these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above. Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. A strong global economy, which fueled demand for oil and natural gas, led to strong prices for these products during most of 2005 and into early 2006. Due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil and North American natural gas prices, routine monitoring of spending plans is required. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2006 was prepared during the fall of 2005 and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to increase over 2005. Capital expenditures in 2006 are projected to total $1.6 billion. Of this amount, $1.35 billion or about 85%, is allocated for the exploration and production program. Geographically, E&P capital is spread approximately as follows: 20% for the United States, 55% for Malaysia, 10% for Canada and 15% for all other areas. Spending in the U.S. is dominated by exploration and appraisal 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements drilling in the deepwater Thunderhawk area, plus early spending on an anticipated development of the Thunderhawk field. In Malaysia, over half of the spending is for continued development of the Kikeh field in Block K and the remainder includes exploration and development activities for other areas held by the Company. Spending in the Republic of Congo includes studies for development options for the Azurite Marine discovery offshore. Refining and marketing expenditures in 2006 should be about $225 million of which almost 90% is allocated to the U.S. The U.S. budget has funds for construction of additional retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart Supercenters and pipeline and terminal investments needed to support this growing retail marketing system. Capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during 2006. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases, which often are not anticipated at the time the Budget is prepared. The Company currently expects to fund certain development costs in 2006, primarily at the Kikeh field in Block K Malaysia, using available credit facilities. Most other funding is anticipated to be generated from operating cash flow. The Company forecasts a growth in long term debt of approximately $100 million in 2006. This forecast could change based on actual cash flow generated from operations and actual levels of capital spending. For example, a significant reduction in sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, without a corresponding decrease in capital spending, could cause the Companys long term debt to rise by more than the current forecast. In early 2006, oil prices remained stronger than those forecast in the Companys 2006 budget, but natural gas prices had retreated to below budgeted levels. In early 2006, the Company was experiencing losses in its North American refining and marketing business due to actual margins being well below margin levels forecast in the budget. The Company currently expects production in 2006 to be about 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Growth in oil volumes based on start up of new coker facilities at Syncrude and an anticipated successful heavy oil development drilling program that is ongoing in western Canada is expected to be more than offset by lower volumes at Terra Nova due to more downtime for repairs, lower volumes allocable to Murphy at West Patricia under the production sharing contract, and decline at Front Runner in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production will be favorably impacted by start up of the Seventeen Hands field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, but other volumes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico are likely to be lower prior to workovers and volumes in the U.K. are expected to be lower at the Amethyst field. The repair of flood and wind damages at the Meraux refinery has been estimated to cost up to $200 million. Because of certain limitations on insurance policies for flooding, the Meraux refinery could have unrecoverable repair costs of up to $50 million in the first half of 2006. See Item 3 of this Form 10 K report for additional information regarding environmental and other contingencies relating to Hurricane Katrina. The U.K. government announced in 2005 that the effective income tax rate on E&P earnings will increase from 40% to 50% beginning in 2006. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has not recognized the estimated charge of approximately $11 million to increase deferred income tax liabilities because the 10% rate increase has not been confirmed by the U.K. Parliament. This action is expected to be approved by Parliament and the unfavorable deferred tax adjustment is expected to be recorded in 2006. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K report, including documents incorporated by reference here, contains statements of the Companys expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the Companys control.

Actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the Companys January 15, 1997 Form 8 K report on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. Murphy was a party to natural gas price swap agreements at December 31, 2005 for a remaining notional volume of 720,000 MMBTU (1 MMBTU 1 milion British Thermal Units) that are intended to hedge the financial exposure of its Meraux, Louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the future price of a portion of natural gas to be purchased for fuel in 2006. In each month of settlement, the swaps require Murphy to pay an average natural gas price of $3.35 per MMBTU and to receive the average NYMEX price for the final three trading days of the month. At December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of $5.2 million. A 10% increase in the average NYMEX price of natural gas would have increased this asset by $.8 million, while a 10% decrease would have reduced the asset by a similar amount. At December 31, 2005, the Company was a party to forward sale contracts covering 4,000 barrels per day in heavy oil sales during 2006. The contracts are intended to hedge the financial exposure of the Companys heavy oil sales in Canada during the respective contract period and are priced at $25.23 per barrel in 2006. At December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as a liability valued at $24.3 million. A 10% increase in the price of Canadian heavy oil at the Hardisty terminal in Canada would have increased this liability by $6.1 million, while a 10% decrease would have decreased this liability by a similar amount. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
